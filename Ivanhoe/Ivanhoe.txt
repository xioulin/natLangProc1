Now ﬁtted the halter, now traversed the cart,And often took leave,—but seemed loath to depart! 1—Prior.INTRODUCTION TO IV ANHOE.The Author of the Waverley Novels had hitherto proceeded in an unabated course of popularity, and might, in his peculiar district ofliterature, have been termed L’Enfant Gâté of success. It was plain, however, that frequent publication must ﬁnally wear out the publicfavour, unless some mode could be devised to give an appearance of novelty to subsequent productions. Scottish manners, Scottishdialect, and Scottish characters of note, being those with which the author was most intimately, and familiarly acquainted, were thegroundwork upon which he had hitherto relied for giving effect to his narrative. It was, however, obvious, that this kind of interestmust in the end occasion a degree of sameness and repetition, if exclusively resorted to, and that the reader was likely at length toadopt the language of Edwin, in Parnell’s Tale:“‘Reverse the spell,’ he cries,‘And let it fairly now sufﬁce.The gambol has been shown.’”Nothing can be more dangerous for the fame of a professor of the ﬁne arts, than to permit (if he can possibly prevent it) thecharacter of a mannerist to be attached to him, or that he should be supposed capable of success only in a particular and limited style.The public are, in general, very ready to adopt the opinion, that he who has pleased them in one peculiar mode of composition, is, bymeans of that very talent, rendered incapable of venturing upon other subjects. The effect of this disinclination, on the part of thepublic, towards the artiﬁcers of their pleasures, when they attempt to enlarge their means of amusing, may be seen in the censuresusually passed by vulgar criticism upon actors or artists who venture to change the character of their efforts, that, in so doing, theymay enlarge the scale of their art.There is some justice in this opinion, as there always is in such as attain general currency. It may often happen on the stage, that anactor, by possessing in a preeminent degree the external qualities necessary to give effect to comedy, may be deprived of the right toaspire to tragic excellence; and in painting or literary composition, an artist or poet may be master exclusively of modes of thought,and powers of expression, which conﬁne him to a single course of subjects. But much more frequently the same capacity which carriesa man to popularity in one department will obtain for him success in another, and that must be more particularly the case in literarycomposition, than either in acting or painting, because the adventurer in that department is not impeded in his exertions by anypeculiarity of features, or conformation of person, proper for particular parts, or, by any peculiar mechanical habits of using the pencil,limited to a particular class of subjects.Whether this reasoning be correct or otherwise, the present author felt, that, in conﬁning himself to subjects purely Scottish, he wasnot only likely to weary out the indulgence of his readers, but also greatly to limit his own power of affording them pleasure. In ahighly polished country, where so much genius is monthly employed in catering for public amusement, a fresh topic, such as he hadhimself had the happiness to light upon, is the untasted spring of the desert;—“Men bless their stars and call it luxury.”But when men and horses, cattle, camels, and dromedaries, have poached the spring into mud, it becomes loathsome to those who atﬁrst drank of it with rapture; and he who had the merit of discovering it, if he would preserve his reputation with the tribe, mustdisplay his talent by a fresh discovery of untasted fountains.If the author, who ﬁnds himself limited to a particular class of subjects, endeavours to sustain his reputation by striving to add anovelty of attraction to themes of the same character which have been formerly successful under his management, there are manifestreasons why, after a certain point, he is likely to fail. If the mine be not wrought out, the strength and capacity of the miner becomenecessarily exhausted. If he closely imitates the narratives which he has before rendered successful, he is doomed to “wonder that theyplease no more.” If he struggles to take a different view of the same class of subjects, he speedily discovers that what is obvious,graceful, and natural, has been exhausted; and, in order to obtain the indispensable charm of novelty, he is forced upon caricature, and,to avoid being trite, must become extravagant.It is not, perhaps, necessary to enumerate so many reasons why the author of the Scottish Novels, as they were then exclusivelytermed, should be desirous to make an experiment on a subject purely English. It was his purpose, at the same time, to have renderedthe experiment as complete as possible, by bringing the intended work before the public as the effort of a new candidate for theirfavour, in order that no degree of prejudice, whether favourable or the reverse, might attach to it, as a new production of the Author ofWaverley; but this intention was afterwards departed from, for reasons to be hereafter mentioned.The period of the narrative adopted was the reign of Richard I., not only as abounding with characters whose very names were sureto attract general attention, but as affording a striking contrast betwixt the Saxons, by whom the soil was cultivated, and the Normans,who still reigned in it as conquerors, reluctant to mix with the vanquished, or acknowledge themselves of the same stock. The idea ofthis contrast was taken from the ingenious and unfortunate Logan’s tragedy of Runnamede, in which, about the same period of history,the author had seen the Saxon and Norman barons opposed to each other on different sides of the stage. He does not recollect thatthere was any attempt to contrast the two races in their habits and sentiments; and indeed it was obvious, that history was violated byintroducing the Saxons still existing as a high-minded and martial race of nobles.They did, however, survive as a people, and some of the ancient Saxon families possessed wealth and power, although they wereexceptions to the humble condition of the race in general. It seemed to the author, that the existence of the two races in the samecountry, the vanquished distinguished by their plain, homely, blunt manners, and the free spirit infused by their ancient institutions andlaws; the victors, by the high spirit of military fame, personal adventure, and whatever could distinguish them as the Flower ofChivalry, might, intermixed with other characters belonging to the same time and country, interest the reader by the contrast, if theauthor should not fail on his part.Scotland, however, had been of late used so exclusively as the scene of what is called Historical Romance, that the preliminaryletter of Mr Laurence Templeton became in some measure necessary. To this, as to an Introduction, the reader is referred, asexpressing the author’s purpose and opinions in undertaking this species of composition, under the necessary reservation, that he is farfrom thinking he has attained the point at which he aimed.It is scarcely necessary to add, that there was no idea or wish to pass off the supposed Mr Templeton as a real person. But a kind ofcontinuation of the Tales of my Landlord had been recently attempted by a stranger, and it was supposed this Dedicatory Epistle mightpass for some imitation of the same kind, and thus putting enquirers upon a false scent, induce them to believe they had before themthe work of some new candidate for their favour.After a considerable part of the work had been ﬁnished and printed, the Publishers, who pretended to discern in it a germ ofpopularity, remonstrated strenuously against its appearing as an absolutely anonymous production, and contended that it should havethe advantage of being announced as by the Author of Waverley. The author did not make any obstinate opposition, for he began to beof opinion with Dr Wheeler, in Miss Edgeworth’s excellent tale of “Maneuvering,” that “Trick upon Trick” might be too much for thepatience of an indulgent public, and might be reasonably considered as triﬂing with their favour.The book, therefore, appeared as an avowed continuation of the Waverley Novels; and it would be ungrateful not to acknowledge,that it met with the same favourable reception as its predecessors.Such annotations as may be useful to assist the reader in comprehending the characters of the Jew, the Templar, the Captain of themercenaries, or Free Companions, as they were called, and others proper to the period, are added, but with a sparing hand, sincesufﬁcient information on these subjects is to be found in general history.An incident in the tale, which had the good fortune to ﬁnd favour in the eyes of many readers, is more directly borrowed from thestores of old romance. I mean the meeting of the King with Friar Tuck at the cell of that buxom hermit. The general tone of the storybelongs to all ranks and all countries, which emulate each other in describing the rambles of a disguised sovereign, who, going insearch of information or amusement, into the lower ranks of life, meets with adventures diverting to the reader or hearer, from thecontrast betwixt the monarch’s outward appearance, and his real character. The Eastern tale-teller has for his theme the disguisedexpeditions of Haroun Alraschid with his faithful attendants, Mesrour and Giafar, through the midnight streets of Bagdad; and Scottishtradition dwells upon the similar exploits of James V ., distinguished during such excursions by the travelling name of the Goodman ofBallengeigh, as the Commander of the Faithful, when he desired to be incognito, was known by that of Il Bondocani. The Frenchminstrels are not silent on so popular a theme. There must have been a Norman original of the Scottish metrical romance of RaufColziar, in which Charlemagne is introduced as the unknown guest of a charcoal-man. 2It seems to have been the original of other poems of the kind.In merry England there is no end of popular ballads on this theme. The poem of John the Reeve, or Steward, mentioned by BishopPercy, in the Reliques of English Poetry, 3 is said to have turned on such an incident; and we have besides, the King and the Tanner ofTamworth, the King and the Miller of Mansﬁeld, and others on the same topic. But the peculiar tale of this nature to which the authorof Ivanhoe has to acknowledge an obligation, is more ancient by two centuries than any of these last mentioned.It was ﬁrst communicated to the public in that curious record of ancient literature, which has been accumulated by the combinedexertions of Sir Egerton Brydges and Mr Hazlewood, in the periodical work entitled the British Bibliographer. From thence it has beentransferred by the Reverend Charles Henry Hartshorne, M.A., editor of a very curious volume, entitled “Ancient Metrical Tales,printed chieﬂy from original sources, 1829.” Mr Hartshorne gives no other authority for the present fragment, except the article in theBibliographer, where it is entitled the Kyng and the Hermite. A short abstract of its contents will show its similarity to the meeting ofKing Richard and Friar Tuck.King Edward (we are not told which among the monarchs of that name, but, from his temper and habits, we may suppose EdwardIV .) sets forth with his court to a gallant hunting-match in Sherwood Forest, in which, as is not unusual for princes in romance, he fallsin with a deer of extraordinary size and swiftness, and pursues it closely, till he has outstripped his whole retinue, tired out hounds andhorse, and ﬁnds himself alone under the gloom of an extensive forest, upon which night is descending. Under the apprehensionsnatural to a situation so uncomfortable, the king recollects that he has heard how poor men, when apprehensive of a bad nightslodging, pray to Saint Julian, who, in the Romish calendar, stands Quarter-Master-General to all forlorn travellers that render him duehomage. Edward puts up his orisons accordingly, and by the guidance, doubtless, of the good Saint, reaches a small path, conductinghim to a chapel in the forest, having a hermit’s cell in its close vicinity. The King hears the reverend man, with a companion of hissolitude, telling his beads within, and meekly requests of him quarters for the night. “I have no accommodation for such a lord as yebe,” said the Hermit. “I live here in the wilderness upon roots and rinds, and may not receive into my dwelling even the poorest wretchthat lives, unless it were to save his life.” The King enquires the way to the next town, and, understanding it is by a road which hecannot ﬁnd without difﬁculty, even if he had daylight to befriend him, he declares, that with or without the Hermit’s consent, he isdetermined to be his guest that night. He is admitted accordingly, not without a hint from the Recluse, that were he himself out of hispriestly weeds, he would care little for his threats of using violence, and that he gives way to him not out of intimidation, but simply toavoid scandal.The King is admitted into the cell—two bundles of straw are shaken down for his accommodation, and he comforts himself that heis now under shelter, and that“A night will soon be gone.”Other wants, however, arise. The guest becomes clamorous for supper, observing,“For certainly, as I you say,I ne had never so sorry a day,    That I ne had a merry night.”But this indication of his taste for good cheer, joined to the annunciation of his being a follower of the Court, who had lost himselfat the great hunting-match, cannot induce the niggard Hermit to produce better fare than bread and cheese, for which his guest showedlittle appetite; and “thin drink,” which was even less acceptable. At length the King presses his host on a point to which he had morethan once alluded, without obtaining a satisfactory reply:“Then said the King, ‘by God’s grace,Thou wert in a merry place,    To shoot should thou hereWhen the foresters go to rest,Sometyme thou might have of the best,    All of the wild deer;I wold hold it for no scathe,Though thou hadst bow and arrows baith,    Althoff thou best a Frere.’”The Hermit, in return, expresses his apprehension that his guest means to drag him into some confession of offence against theforest laws, which, being betrayed to the King, might cost him his life. Edward answers by fresh assurances of secrecy, and againurges on him the necessity of procuring some venison. The Hermit replies, by once more insisting on the duties incumbent upon himas a churchman, and continues to afﬁrm himself free from all such breaches of order:“Many day I have here been,And ﬂesh-meat I eat never,    But milk of the kye;Warm thee well, and go to sleep,And I will lap thee with my cope,    Softly to lye.”It would seem that the manuscript is here imperfect, for we do not ﬁnd the reasons which ﬁnally induce the curtal Friar to amend theKing’s cheer. But acknowledging his guest to be such a “good fellow” as has seldom graced his board, the holy man at lengthproduces the best his cell affords. Two candles are placed on a table, white bread and baked pasties are displayed by the light, besideschoice of venison, both salt and fresh, from which they select collops. “I might have eaten my bread dry,” said the King, “had I notpressed thee on the score of archery, but now have I dined like a prince—if we had but drink enow.”This too is afforded by the hospitable anchorite, who dispatches an assistant to fetch a pot of four gallons from a secret corner nearhis bed, and the whole three set in to serious drinking. This amusement is superintended by the Friar, according to the recurrence ofcertain fustian words, to be repeated by every compotator in turn before he drank—a species of High Jinks, as it were, by which theyregulated their potations, as toasts were given in latter times. The one toper says “fusty bandias”, to which the other is obliged to reply,“strike pantnere”, and the Friar passes many jests on the King’s want of memory, who sometimes forgets the words of action. Thenight is spent in this jolly pastime. Before his departure in the morning, the King invites his reverend host to Court, promises, at least,to requite his hospitality, and expresses himself much pleased with his entertainment. The jolly Hermit at length agrees to venturethither, and to enquire for Jack Fletcher, which is the name assumed by the King. After the Hermit has shown Edward some feats ofarchery, the joyous pair separate. The King rides home, and rejoins his retinue. As the romance is imperfect, we are not acquaintedhow the discovery takes place; but it is probably much in the same manner as in other narratives turning on the same subject, wherethe host, apprehensive of death for having trespassed on the respect due to his Sovereign, while incognito, is agreeably surprised byreceiving honours and reward.In Mr Hartshorne’s collection, there is a romance on the same foundation, called King Edward and the Shepherd,4 which,considered as illustrating manners, is still more curious than the King and the Hermit; but it is foreign to the present purpose. Thereader has here the original legend from which the incident in the romance is derived; and the identifying the irregular Eremite withthe Friar Tuck of Robin Hood’s story, was an obvious expedient.The name of Ivanhoe was suggested by an old rhyme. All novelists have had occasion at some time or other to wish with Falstaff,that they knew where a commodity of good names was to be had. On such an occasion the author chanced to call to memory a rhymerecording three names of the manors forfeited by the ancestor of the celebrated Hampden, for striking the Black Prince a blow with hisracket, when they quarrelled at tennis:“Tring, Wing, and Ivanhoe,For striking of a blow,Hampden did forego,And glad he could escape so.”The word suited the author’s purpose in two material respects,—for, ﬁrst, it had an ancient English sound; and secondly, it conveyedno indication whatever of the nature of the story. He presumes to hold this last quality to be of no small importance. What is called ataking title, serves the direct interest of the bookseller or publisher, who by this means sometimes sells an edition while it is yetpassing the press. But if the author permits an over degree of attention to be drawn to his work ere it has appeared, he places himself inthe embarrassing condition of having excited a degree of expectation which, if he proves unable to satisfy, is an error fatal to hisliterary reputation. Besides, when we meet such a title as the Gunpowder Plot, or any other connected with general history, eachreader, before he has seen the book, has formed to himself some particular idea of the sort of manner in which the story is to beconducted, and the nature of the amusement which he is to derive from it. In this he is probably disappointed, and in that case may benaturally disposed to visit upon the author or the work, the unpleasant feelings thus excited. In such a case the literary adventurer iscensured, not for having missed the mark at which he himself aimed, but for not having shot off his shaft in a direction he neverthought of.On the footing of unreserved communication which the Author has established with the reader, he may here add the triﬂingcircumstance, that a roll of Norman warriors, occurring in the Auchinleck Manuscript, gave him the formidable name of Front-de-Bœuf.Ivanhoe was highly successful upon its appearance, and may be said to have procured for its author the freedom of the Rules, sincehe has ever since been permitted to exercise his powers of ﬁctitious composition in England, as well as Scotland.The character of the fair Jewess found so much favour in the eyes of some fair readers, that the writer was censured, because, whenarranging the fates of the characters of the drama, he had not assigned the hand of Wilfred to Rebecca, rather than the less interestingRowena. But, not to mention that the prejudices of the age rendered such an union almost impossible, the author may, in passing,observe, that he thinks a character of a highly virtuous and lofty stamp, is degraded rather than exalted by an attempt to reward virtuewith temporal prosperity. Such is not the recompense which Providence has deemed worthy of suffering merit, and it is a dangerousand fatal doctrine to teach young persons, the most common readers of romance, that rectitude of conduct and of principle are eithernaturally allied with, or adequately rewarded by, the gratiﬁcation of our passions, or attainment of our wishes. In a word, if a virtuousand self-denied character is dismissed with temporal wealth, greatness, rank, or the indulgence of such a rashly formed or ill assortedpassion as that of Rebecca for Ivanhoe, the reader will be apt to say, verily Virtue has had its reward. But a glance on the great pictureof life will show, that the duties of self-denial, and the sacriﬁce of passion to principle, are seldom thus remunerated; and that theinternal consciousness of their high-minded discharge of duty, produces on their own reﬂections a more adequate recompense, in theform of that peace which the world cannot give or take away.Abbotsford, 1st September, 1830.DEDICATORY EPISTLETOTHE REV . DR DRYASDUST, F.A.S.Residing in the Castle-Gate, York.Much esteemed and dear Sir,It is scarcely necessary to mention the various and concurring reasons which induce me to place your name at the head of thefollowing work. Yet the chief of these reasons may perhaps be refuted by the imperfections of the performance. Could I have hoped torender it worthy of your patronage, the public would at once have seen the propriety of inscribing a work designed to illustrate thedomestic antiquities of England, and particularly of our Saxon forefathers, to the learned author of the Essays upon the Horn of KingUlphus, and on the Lands bestowed by him upon the patrimony of St Peter. I am conscious, however, that the slight, unsatisfactory,and trivial manner, in which the result of my antiquarian researches has been recorded in the following pages, takes the work fromunder that class which bears the proud motto, “Detur digniori”. On the contrary, I fear I shall incur the censure of presumption inplacing the venerable name of Dr Jonas Dryasdust at the head of a publication, which the more grave antiquary will perhaps class withthe idle novels and romances of the day. I am anxious to vindicate myself from such a charge; for although I might trust to yourfriendship for an apology in your eyes, yet I would not willingly stand conviction in those of the public of so grave a crime, as myfears lead me to anticipate my being charged with.I must therefore remind you, that when we ﬁrst talked over together that class of productions, in one of which the private and familyaffairs of your learned northern friend, Mr Oldbuck of Monkbarns, were so unjustiﬁably exposed to the public, some discussionoccurred between us concerning the cause of the popularity these works have attained in this idle age, which, whatever other meritthey possess, must be admitted to be hastily written, and in violation of every rule assigned to the epopeia. It seemed then to be youropinion, that the charm lay entirely in the art with which the unknown author had availed himself, like a second M’Pherson, of theantiquarian stores which lay scattered around him, supplying his own indolence or poverty of invention, by the incidents which hadactually taken place in his country at no distant period, by introducing real characters, and scarcely suppressing real names. It was notabove sixty or seventy years, you observed, since the whole north of Scotland was under a state of government nearly as simple and aspatriarchal as those of our good allies the Mohawks and Iroquois. Admitting that the author cannot himself be supposed to havewitnessed those times, he must have lived, you observed, among persons who had acted and suffered in them; and even within thesethirty years, such an inﬁnite change has taken place in the manners of Scotland, that men look back upon the habits of society properto their immediate ancestors, as we do on those of the reign of Queen Anne, or even the period of the Revolution. Having thusmaterials of every kind lying strewed around him, there was little, you observed, to embarrass the author, but the difﬁculty of choice.It was no wonder, therefore, that, having begun to work a mine so plentiful, he should have derived from his works fully more creditand proﬁt than the facility of his labours merited.Admitting (as I could not deny) the general truth of these conclusions, I cannot but think it strange that no attempt has been made toexcite an interest for the traditions and manners of Old England, similiar to that which has been obtained in behalf of those of ourpoorer and less celebrated neighbours. The Kendal green, though its date is more ancient, ought surely to be as dear to our feelings, asthe variegated tartans of the north. The name of Robin Hood, if duly conjured with, should raise a spirit as soon as that of Rob Roy;and the patriots of England deserve no less their renown in our modern circles, than the Bruces and Wallaces of Caledonia. If thescenery of the south be less romantic and sublime than that of the northern mountains, it must be allowed to possess in the sameproportion superior softness and beauty; and upon the whole, we feel ourselves entitled to exclaim with the patriotic Syrian—“Are notPharphar and Abana, rivers of Damascus, better than all the rivers of Israel?”Your objections to such an attempt, my dear Doctor, were, you may remember, two-fold. You insisted upon the advantages whichthe Scotsman possessed, from the very recent existence of that state of society in which his scene was to be laid. Many now alive, youremarked, well remembered persons who had not only seen the celebrated Roy M’Gregor, but had feasted, and even fought with him.All those minute circumstances belonging to private life and domestic character, all that gives verisimilitude to a narrative, andindividuality to the persons introduced, is still known and remembered in Scotland; whereas in England, civilisation has been so longcomplete, that our ideas of our ancestors are only to be gleaned from musty records and chronicles, the authors of which seemperversely to have conspired to suppress in their narratives all interesting details, in order to ﬁnd room for ﬂowers of monkisheloquence, or trite reﬂections upon morals. To match an English and a Scottish author in the rival task of embodying and reviving thetraditions of their respective countries, would be, you alleged, in the highest degree unequal and unjust. The Scottish magician, yousaid, was, like Lucan’s witch, at liberty to walk over the recent ﬁeld of battle, and to select for the subject of resuscitation by hissorceries, a body whose limbs had recently quivered with existence, and whose throat had but just uttered the last note of agony. Sucha subject even the powerful Erictho was compelled to select, as alone capable of being reanimated even by “her” potent magic———gelidas leto scrutata medullas,Pulmonis rigidi stantes sine vulnere ﬁbrasInvenit, et vocem defuncto in corpore quaerit.The English author, on the other hand, without supposing him less of a conjuror than the Northern Warlock, can, you observed, onlyhave the liberty of selecting his subject amidst the dust of antiquity, where nothing was to be found but dry, sapless, mouldering, anddisjointed bones, such as those which ﬁlled the valley of Jehoshaphat. You expressed, besides, your apprehension, that the unpatrioticprejudices of my countrymen would not allow fair play to such a work as that of which I endeavoured to demonstrate the probablesuccess. And this, you said, was not entirely owing to the more general prejudice in favour of that which is foreign, but that it restedpartly upon improbabilities, arising out of the circumstances in which the English reader is placed. If you describe to him a set of wildmanners, and a state of primitive society existing in the Highlands of Scotland, he is much disposed to acquiesce in the truth of what isasserted. And reason good. If he be of the ordinary class of readers, he has either never seen those remote districts at all, or he haswandered through those desolate regions in the course of a summer tour, eating bad dinners, sleeping on truckle beds, stalking fromdesolation to desolation, and fully prepared to believe the strangest things that could be told him of a people, wild and extravagantenough to be attached to scenery so extraordinary. But the same worthy person, when placed in his own snug parlour, and surroundedby all the comforts of an Englishman’s ﬁreside, is not half so much disposed to believe that his own ancestors led a very different lifefrom himself; that the shattered tower, which now forms a vista from his window, once held a baron who would have hung him up athis own door without any form of trial; that the hinds, by whom his little pet-farm is managed, a few centuries ago would have beenhis slaves; and that the complete inﬂuence of feudal tyranny once extended over the neighbouring village, where the attorney is now aman of more importance than the lord of the manor.While I own the force of these objections, I must confess, at the same time, that they do not appear to me to be altogetherinsurmountable. The scantiness of materials is indeed a formidable difﬁculty; but no one knows better than Dr Dryasdust, that to thosedeeply read in antiquity, hints concerning the private life of our ancestors lie scattered through the pages of our various historians,bearing, indeed, a slender proportion to the other matters of which they treat, but still, when collected together, sufﬁcient to throwconsiderable light upon the vie privée of our forefathers; indeed, I am convinced, that however I myself may fail in the ensuingattempt, yet, with more labour in collecting, or more skill in using, the materials within his reach, illustrated as they have been by thelabours of Dr Henry, of the late Mr Strutt, and, above all, of Mr Sharon Turner, an abler hand would have been successful; andtherefore I protest, beforehand, against any argument which may be founded on the failure of the present experiment.On the other hand, I have already said, that if any thing like a true picture of old English manners could be drawn, I would trust tothe good-nature and good sense of my countrymen for insuring its favourable reception.Having thus replied, to the best of my power, to the ﬁrst class of your objections, or at least having shown my resolution to overleapthe barriers which your prudence has raised, I will be brief in noticing that which is more peculiar to myself. It seems to be youropinion, that the very ofﬁce of an antiquary, employed in grave, and, as the vulgar will sometimes allege, in toilsome and minuteresearch, must be considered as incapacitating him from successfully compounding a tale of this sort. But permit me to say, my dearDoctor, that this objection is rather formal than substantial. It is true, that such slight compositions might not suit the severer genius ofour friend Mr Oldbuck. Yet Horace Walpole wrote a goblin tale which has thrilled through many a bosom; and George Ellis couldtransfer all the playful fascination of a humour, as delightful as it was uncommon, into his Abridgement of the Ancient MetricalRomances. So that, however I may have occasion to rue my present audacity, I have at least the most respectable precedents in myfavour.Still the severer antiquary may think, that, by thus intermingling ﬁction with truth, I am polluting the well of history with moderninventions, and impressing upon the rising generation false ideas of the age which I describe. I cannot but in some sense admit theforce of this reasoning, which I yet hope to traverse by the following considerations.It is true, that I neither can, nor do pretend, to the observation of complete accuracy, even in matters of outward costume, much lessin the more important points of language and manners. But the same motive which prevents my writing the dialogue of the piece inAnglo-Saxon or in Norman-French, and which prohibits my sending forth to the public this essay printed with the types of Caxton orWynken de Worde, prevents my attempting to conﬁne myself within the limits of the period in which my story is laid. It is necessary,for exciting interest of any kind, that the subject assumed should be, as it were, translated into the manners, as well as the language, ofthe age we live in. No fascination has ever been attached to Oriental literature, equal to that produced by Mr Galland’s ﬁrst translationof the Arabian Tales; in which, retaining on the one hand the splendour of Eastern costume, and on the other the wildness of Easternﬁction, he mixed these with just so much ordinary feeling and expression, as rendered them interesting and intelligible, while heabridged the long-winded narratives, curtailed the monotonous reﬂections, and rejected the endless repetitions of the Arabian original.The tales, therefore, though less purely Oriental than in their ﬁrst concoction, were eminently better ﬁtted for the European market,and obtained an unrivalled degree of public favour, which they certainly would never have gained had not the manners and style beenin some degree familiarized to the feelings and habits of the western reader.In point of justice, therefore, to the multitudes who will, I trust, devour this book with avidity, I have so far explained our ancientmanners in modern language, and so far detailed the characters and sentiments of my persons, that the modern reader will not ﬁndhimself, I should hope, much trammelled by the repulsive dryness of mere antiquity. In this, I respectfully contend, I have in norespect exceeded the fair license due to the author of a ﬁctitious composition. The late ingenious Mr Strutt, in his romance of Queen-Hoo-Hall, 5 acted upon another principle; and in distinguishing between what was ancient and modern, forgot, as it appears to me, thatextensive neutral ground, the large proportion, that is, of manners and sentiments which are common to us and to our ancestors, havingbeen handed down unaltered from them to us, or which, arising out of the principles of our common nature, must have existed alike ineither state of society. In this manner, a man of talent, and of great antiquarian erudition, limited the popularity of his work, byexcluding from it every thing which was not sufﬁciently obsolete to be altogether forgotten and unintelligible.The license which I would here vindicate, is so necessary to the execution of my plan, that I will crave your patience while Iillustrate my argument a little farther.He who ﬁrst opens Chaucer, or any other ancient poet, is so much struck with the obsolete spelling, multiplied consonants, andantiquated appearance of the language, that he is apt to lay the work down in despair, as encrusted too deep with the rust of antiquity,to permit his judging of its merits or tasting its beauties. But if some intelligent and accomplished friend points out to him, that thedifﬁculties by which he is startled are more in appearance than reality, if, by reading aloud to him, or by reducing the ordinary wordsto the modern orthography, he satisﬁes his proselyte that only about one-tenth part of the words employed are in fact obsolete, thenovice may be easily persuaded to approach the “well of English undeﬁled,” with the certainty that a slender degree of patience willenable him to to enjoy both the humour and the pathos with which old Geoffrey delighted the age of Cressy and of Poictiers.To pursue this a little farther. If our neophyte, strong in the new-born love of antiquity, were to undertake to imitate what he hadlearnt to admire, it must be allowed he would act very injudiciously, if he were to select from the Glossary the obsolete words which itcontains, and employ those exclusively of all phrases and vocables retained in modern days. This was the error of the unfortunateChatterton. In order to give his language the appearance of antiquity, he rejected every word that was modern, and produced a dialectentirely different from any that had ever been spoken in Great Britain. He who would imitate an ancient language with success, mustattend rather to its grammatical character, turn of expression, and mode of arrangement, than labour to collect extraordinary andantiquated terms, which, as I have already averred, do not in ancient authors approach the number of words still in use, though perhapssomewhat altered in sense and spelling, in the proportion of one to ten.What I have applied to language, is still more justly applicable to sentiments and manners. The passions, the sources from whichthese must spring in all their modiﬁcations, are generally the same in all ranks and conditions, all countries and ages; and it follows, asa matter of course, that the opinions, habits of thinking, and actions, however inﬂuenced by the peculiar state of society, must still,upon the whole, bear a strong resemblance to each other. Our ancestors were not more distinct from us, surely, than Jews are fromChristians; they had “eyes, hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions;” were “fed with the same food, hurt with the sameweapons, subject to the same diseases, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer,” as ourselves. The tenor, therefore, oftheir affections and feelings, must have borne the same general proportion to our own.It follows, therefore, that of the materials which an author has to use in a romance, or ﬁctitious composition, such as I have venturedto attempt, he will ﬁnd that a great proportion, both of language and manners, is as proper to the present time as to those in which hehas laid his time of action. The freedom of choice which this allows him, is therefore much greater, and the difﬁculty of his task muchmore diminished, than at ﬁrst appears. To take an illustration from a sister art, the antiquarian details may be said to represent thepeculiar features of a landscape under delineation of the pencil. His feudal tower must arise in due majesty; the ﬁgures which heintroduces must have the costume and character of their age; the piece must represent the peculiar features of the scene which he haschosen for his subject, with all its appropriate elevation of rock, or precipitate descent of cataract. His general colouring, too, must becopied from Nature: The sky must be clouded or serene, according to the climate, and the general tints must be those which prevail ina natural landscape. So far the painter is bound down by the rules of his art, to a precise imitation of the features of Nature; but it is notrequired that he should descend to copy all her more minute features, or represent with absolute exactness the very herbs, ﬂowers, andtrees, with which the spot is decorated. These, as well as all the more minute points of light and shadow, are attributes proper toscenery in general, natural to each situation, and subject to the artist’s disposal, as his taste or pleasure may dictate.It is true, that this license is conﬁned in either case within legitimate bounds. The painter must introduce no ornament inconsistentwith the climate or country of his landscape; he must not plant cypress trees upon Inch-Merrin, or Scottish ﬁrs among the ruins ofPersepolis; and the author lies under a corresponding restraint. However far he may venture in a more full detail of passions andfeelings, than is to be found in the ancient compositions which he imitates, he must introduce nothing inconsistent with the manners ofthe age; his knights, squires, grooms, and yeomen, may be more fully drawn than in the hard, dry delineations of an ancientilluminated manuscript, but the character and costume of the age must remain inviolate; they must be the same ﬁgures, drawn by abetter pencil, or, to speak more modestly, executed in an age when the principles of art were better understood. His language must notbe exclusively obsolete and unintelligible; but he should admit, if possible, no word or turn of phraseology betraying an origin directlymodern. It is one thing to make use of the language and sentiments which are common to ourselves and our forefathers, and it isanother to invest them with the sentiments and dialect exclusively proper to their descendants.This, my dear friend, I have found the most difﬁcult part of my task; and, to speak frankly, I hardly expect to satisfy your less partialjudgment, and more extensive knowledge of such subjects, since I have hardly been able to please my own.I am conscious that I shall be found still more faulty in the tone of keeping and costume, by those who may be disposed rigidly toexamine my Tale, with reference to the manners of the exact period in which my actors ﬂourished: It may be, that I have introducedlittle which can positively be termed modern; but, on the other hand, it is extremely probable that I may have confused the manners oftwo or three centuries, and introduced, during the reign of Richard the First, circumstances appropriated to a period either considerablyearlier, or a good deal later than that era. It is my comfort, that errors of this kind will escape the general class of readers, and that Imay share in the ill-deserved applause of those architects, who, in their modern Gothic, do not hesitate to introduce, without rule ormethod, ornaments proper to different styles and to different periods of the art. Those whose extensive researches have given them themeans of judging my backslidings with more severity, will probably be lenient in proportion to their knowledge of the difﬁculty of mytask. My honest and neglected friend, Ingulphus, has furnished me with many a valuable hint; but the light afforded by the Monk ofCroydon, and Geoffrey de Vinsauff, is dimmed by such a conglomeration of uninteresting and unintelligible matter, that we gladly ﬂyfor relief to the delightful pages of the gallant Froissart, although he ﬂourished at a period so much more remote from the date of myhistory. If, therefore, my dear friend, you have generosity enough to pardon the presumptuous attempt, to frame for myself a minstrelcoronet, partly out of the pearls of pure antiquity, and partly from the Bristol stones and paste, with which I have endeavoured toimitate them, I am convinced your opinion of the difﬁculty of the task will reconcile you to the imperfect manner of its execution.Of my materials I have but little to say. They may be chieﬂy found in the singular Anglo-Norman MS., which Sir Arthur Wardourpreserves with such jealous care in the third drawer of his oaken cabinet, scarcely allowing any one to touch it, and being himself notable to read one syllable of its contents. I should never have got his consent, on my visit to Scotland, to read in those precious pagesfor so many hours, had I not promised to designate it by some emphatic mode of printing, as {The Wardour Manuscript}; giving it,thereby, an individuality as important as the Bannatyne MS., the Auchinleck MS., and any other monument of the patience of a Gothicscrivener. I have sent, for your private consideration, a list of the contents of this curious piece, which I shall perhaps subjoin, withyour approbation, to the third volume of my Tale, in case the printer’s devil should continue impatient for copy, when the whole of mynarrative has been imposed.Adieu, my dear friend; I have said enough to explain, if not to vindicate, the attempt which I have made, and which, in spite of yourdoubts, and my own incapacity, I am still willing to believe has not been altogether made in vain.I hope you are now well recovered from your spring ﬁt of the gout, and shall be happy if the advice of your learned physicianshould recommend a tour to these parts. Several curiosities have been lately dug up near the wall, as well as at the ancient station ofHabitancum. Talking of the latter, I suppose you have long since heard the news, that a sulky churlish boor has destroyed the ancientstatue, or rather bas-relief, popularly called Robin of Redesdale. It seems Robin’s fame attracted more visitants than was consistentwith the growth of the heather, upon a moor worth a shilling an acre. Reverend as you write yourself, be revengeful for once, and praywith me that he may be visited with such a ﬁt of the stone, as if he had all the fragments of poor Robin in that region of his viscerawhere the disease holds its seat. Tell this not in Gath, lest the Scots rejoice that they have at length found a parallel instance amongtheir neighbours, to that barbarous deed which demolished Arthur’s Oven. But there is no end to lamentation, when we betakeourselves to such subjects. My respectful compliments attend Miss Dryasdust; I endeavoured to match the spectacles agreeable to hercommission, during my late journey to London, and hope she has received them safe, and found them satisfactory. I send this by theblind carrier, so that probably it may be some time upon its journey. 6The last news which I hear from Edinburgh is, that the gentleman who ﬁlls the situation of Secretary to the Society of Antiquariesof Scotland, 7 is the best amateur draftsman in that kingdom, and that much is expected from his skill and zeal in delineating thosespecimens of national antiquity, which are either mouldering under the slow touch of time, or swept away by modern taste, with thesame besom of destruction which John Knox used at the Reformation. Once more adieu; “vale tandem, non immemor mei”. Believeme to be,Reverend, and very dear Sir,Your most faithful humble Servant.Laurence Templeton.Toppingwold, near Egremont, Cumberland, Nov. 17, 1817.IV ANHOE.CHAPTER IThus communed these; while to their lowly dome,The full-fed swine return’d with evening home;Compell’d, reluctant, to the several sties,With din obstreperous, and ungrateful cries.POPE’S ODYSSEYIn that pleasant district of merry England which is watered by the river Don, there extended in ancient times a large forest, coveringthe greater part of the beautiful hills and valleys which lie between Shefﬁeld and the pleasant town of Doncaster. The remains of thisextensive wood are still to be seen at the noble seats of Wentworth, of Warncliffe Park, and around Rotherham. Here haunted of yorethe fabulous Dragon of Wantley; here were fought many of the most desperate battles during the Civil Wars of the Roses; and herealso ﬂourished in ancient times those bands of gallant outlaws, whose deeds have been rendered so popular in English song.Such being our chief scene, the date of our story refers to a period towards the end of the reign of Richard I., when his return fromhis long captivity had become an event rather wished than hoped for by his despairing subjects, who were in the meantime subjectedto every species of subordinate oppression. The nobles, whose power had become exorbitant during the reign of Stephen, and whomthe prudence of Henry the Second had scarce reduced to some degree of subjection to the crown, had now resumed their ancientlicense in its utmost extent; despising the feeble interference of the English Council of State, fortifying their castles, increasing thenumber of their dependants, reducing all around them to a state of vassalage, and striving by every means in their power, to placethemselves each at the head of such forces as might enable him to make a ﬁgure in the national convulsions which appeared to beimpending.The situation of the inferior gentry, or Franklins, as they were called, who, by the law and spirit of the English constitution, wereentitled to hold themselves independent of feudal tyranny, became now unusually precarious. If, as was most generally the case, theyplaced themselves under the protection of any of the petty kings in their vicinity, accepted of feudal ofﬁces in his household, or boundthemselves by mutual treaties of alliance and protection, to support him in his enterprises, they might indeed purchase temporaryrepose; but it must be with the sacriﬁce of that independence which was so dear to every English bosom, and at the certain hazard ofbeing involved as a party in whatever rash expedition the ambition of their protector might lead him to undertake. On the other hand,such and so multiplied were the means of vexation and oppression possessed by the great Barons, that they never wanted the pretext,and seldom the will, to harass and pursue, even to the very edge of destruction, any of their less powerful neighbours, who attemptedto separate themselves from their authority, and to trust for their protection, during the dangers of the times, to their own inoffensiveconduct, and to the laws of the land.A circumstance which greatly tended to enhance the tyranny of the nobility, and the sufferings of the inferior classes, arose from theconsequences of the Conquest by Duke William of Normandy. Four generations had not sufﬁced to blend the hostile blood of theNormans and Anglo-Saxons, or to unite, by common language and mutual interests, two hostile races, one of which still felt theelation of triumph, while the other groaned under all the consequences of defeat. The power had been completely placed in the handsof the Norman nobility, by the event of the battle of Hastings, and it had been used, as our histories assure us, with no moderate hand.The whole race of Saxon princes and nobles had been extirpated or disinherited, with few or no exceptions; nor were the numbersgreat who possessed land in the country of their fathers, even as proprietors of the second, or of yet inferior classes. The royal policyhad long been to weaken, by every means, legal or illegal, the strength of a part of the population which was justly considered asnourishing the most inveterate antipathy to their victor. All the monarchs of the Norman race had shown the most marked predilectionfor their Norman subjects; the laws of the chase, and many others equally unknown to the milder and more free spirit of the Saxonconstitution, had been ﬁxed upon the necks of the subjugated inhabitants, to add weight, as it were, to the feudal chains with whichthey were loaded. At court, and in the castles of the great nobles, where the pomp and state of a court was emulated, Norman-Frenchwas the only language employed; in courts of law, the pleadings and judgments were delivered in the same tongue. In short, Frenchwas the language of honour, of chivalry, and even of justice, while the far more manly and expressive Anglo-Saxon was abandoned tothe use of rustics and hinds, who knew no other. Still, however, the necessary intercourse between the lords of the soil, and thoseoppressed inferior beings by whom that soil was cultivated, occasioned the gradual formation of a dialect, compounded betwixt theFrench and the Anglo-Saxon, in which they could render themselves mutually intelligible to each other; and from this necessity aroseby degrees the structure of our present English language, in which the speech of the victors and the vanquished have been so happilyblended together; and which has since been so richly improved by importations from the classical languages, and from those spokenby the southern nations of Europe.This state of things I have thought it necessary to premise for the information of the general reader, who might be apt to forget, that,although no great historical events, such as war or insurrection, mark the existence of the Anglo-Saxons as a separate peoplesubsequent to the reign of William the Second; yet the great national distinctions betwixt them and their conquerors, the recollectionof what they had formerly been, and to what they were now reduced, continued down to the reign of Edward the Third, to keep openthe wounds which the Conquest had inﬂicted, and to maintain a line of separation betwixt the descendants of the victor Normans andthe vanquished Saxons.The sun was setting upon one of the rich grassy glades of that forest, which we have mentioned in the beginning of the chapter.Hundreds of broad-headed, short-stemmed, wide-branched oaks, which had witnessed perhaps the stately march of the Romansoldiery, ﬂung their gnarled arms over a thick carpet of the most delicious green sward; in some places they were intermingled withbeeches, hollies, and copsewood of various descriptions, so closely as totally to intercept the level beams of the sinking sun; in othersthey receded from each other, forming those long sweeping vistas, in the intricacy of which the eye delights to lose itself, whileimagination considers them as the paths to yet wilder scenes of silvan solitude. Here the red rays of the sun shot a broken anddiscoloured light, that partially hung upon the shattered boughs and mossy trunks of the trees, and there they illuminated in brilliantpatches the portions of turf to which they made their way. A considerable open space, in the midst of this glade, seemed formerly tohave been dedicated to the rites of Druidical superstition; for, on the summit of a hillock, so regular as to seem artiﬁcial, there stillremained part of a circle of rough unhewn stones, of large dimensions. Seven stood upright; the rest had been dislodged from theirplaces, probably by the zeal of some convert to Christianity, and lay, some prostrate near their former site, and others on the side of thehill. One large stone only had found its way to the bottom, and in stopping the course of a small brook, which glided smoothly roundthe foot of the eminence, gave, by its opposition, a feeble voice of murmur to the placid and elsewhere silent streamlet.The human ﬁgures which completed this landscape, were in number two, partaking, in their dress and appearance, of that wild andrustic character, which belonged to the woodlands of the West-Riding of Yorkshire at that early period. The eldest of these men had astern, savage, and wild aspect. His garment was of the simplest form imaginable, being a close jacket with sleeves, composed of thetanned skin of some animal, on which the hair had been originally left, but which had been worn off in so many places, that it wouldhave been difﬁcult to distinguish from the patches that remained, to what creature the fur had belonged. This primeval vestmentreached from the throat to the knees, and served at once all the usual purposes of body-clothing; there was no wider opening at thecollar, than was necessary to admit the passage of the head, from which it may be inferred, that it was put on by slipping it over thehead and shoulders, in the manner of a modern shirt, or ancient hauberk. Sandals, bound with thongs made of boars’ hide, protectedthe feet, and a roll of thin leather was twined artiﬁcially round the legs, and, ascending above the calf, left the knees bare, like those ofa Scottish Highlander. To make the jacket sit yet more close to the body, it was gathered at the middle by a broad leathern belt, securedby a brass buckle; to one side of which was attached a sort of scrip, and to the other a ram’s horn, accoutred with a mouthpiece, for thepurpose of blowing. In the same belt was stuck one of those long, broad, sharp-pointed, and two-edged knives, with a buck’s-hornhandle, which were fabricated in the neighbourhood, and bore even at this early period the name of a Shefﬁeld whittle. The man hadno covering upon his head, which was only defended by his own thick hair, matted and twisted together, and scorched by the inﬂuenceof the sun into a rusty dark-red colour, forming a contrast with the overgrown beard upon his cheeks, which was rather of a yellow oramber hue. One part of his dress only remains, but it is too remarkable to be suppressed; it was a brass ring, resembling a dog’s collar,but without any opening, and soldered fast round his neck, so loose as to form no impediment to his breathing, yet so tight as to beincapable of being removed, excepting by the use of the ﬁle. On this singular gorget was engraved, in Saxon characters, an inscriptionof the following purport:—“Gurth, the son of Beowulph, is the born thrall of Cedric of Rotherwood.”Beside the swine-herd, for such was Gurth’s occupation, was seated, upon one of the fallen Druidical monuments, a person aboutten years younger in appearance, and whose dress, though resembling his companion’s in form, was of better materials, and of a morefantastic appearance. His jacket had been stained of a bright purple hue, upon which there had been some attempt to paint grotesqueornaments in different colours. To the jacket he added a short cloak, which scarcely reached half way down his thigh; it was ofcrimson cloth, though a good deal soiled, lined with bright yellow; and as he could transfer it from one shoulder to the other, or at hispleasure draw it all around him, its width, contrasted with its want of longitude, formed a fantastic piece of drapery. He had thin silverbracelets upon his arms, and on his neck a collar of the same metal bearing the inscription, “Wamba, the son of Witless, is the thrall ofCedric of Rotherwood.” This personage had the same sort of sandals with his companion, but instead of the roll of leather thong, hislegs were cased in a sort of gaiters, of which one was red and the other yellow. He was provided also with a cap, having around itmore than one bell, about the size of those attached to hawks, which jingled as he turned his head to one side or other; and as heseldom remained a minute in the same posture, the sound might be considered as incessant. Around the edge of this cap was a stiffbandeau of leather, cut at the top into open work, resembling a coronet, while a prolonged bag arose from within it, and fell down onone shoulder like an old-fashioned nightcap, or a jelly-bag, or the head-gear of a modern hussar. It was to this part of the cap that thebells were attached; which circumstance, as well as the shape of his head-dress, and his own half-crazed, half-cunning expression ofcountenance, sufﬁciently pointed him out as belonging to the race of domestic clowns or jesters, maintained in the houses of thewealthy, to help away the tedium of those lingering hours which they were obliged to spend within doors. He bore, like hiscompanion, a scrip, attached to his belt, but had neither horn nor knife, being probably considered as belonging to a class whom it isesteemed dangerous to intrust with edge-tools. In place of these, he was equipped with a sword of lath, resembling that with whichHarlequin operates his wonders upon the modern stage.The outward appearance of these two men formed scarce a stronger contrast than their look and demeanour. That of the serf, orbondsman, was sad and sullen; his aspect was bent on the ground with an appearance of deep dejection, which might be almostconstrued into apathy, had not the ﬁre which occasionally sparkled in his red eye manifested that there slumbered, under theappearance of sullen despondency, a sense of oppression, and a disposition to resistance. The looks of Wamba, on the other hand,indicated, as usual with his class, a sort of vacant curiosity, and ﬁdgetty impatience of any posture of repose, together with the utmostself-satisfaction respecting his own situation, and the appearance which he made. The dialogue which they maintained between them,was carried on in Anglo-Saxon, which, as we said before, was universally spoken by the inferior classes, excepting the Normansoldiers, and the immediate personal dependants of the great feudal nobles. But to give their conversation in the original would conveybut little information to the modern reader, for whose beneﬁt we beg to offer the following translation:“The curse of St Withold upon these infernal porkers!” said the swine-herd, after blowing his horn obstreperously, to collecttogether the scattered herd of swine, which, answering his call with notes equally melodious, made, however, no haste to removethemselves from the luxurious banquet of beech-mast and acorns on which they had fattened, or to forsake the marshy banks of therivulet, where several of them, half plunged in mud, lay stretched at their ease, altogether regardless of the voice of their keeper. “Thecurse of St Withold upon them and upon me!” said Gurth; “if the two-legged wolf snap not up some of them ere nightfall, I am no trueman. Here, Fangs! Fangs!” he ejaculated at the top of his voice to a ragged wolﬁsh-looking dog, a sort of lurcher, half mastiff, halfgreyhound, which ran limping about as if with the purpose of seconding his master in collecting the refractory grunters; but which, infact, from misapprehension of the swine-herd’s signals, ignorance of his own duty, or malice prepense, only drove them hither andthither, and increased the evil which he seemed to design to remedy. “A devil draw the teeth of him,” said Gurth, “and the mother ofmischief confound the Ranger of the forest, that cuts the foreclaws off our dogs, and makes them unﬁt for their trade! 8 Wamba, upand help me an thou be’st a man; take a turn round the back o’ the hill to gain the wind on them; and when thous’t got the weather-gage, thou mayst drive them before thee as gently as so many innocent lambs.”“Truly,” said Wamba, without stirring from the spot, “I have consulted my legs upon this matter, and they are altogether of opinion,that to carry my gay garments through these sloughs, would be an act of unfriendship to my sovereign person and royal wardrobe;that to carry my gay garments through these sloughs, would be an act of unfriendship to my sovereign person and royal wardrobe;wherefore, Gurth, I advise thee to call off Fangs, and leave the herd to their destiny, which, whether they meet with bands of travellingsoldiers, or of outlaws, or of wandering pilgrims, can be little else than to be converted into Normans before morning, to thy no smallease and comfort.”“The swine turned Normans to my comfort!” quoth Gurth; “expound that to me, Wamba, for my brain is too dull, and my mind toovexed, to read riddles.”“Why, how call you those grunting brutes running about on their four legs?” demanded Wamba.“Swine, fool, swine,” said the herd, “every fool knows that.”“And swine is good Saxon,” said the Jester; “but how call you the sow when she is ﬂayed, and drawn, and quartered, and hung upby the heels, like a traitor?”“Pork,” answered the swine-herd.“I am very glad every fool knows that too,” said Wamba, “and pork, I think, is good Norman-French; and so when the brute lives,and is in the charge of a Saxon slave, she goes by her Saxon name; but becomes a Norman, and is called pork, when she is carried tothe Castle-hall to feast among the nobles; what dost thou think of this, friend Gurth, ha?”“It is but too true doctrine, friend Wamba, however it got into thy fool’s pate.”“Nay, I can tell you more,” said Wamba, in the same tone; “there is old Alderman Ox continues to hold his Saxon epithet, while heis under the charge of serfs and bondsmen such as thou, but becomes Beef, a ﬁery French gallant, when he arrives before theworshipful jaws that are destined to consume him. Mynheer Calf, too, becomes Monsieur de Veau in the like manner; he is Saxonwhen he requires tendance, and takes a Norman name when he becomes matter of enjoyment.”“By St Dunstan,” answered Gurth, “thou speakest but sad truths; little is left to us but the air we breathe, and that appears to havebeen reserved with much hesitation, solely for the purpose of enabling us to endure the tasks they lay upon our shoulders. The ﬁnestand the fattest is for their board; the loveliest is for their couch; the best and bravest supply their foreign masters with soldiers, andwhiten distant lands with their bones, leaving few here who have either will or the power to protect the unfortunate Saxon. God’sblessing on our master Cedric, he hath done the work of a man in standing in the gap; but Reginald Front-de-Bœuf is coming down tothis country in person, and we shall soon see how little Cedric’s trouble will avail him.—Here, here,” he exclaimed again, raising hisvoice, “So ho! so ho! well done, Fangs! thou hast them all before thee now, and bring’st them on bravely, lad.”“Gurth,” said the Jester, “I know thou thinkest me a fool, or thou wouldst not be so rash in putting thy head into my mouth. Oneword to Reginald Front-de-Bœuf, or Philip de Malvoisin, that thou hast spoken treason against the Norman,—and thou art but a cast-away swineherd,—thou wouldst waver on one of these trees as a terror to all evil speakers against dignities.”“Dog, thou wouldst not betray me,” said Gurth, “after having led me on to speak so much at disadvantage?”“Betray thee!” answered the Jester; “no, that were the trick of a wise man; a fool cannot half so well help himself—but soft, whomhave we here?” he said, listening to the trampling of several horses which became then audible.“Never mind whom,” answered Gurth, who had now got his herd before him, and, with the aid of Fangs, was driving them downone of the long dim vistas which we have endeavoured to describe.“Nay, but I must see the riders,” answered Wamba; “perhaps they are come from Fairy-land with a message from King Oberon.”“A murrain take thee,” rejoined the swine-herd; “wilt thou talk of such things, while a terrible storm of thunder and lightning israging within a few miles of us? Hark, how the thunder rumbles! and for summer rain, I never saw such broad downright ﬂat drops fallout of the clouds; the oaks, too, notwithstanding the calm weather, sob and creak with their great boughs as if announcing a tempest.Thou canst play the rational if thou wilt; credit me for once, and let us home ere the storm begins to rage, for the night will be fearful.”Wamba seemed to feel the force of this appeal, and accompanied his companion, who began his journey after catching up a longquarter-staff which lay upon the grass beside him. This second Eumaeus strode hastily down the forest glade, driving before him, withthe assistance of Fangs, the whole herd of his inharmonious charge.CHAPTER IIA Monk there was, a fayre for the maistrie,An outrider that loved venerie;A manly man, to be an Abbot able,Full many a daintie horse had he in stable:And whan he rode, men might his bridle hearGingeling in a whistling wind as clear,And eke as loud, as doth the chapell bell,There as this lord was keeper of the cell.CHAUCERNotwithstanding the occasional exhortation and chiding of his companion, the noise of the horsemen’s feet continuing to approach,Wamba could not be prevented from lingering occasionally on the road, upon every pretence which occurred; now catching from thehazel a cluster of half-ripe nuts, and now turning his head to leer after a cottage maiden who crossed their path. The horsemen,therefore, soon overtook them on the road.Their numbers amounted to ten men, of whom the two who rode foremost seemed to be persons of considerable importance, and theothers their attendants. It was not difﬁcult to ascertain the condition and character of one of these personages. He was obviously anecclesiastic of high rank; his dress was that of a Cistercian Monk, but composed of materials much ﬁner than those which the rule ofthat order admitted. His mantle and hood were of the best Flanders cloth, and fell in ample, and not ungraceful folds, around ahandsome, though somewhat corpulent person. His countenance bore as little the marks of self-denial, as his habit indicated contemptof worldly splendour. His features might have been called good, had there not lurked under the pent-house of his eye, that slyepicurean twinkle which indicates the cautious voluptuary. In other respects, his profession and situation had taught him a readycommand over his countenance, which he could contract at pleasure into solemnity, although its natural expression was that of good-humoured social indulgence. In deﬁance of conventual rules, and the edicts of popes and councils, the sleeves of this dignitary werelined and turned up with rich furs, his mantle secured at the throat with a golden clasp, and the whole dress proper to his order as muchreﬁned upon and ornamented, as that of a quaker beauty of the present day, who, while she retains the garb and costume of her sectcontinues to give to its simplicity, by the choice of materials and the mode of disposing them, a certain air of coquettish attraction,savouring but too much of the vanities of the world.This worthy churchman rode upon a well-fed ambling mule, whose furniture was highly decorated, and whose bridle, according tothe fashion of the day, was ornamented with silver bells. In his seat he had nothing of the awkwardness of the convent, but displayedthe easy and habitual grace of a well-trained horseman. Indeed, it seemed that so humble a conveyance as a mule, in however goodcase, and however well broken to a pleasant and accommodating amble, was only used by the gallant monk for travelling on the road.A lay brother, one of those who followed in the train, had, for his use on other occasions, one of the most handsome Spanish jennetsever bred at Andalusia, which merchants used at that time to import, with great trouble and risk, for the use of persons of wealth anddistinction. The saddle and housings of this superb palfrey were covered by a long foot-cloth, which reached nearly to the ground, andon which were richly embroidered, mitres, crosses, and other ecclesiastical emblems. Another lay brother led a sumpter mule, loadedprobably with his superior’s baggage; and two monks of his own order, of inferior station, rode together in the rear, laughing andconversing with each other, without taking much notice of the other members of the cavalcade.The companion of the church dignitary was a man past forty, thin, strong, tall, and muscular; an athletic ﬁgure, which long fatigueand constant exercise seemed to have left none of the softer part of the human form, having reduced the whole to brawn, bones, andsinews, which had sustained a thousand toils, and were ready to dare a thousand more. His head was covered with a scarlet cap, facedwith fur—of that kind which the French call “mortier”, from its resemblance to the shape of an inverted mortar. His countenance wastherefore fully displayed, and its expression was calculated to impress a degree of awe, if not of fear, upon strangers. High features,naturally strong and powerfully expressive, had been burnt almost into Negro blackness by constant exposure to the tropical sun, andmight, in their ordinary state, be said to slumber after the storm of passion had passed away; but the projection of the veins of theforehead, the readiness with which the upper lip and its thick black moustaches quivered upon the slightest emotion, plainly intimatedthat the tempest might be again and easily awakened. His keen, piercing, dark eyes, told in every glance a history of difﬁcultiessubdued, and dangers dared, and seemed to challenge opposition to his wishes, for the pleasure of sweeping it from his road by adetermined exertion of courage and of will; a deep scar on his brow gave additional sternness to his countenance, and a sinisterexpression to one of his eyes, which had been slightly injured on the same occasion, and of which the vision, though perfect, was in aslight and partial degree distorted.The upper dress of this personage resembled that of his companion in shape, being a long monastic mantle; but the colour, beingscarlet, showed that he did not belong to any of the four regular orders of monks. On the right shoulder of the mantle there was cut, inwhite cloth, a cross of a peculiar form. This upper robe concealed what at ﬁrst view seemed rather inconsistent with its form, a shirt,namely, of linked mail, with sleeves and gloves of the same, curiously plaited and interwoven, as ﬂexible to the body as those whichare now wrought in the stocking-loom, out of less obdurate materials. The fore-part of his thighs, where the folds of his mantlepermitted them to be seen, were also covered with linked mail; the knees and feet were defended by splints, or thin plates of steel,ingeniously jointed upon each other; and mail hose, reaching from the ankle to the knee, effectually protected the legs, and completedthe rider’s defensive armour. In his girdle he wore a long and double-edged dagger, which was the only offensive weapon about hisperson.He rode, not a mule, like his companion, but a strong hackney for the road, to save his gallant war-horse, which a squire led behind,fully accoutred for battle, with a chamfron or plaited head-piece upon his head, having a short spike projecting from the front. On oneside of the saddle hung a short battle-axe, richly inlaid with Damascene carving; on the other the rider’s plumed head-piece and hoodof mail, with a long two-handed sword, used by the chivalry of the period. A second squire held aloft his master’s lance, from theextremity of which ﬂuttered a small banderole, or streamer, bearing a cross of the same form with that embroidered upon his cloak. Healso carried his small triangular shield, broad enough at the top to protect the breast, and from thence diminishing to a point. It wascovered with a scarlet cloth, which prevented the device from being seen.These two squires were followed by two attendants, whose dark visages, white turbans, and the Oriental form of their garments,showed them to be natives of some distant Eastern country. 9The whole appearance of this warrior and his retinue was wild and outlandish; the dress of his squires was gorgeous, and his Easternattendants wore silver collars round their throats, and bracelets of the same metal upon their swarthy arms and legs, of which theformer were naked from the elbow, and the latter from mid-leg to ankle. Silk and embroidery distinguished their dresses, and markedthe wealth and importance of their master; forming, at the same time, a striking contrast with the martial simplicity of his own attire.They were armed with crooked sabres, having the hilt and baldric inlaid with gold, and matched with Turkish daggers of yet morecostly workmanship. Each of them bore at his saddle-bow a bundle of darts or javelins, about four feet in length, having sharp steelheads, a weapon much in use among the Saracens, and of which the memory is yet preserved in the martial exercise called “El Jerrid”,still practised in the Eastern countries.The steeds of these attendants were in appearance as foreign as their riders. They were of Saracen origin, and consequently ofArabian descent; and their ﬁne slender limbs, small fetlocks, thin manes, and easy springy motion, formed a marked contrast with thelarge-jointed, heavy horses, of which the race was cultivated in Flanders and in Normandy, for mounting the men-at-arms of the periodin all the panoply of plate and mail; and which, placed by the side of those Eastern coursers, might have passed for a personiﬁcation ofsubstance and of shadow.The singular appearance of this cavalcade not only attracted the curiosity of Wamba, but excited even that of his less volatilecompanion. The monk he instantly knew to be the Prior of Jorvaulx Abbey, well known for many miles around as a lover of the chase,of the banquet, and, if fame did him not wrong, of other worldly pleasures still more inconsistent with his monastic vows.Yet so loose were the ideas of the times respecting the conduct of the clergy, whether secular or regular, that the Prior Aymermaintained a fair character in the neighbourhood of his abbey. His free and jovial temper, and the readiness with which he grantedabsolution from all ordinary delinquencies, rendered him a favourite among the nobility and principal gentry, to several of whom hewas allied by birth, being of a distinguished Norman family. The ladies, in particular, were not disposed to scan too nicely the moralsof a man who was a professed admirer of their sex, and who possessed many means of dispelling the ennui which was too apt tointrude upon the halls and bowers of an ancient feudal castle. The Prior mingled in the sports of the ﬁeld with more than dueeagerness, and was allowed to possess the best-trained hawks, and the ﬂeetest greyhounds in the North Riding; circumstances whichstrongly recommended him to the youthful gentry. With the old, he had another part to play, which, when needful, he could sustainwith great decorum. His knowledge of books, however superﬁcial, was sufﬁcient to impress upon their ignorance respect for hissupposed learning; and the gravity of his deportment and language, with the high tone which he exerted in setting forth the authorityof the church and of the priesthood, impressed them no less with an opinion of his sanctity. Even the common people, the severestcritics of the conduct of their betters, had commiseration with the follies of Prior Aymer. He was generous; and charity, as it is wellknown, covereth a multitude of sins, in another sense than that in which it is said to do so in Scripture. The revenues of the monastery,of which a large part was at his disposal, while they gave him the means of supplying his own very considerable expenses, affordedalso those largesses which he bestowed among the peasantry, and with which he frequently relieved the distresses of the oppressed. IfPrior Aymer rode hard in the chase, or remained long at the banquet,—if Prior Aymer was seen, at the early peep of dawn, to enter thepostern of the abbey, as he glided home from some rendezvous which had occupied the hours of darkness, men only shrugged up theirshoulders, and reconciled themselves to his irregularities, by recollecting that the same were practised by many of his brethren whohad no redeeming qualities whatsoever to atone for them. Prior Aymer, therefore, and his character, were well known to our Saxonserfs, who made their rude obeisance, and received his “benedicite, mes ﬁlz,” in return.But the singular appearance of his companion and his attendants, arrested their attention and excited their wonder, and they couldscarcely attend to the Prior of Jorvaulx’ question, when he demanded if they knew of any place of harbourage in the vicinity; so muchwere they surprised at the half monastic, half military appearance of the swarthy stranger, and at the uncouth dress and arms of hisEastern attendants. It is probable, too, that the language in which the benediction was conferred, and the information asked, soundedungracious, though not probably unintelligible, in the ears of the Saxon peasants.“I asked you, my children,” said the Prior, raising his voice, and using the lingua Franca, or mixed language, in which the Normanand Saxon races conversed with each other, “if there be in this neighbourhood any good man, who, for the love of God, and devotionto Mother Church, will give two of her humblest servants, with their train, a night’s hospitality and refreshment?”This he spoke with a tone of conscious importance, which formed a strong contrast to the modest terms which he thought it properto employ.“Two of the humblest servants of Mother Church!” repeated Wamba to himself,—but, fool as he was, taking care not to make hisobservation audible; “I should like to see her seneschals, her chief butlers, and other principal domestics!”After this internal commentary on the Prior’s speech, he raised his eyes, and replied to the question which had been put.“If the reverend fathers,” he said, “loved good cheer and soft lodging, few miles of riding would carry them to the Priory ofBrinxworth, where their quality could not but secure them the most honourable reception; or if they preferred spending a penitentialevening, they might turn down yonder wild glade, which would bring them to the hermitage of Copmanhurst, where a pious anchoretwould make them sharers for the night of the shelter of his roof and the beneﬁt of his prayers.”The Prior shook his head at both proposals.“Mine honest friend,” said he, “if the jangling of thy bells had not dizzied thine understanding, thou mightst know “Clericusclericum non decimat”; that is to say, we churchmen do not exhaust each other’s hospitality, but rather require that of the laity, givingthem thus an opportunity to serve God in honouring and relieving his appointed servants.”“It is true,” replied Wamba, “that I, being but an ass, am, nevertheless, honoured to hear the bells as well as your reverence’s mule;notwithstanding, I did conceive that the charity of Mother Church and her servants might be said, with other charity, to begin athome.”“A truce to thine insolence, fellow,” said the armed rider, breaking in on his prattle with a high and stern voice, “and tell us, if thoucanst, the road to—How call’d you your Franklin, Prior Aymer?”“Cedric,” answered the Prior; “Cedric the Saxon.—Tell me, good fellow, are we near his dwelling, and can you show us the road?”“The road will be uneasy to ﬁnd,” answered Gurth, who broke silence for the ﬁrst time, “and the family of Cedric retire early torest.”“Tush, tell not me, fellow,” said the military rider; “’tis easy for them to arise and supply the wants of travellers such as we are, whowill not stoop to beg the hospitality which we have a right to command.”“I know not,” said Gurth, sullenly, “if I should show the way to my master’s house, to those who demand as a right, the shelterwhich most are fain to ask as a favour.”“Do you dispute with me, slave!” said the soldier; and, setting spurs to his horse, he caused him make a demivolte across the path,raising at the same time the riding rod which he held in his hand, with a purpose of chastising what he considered as the insolence ofthe peasant.Gurth darted at him a savage and revengeful scowl, and with a ﬁerce, yet hesitating motion, laid his hand on the haft of his knife;but the interference of Prior Aymer, who pushed his mule betwixt his companion and the swineherd, prevented the meditated violence.“Nay, by St Mary, brother Brian, you must not think you are now in Palestine, predominating over heathen Turks and inﬁdelSaracens; we islanders love not blows, save those of holy Church, who chasteneth whom she loveth.—Tell me, good fellow,” said heto Wamba, and seconded his speech by a small piece of silver coin, “the way to Cedric the Saxon’s; you cannot be ignorant of it, and itis your duty to direct the wanderer even when his character is less sanctiﬁed than ours.”“In truth, venerable father,” answered the Jester, “the Saracen head of your right reverend companion has frightened out of mine theway home—I am not sure I shall get there to-night myself.”“Tush,” said the Abbot, “thou canst tell us if thou wilt. This reverend brother has been all his life engaged in ﬁghting among theSaracens for the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre; he is of the order of Knights Templars, whom you may have heard of; he is half amonk, half a soldier.”“If he is but half a monk,” said the Jester, “he should not be wholly unreasonable with those whom he meets upon the road, even ifthey should be in no hurry to answer questions that no way concern them.”“I forgive thy wit,” replied the Abbot, “on condition thou wilt show me the way to Cedric’s mansion.”“Well, then,” answered Wamba, “your reverences must hold on this path till you come to a sunken cross, of which scarce a cubit’slength remains above ground; then take the path to the left, for there are four which meet at Sunken Cross, and I trust your reverenceswill obtain shelter before the storm comes on.”
The Abbot thanked his sage adviser; and the cavalcade, setting spurs to their horses, rode on as men do who wish to reach their innbefore the bursting of a night-storm. As their horses’ hoofs died away, Gurth said to his companion, “If they follow thy wise direction,the reverend fathers will hardly reach Rotherwood this night.”“No,” said the Jester, grinning, “but they may reach Shefﬁeld if they have good luck, and that is as ﬁt a place for them. I am not sobad a woodsman as to show the dog where the deer lies, if I have no mind he should chase him.”“Thou art right,” said Gurth; “it were ill that Aymer saw the Lady Rowena; and it were worse, it may be, for Cedric to quarrel, as ismost likely he would, with this military monk. But, like good servants let us hear and see, and say nothing.”We return to the riders, who had soon left the bondsmen far behind them, and who maintained the following conversation in theNorman-French language, usually employed by the superior classes, with the exception of the few who were still inclined to boasttheir Saxon descent.“What mean these fellows by their capricious insolence?” said the Templar to the Benedictine, “and why did you prevent me fromchastising it?”“Marry, brother Brian,” replied the Prior, “touching the one of them, it were hard for me to render a reason for a fool speakingaccording to his folly; and the other churl is of that savage, ﬁerce, intractable race, some of whom, as I have often told you, are still tobe found among the descendants of the conquered Saxons, and whose supreme pleasure it is to testify, by all means in their power,their aversion to their conquerors.”“I would soon have beat him into courtesy,” observed Brian; “I am accustomed to deal with such spirits: Our Turkish captives are asﬁerce and intractable as Odin himself could have been; yet two months in my household, under the management of my master of theslaves, has made them humble, submissive, serviceable, and observant of your will. Marry, sir, you must be aware of the poison andthe dagger; for they use either with free will when you give them the slightest opportunity.”“Ay, but,” answered Prior Aymer, “every land has its own manners and fashions; and, besides that beating this fellow could procureus no information respecting the road to Cedric’s house, it would have been sure to have established a quarrel betwixt you and him hadwe found our way thither. Remember what I told you: this wealthy franklin is proud, ﬁerce, jealous, and irritable, a withstander of thenobility, and even of his neighbors, Reginald Front-de-Bœuf and Philip Malvoisin, who are no babies to strive with. He stands upsternly for the privileges of his race, and is so proud of his uninterrupted descend from Hereward, a renowned champion of theHeptarchy, that he is universally called Cedric the Saxon; and makes a boast of his belonging to a people from whom many othersendeaver to hide their descent, lest they should encounter a share of the ‘vae victis,’ or severities imposed upon the vanquished.”“Prior Aymer,” said the Templar, “you are a man of gallantry, learned in the study of beauty, and as expert as a troubadour in allmatters concerning the ‘arrets’ of love; but I shall expect much beauty in this celebrated Rowena to counterbalance the self-denial andforbearance which I must exert if I am to court the favor of such a seditious churl as you have described her father Cedric.”“Cedric is not her father,” replied the Prior, “and is but of remote relation: she is descended from higher blood than even he pretendsto, and is but distantly connected with him by birth. Her guardian, however, he is, self-constituted as I believe; but his ward is as dearto him as if she were his own child. Of her beauty you shall soon be judge; and if the purity of her complexion, and the majestic, yetsoft expression of a mild blue eye, do not chase from your memory the black-tressed girls of Palestine, ay, or the houris of oldMahound’s paradise, I am an inﬁdel, and no true son of the church.”“Should your boasted beauty,” said the Templar, “be weighed in the balance and found wanting, you know our wager?”“My gold collar,” answered the Prior, “against ten butts of Chian wine;—they are mine as securely as if they were already in theconvent vaults, under the key of old Dennis the cellarer.”“And I am myself to be judge,” said the Templar, “and am only to be convicted on my own admission, that I have seen no maidenso beautiful since Pentecost was a twelvemonth. Ran it not so?—Prior, your collar is in danger; I will wear it over my gorget in thelists of Ashby-de-la-Zouche.”“Win it fairly,” said the Prior, “and wear it as ye will; I will trust your giving true response, on your word as a knight and as achurchman. Yet, brother, take my advice, and ﬁle your tongue to a little more courtesy than your habits of predominating over inﬁdelcaptives and Eastern bondsmen have accustomed you. Cedric the Saxon, if offended,—and he is noway slack in taking offence,—is aman who, without respect to your knighthood, my high ofﬁce, or the sanctity of either, would clear his house of us, and send us tolodge with the larks, though the hour were midnight. And be careful how you look on Rowena, whom he cherishes with the mostjealous care; an he take the least alarm in that quarter we are but lost men. It is said he banished his only son from his family for liftinghis eyes in the way of affection towards this beauty, who may be worshipped, it seems, at a distance, but is not to be approached withother thoughts than such as we bring to the shrine of the Blessed Virgin.”“Well, you have said enough,” answered the Templar; “I will for a night put on the needful restraint, and deport me as meekly as amaiden; but as for the fear of his expelling us by violence, myself and squires, with Hamet and Abdalla, will warrant you against thatdisgrace. Doubt not that we shall be strong enough to make good our quarters.”“We must not let it come so far,” answered the Prior; “but here is the clown’s sunken cross, and the night is so dark that we canhardly see which of the roads we are to follow. He bid us turn, I think to the left.”“To the right,” said Brian, “to the best of my remembrance.”“To the left, certainly, the left; I remember his pointing with his wooden sword.”“Ay, but he held his sword in his left hand, and so pointed across his body with it,” said the Templar.Each maintained his opinion with sufﬁcient obstinacy, as is usual in all such cases; the attendants were appealed to, but they had notbeen near enough to hear Wamba’s directions. At length Brian remarked, what had at ﬁrst escaped him in the twilight; “Here is someone either asleep, or lying dead at the foot of this cross—Hugo, stir him with the butt-end of thy lance.”This was no sooner done than the ﬁgure arose, exclaiming in good French, “Whosoever thou art, it is discourteous in you to disturbmy thoughts.”“We did but wish to ask you,” said the Prior, “the road to Rotherwood, the abode of Cedric the Saxon.”“I myself am bound thither,” replied the stranger; “and if I had a horse, I would be your guide, for the way is somewhat intricate,though perfectly well known to me.”“Thou shalt have both thanks and reward, my friend,” said the Prior, “if thou wilt bring us to Cedric’s in safety.”And he caused one of his attendants to mount his own led horse, and give that upon which he had hitherto ridden to the stranger,who was to serve for a guide.Their conductor pursued an opposite road from that which Wamba had recommended, for the purpose of misleading them. The pathsoon led deeper into the woodland, and crossed more than one brook, the approach to which was rendered perilous by the marshesthrough which it ﬂowed; but the stranger seemed to know, as if by instinct, the soundest ground and the safest points of passage; andby dint of caution and attention, brought the party safely into a wilder avenue than any they had yet seen; and, pointing to a large lowirregular building at the upper extremity, he said to the Prior, “Yonder is Rotherwood, the dwelling of Cedric the Saxon.”This was a joyful intimation to Aymer, whose nerves were none of the strongest, and who had suffered such agitation and alarm inthe course of passing through the dangerous bogs, that he had not yet had the curiosity to ask his guide a single question. Findinghimself now at his ease and near shelter, his curiosity began to awake, and he demanded of the guide who and what he was.“A Palmer, just returned from the Holy Land,” was the answer.“You had better have tarried there to ﬁght for the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre,” said the Templar.“True, Reverend Sir Knight,” answered the Palmer, to whom the appearance of the Templar seemed perfectly familiar; “but whenthose who are under oath to recover the holy city, are found travelling at such a distance from the scene of their duties, can you wonderthat a peaceful peasant like me should decline the task which they have abandoned?”The Templar would have made an angry reply, but was interrupted by the Prior, who again expressed his astonishment, that theirguide, after such long absence, should be so perfectly acquainted with the passes of the forest.“I was born a native of these parts,” answered their guide, and as he made the reply they stood before the mansion of Cedric;—alow irregular building, containing several court-yards or enclosures, extending over a considerable space of ground, and which, thoughits size argued the inhabitant to be a person of wealth, differed entirely from the tall, turretted, and castellated buildings in which theNorman nobility resided, and which had become the universal style of architecture throughout England.Rotherwood was not, however, without defences; no habitation, in that disturbed period, could have been so, without the risk ofbeing plundered and burnt before the next morning. A deep fosse, or ditch, was drawn round the whole building, and ﬁlled with waterfrom a neighbouring stream. A double stockade, or palisade, composed of pointed beams, which the adjacent forest supplied, defendedthe outer and inner bank of the trench. There was an entrance from the west through the outer stockade, which communicated by adrawbridge, with a similar opening in the interior defences. Some precautions had been taken to place those entrances under theprotection of projecting angles, by which they might be ﬂanked in case of need by archers or slingers.Before this entrance the Templar wound his horn loudly; for the rain, which had long threatened, began now to descend with greatviolence.CHAPTER IIIThen (sad relief!) from the bleak coast that hearsThe German Ocean roar, deep-blooming, strong,And yellow hair’d, the blue-eyed Saxon came.THOMSON’S LIBERTYIn a hall, the height of which was greatly disproportioned to its extreme length and width, a long oaken table, formed of planksrough-hewn from the forest, and which had scarcely received any polish, stood ready prepared for the evening meal of Cedric theSaxon. The roof, composed of beams and rafters, had nothing to divide the apartment from the sky excepting the planking and thatch;there was a huge ﬁreplace at either end of the hall, but as the chimneys were constructed in a very clumsy manner, at least as much ofthe smoke found its way into the apartment as escaped by the proper vent. The constant vapour which this occasioned, had polishedthe rafters and beams of the low-browed hall, by encrusting them with a black varnish of soot. On the sides of the apartment hungimplements of war and of the chase, and there were at each corner folding doors, which gave access to other parts of the extensivebuilding.The other appointments of the mansion partook of the rude simplicity of the Saxon period, which Cedric piqued himself uponmaintaining. The ﬂoor was composed of earth mixed with lime, trodden into a hard substance, such as is often employed in ﬂooringour modern barns. For about one quarter of the length of the apartment, the ﬂoor was raised by a step, and this space, which was calledthe dais, was occupied only by the principal members of the family, and visitors of distinction. For this purpose, a table richly coveredwith scarlet cloth was placed transversely across the platform, from the middle of which ran the longer and lower board, at which thedomestics and inferior persons fed, down towards the bottom of the hall. The whole resembled the form of the letter T, or some ofthose ancient dinner-tables, which, arranged on the same principles, may be still seen in the antique Colleges of Oxford or Cambridge.Massive chairs and settles of carved oak were placed upon the dais, and over these seats and the more elevated table was fastened acanopy of cloth, which served in some degree to protect the dignitaries who occupied that distinguished station from the weather, andespecially from the rain, which in some places found its way through the ill-constructed roof.The walls of this upper end of the hall, as far as the dais extended, were covered with hangings or curtains, and upon the ﬂoor therewas a carpet, both of which were adorned with some attempts at tapestry, or embroidery, executed with brilliant or rather gaudycolouring. Over the lower range of table, the roof, as we have noticed, had no covering; the rough plastered walls were left bare, andthe rude earthen ﬂoor was uncarpeted; the board was uncovered by a cloth, and rude massive benches supplied the place of chairs.In the centre of the upper table, were placed two chairs more elevated than the rest, for the master and mistress of the family, whopresided over the scene of hospitality, and from doing so derived their Saxon title of honour, which signiﬁes “the Dividers of Bread.”To each of these chairs was added a footstool, curiously carved and inlaid with ivory, which mark of distinction was peculiar tothem. One of these seats was at present occupied by Cedric the Saxon, who, though but in rank a thane, or, as the Normans called him,a Franklin, felt, at the delay of his evening meal, an irritable impatience, which might have become an alderman, whether of ancient orof modern times.It appeared, indeed, from the countenance of this proprietor, that he was of a frank, but hasty and choleric temper. He was not abovethe middle stature, but broad-shouldered, long-armed, and powerfully made, like one accustomed to endure the fatigue of war or of thechase; his face was broad, with large blue eyes, open and frank features, ﬁne teeth, and a well formed head, altogether expressive ofthat sort of good-humour which often lodges with a sudden and hasty temper. Pride and jealousy there was in his eye, for his life hadbeen spent in asserting rights which were constantly liable to invasion; and the prompt, ﬁery, and resolute disposition of the man, hadbeen kept constantly upon the alert by the circumstances of his situation. His long yellow hair was equally divided on the top of hishead and upon his brow, and combed down on each side to the length of his shoulders; it had but little tendency to grey, althoughCedric was approaching to his sixtieth year.His dress was a tunic of forest green, furred at the throat and cuffs with what was called minever; a kind of fur inferior in quality toermine, and formed, it is believed, of the skin of the grey squirrel. This doublet hung unbuttoned over a close dress of scarlet which sattight to his body; he had breeches of the same, but they did not reach below the lower part of the thigh, leaving the knee exposed. Hisfeet had sandals of the same fashion with the peasants, but of ﬁner materials, and secured in the front with golden clasps. He hadbracelets of gold upon his arms, and a broad collar of the same precious metal around his neck. About his waist he wore a richly-studded belt, in which was stuck a short straight two-edged sword, with a sharp point, so disposed as to hang almost perpendicularlyby his side. Behind his seat was hung a scarlet cloth cloak lined with fur, and a cap of the same materials richly embroidered, whichcompleted the dress of the opulent landholder when he chose to go forth. A short boar-spear, with a broad and bright steel head, alsoreclined against the back of his chair, which served him, when he walked abroad, for the purposes of a staff or of a weapon, as chancemight require.Several domestics, whose dress held various proportions betwixt the richness of their master’s, and the coarse and simple attire ofGurth the swine-herd, watched the looks and waited the commands of the Saxon dignitary. Two or three servants of a superior orderstood behind their master upon the dais; the rest occupied the lower part of the hall. Other attendants there were of a differentdescription; two or three large and shaggy greyhounds, such as were then employed in hunting the stag and wolf; as many slow-hounds of a large bony breed, with thick necks, large heads, and long ears; and one or two of the smaller dogs, now called terriers,which waited with impatience the arrival of the supper; but, with the sagacious knowledge of physiognomy peculiar to their race,forbore to intrude upon the moody silence of their master, apprehensive probably of a small white truncheon which lay by Cedric’strencher, for the purpose of repelling the advances of his four-legged dependants. One grisly old wolf-dog alone, with the liberty of anindulged favourite, had planted himself close by the chair of state, and occasionally ventured to solicit notice by putting his large hairyhead upon his master’s knee, or pushing his nose into his hand. Even he was repelled by the stern command, “Down, Balder, down! Iam not in the humour for foolery.”In fact, Cedric, as we have observed, was in no very placid state of mind. The Lady Rowena, who had been absent to attend anevening mass at a distant church, had but just returned, and was changing her garments, which had been wetted by the storm. Therewere as yet no tidings of Gurth and his charge, which should long since have been driven home from the forest and such was theinsecurity of the period, as to render it probable that the delay might be explained by some depreciation of the outlaws, with whom theadjacent forest abounded, or by the violence of some neighbouring baron, whose consciousness of strength made him equallynegligent of the laws of property. The matter was of consequence, for great part of the domestic wealth of the Saxon proprietorsconsisted in numerous herds of swine, especially in forest-land, where those animals easily found their food.Besides these subjects of anxiety, the Saxon thane was impatient for the presence of his favourite clown Wamba, whose jests, suchas they were, served for a sort of seasoning to his evening meal, and to the deep draughts of ale and wine with which he was in thehabit of accompanying it. Add to all this, Cedric had fasted since noon, and his usual supper hour was long past, a cause of irritationcommon to country squires, both in ancient and modern times. His displeasure was expressed in broken sentences, partly muttered tohimself, partly addressed to the domestics who stood around; and particularly to his cupbearer, who offered him from time to time, asa sedative, a silver goblet ﬁlled with wine—“Why tarries the Lady Rowena?”“She is but changing her head-gear,” replied a female attendant, with as much conﬁdence as the favourite lady’s-maid usuallyanswers the master of a modern family; “you would not wish her to sit down to the banquet in her hood and kirtle? and no lady withinthe shire can be quicker in arraying herself than my mistress.”This undeniable argument produced a sort of acquiescent umph! on the part of the Saxon, with the addition, “I wish her devotionmay choose fair weather for the next visit to St John’s Kirk;—but what, in the name of ten devils,” continued he, turning to thecupbearer, and raising his voice as if happy to have found a channel into which he might divert his indignation without fear or control—“what, in the name of ten devils, keeps Gurth so long aﬁeld? I suppose we shall have an evil account of the herd; he was wont to bea faithful and cautious drudge, and I had destined him for something better; perchance I might even have made him one of mywarders.” 11Oswald the cupbearer modestly suggested, “that it was scarce an hour since the tolling of the curfew;” an ill-chosen apology, sinceit turned upon a topic so harsh to Saxon ears.“The foul ﬁend,” exclaimed Cedric, “take the curfew-bell, and the tyrannical bastard by whom it was devised, and the heartlessslave who names it with a Saxon tongue to a Saxon ear! The curfew!” he added, pausing, “ay, the curfew; which compels true men toextinguish their lights, that thieves and robbers may work their deeds in darkness!—Ay, the curfew;—Reginald Front-de-Bœuf andPhilip de Malvoisin know the use of the curfew as well as William the Bastard himself, or e’er a Norman adventurer that fought atHastings. I shall hear, I guess, that my property has been swept off to save from starving the hungry banditti, whom they cannotsupport but by theft and robbery. My faithful slave is murdered, and my goods are taken for a prey—and Wamba—where is Wamba?Said not some one he had gone forth with Gurth?”Oswald replied in the afﬁrmative.“Ay? why this is better and better! he is carried off too, the Saxon fool, to serve the Norman lord. Fools are we all indeed that servethem, and ﬁtter subjects for their scorn and laughter, than if we were born with but half our wits. But I will be avenged,” he added,starting from his chair in impatience at the supposed injury, and catching hold of his boar-spear; “I will go with my complaint to thegreat council; I have friends, I have followers—man to man will I appeal the Norman to the lists; let him come in his plate and hismail, and all that can render cowardice bold; I have sent such a javelin as this through a stronger fence than three of their war shields!—Haply they think me old; but they shall ﬁnd, alone and childless as I am, the blood of Hereward is in the veins of Cedric.—Ah,Wilfred, Wilfred!” he exclaimed in a lower tone, “couldst thou have ruled thine unreasonable passion, thy father had not been left inhis age like the solitary oak that throws out its shattered and unprotected branches against the full sweep of the tempest!” Thereﬂection seemed to conjure into sadness his irritated feelings. Replacing his javelin, he resumed his seat, bent his looks downward,and appeared to be absorbed in melancholy reﬂection.From his musing, Cedric was suddenly awakened by the blast of a horn, which was replied to by the clamorous yells and barking ofall the dogs in the hall, and some twenty or thirty which were quartered in other parts of the building. It cost some exercise of thewhite truncheon, well seconded by the exertions of the domestics, to silence this canine clamour.“To the gate, knaves!” said the Saxon, hastily, as soon as the tumult was so much appeased that the dependants could hear his voice.“See what tidings that horn tells us of—to announce, I ween, some hership 12 and robbery which has been done upon my lands.”Returning in less than three minutes, a warder announced “that the Prior Aymer of Jorvaulx, and the good knight Brian de Bois-Guilbert, commander of the valiant and venerable order of Knights Templars, with a small retinue, requested hospitality and lodgingfor the night, being on their way to a tournament which was to be held not far from Ashby-de-la-Zouche, on the second day from thepresent.”“Aymer, the Prior Aymer? Brian de Bois-Guilbert?”—muttered Cedric; “Normans both;—but Norman or Saxon, the hospitality ofRotherwood must not be impeached; they are welcome, since they have chosen to halt—more welcome would they have been to haveridden further on their way—But it were unworthy to murmur for a night’s lodging and a night’s food; in the quality of guests, at least,even Normans must suppress their insolence.—Go, Hundebert,” he added, to a sort of major-domo who stood behind him with a whitewand; “take six of the attendants, and introduce the strangers to the guests’ lodging. Look after their horses and mules, and see theirtrain lack nothing. Let them have change of vestments if they require it, and ﬁre, and water to wash, and wine and ale; and bid thecooks add what they hastily can to our evening meal; and let it be put on the board when those strangers are ready to share it. Say tothem, Hundebert, that Cedric would himself bid them welcome, but he is under a vow never to step more than three steps from thedais of his own hall to meet any who shares not the blood of Saxon royalty. Begone! see them carefully tended; let them not say intheir pride, the Saxon churl has shown at once his poverty and his avarice.”The major-domo departed with several attendants, to execute his master’s commands.“The Prior Aymer!” repeated Cedric, looking to Oswald, “the brother, if I mistake not, of Giles de Mauleverer, now lord ofMiddleham?”Oswald made a respectful sign of assent. “His brother sits in the seat, and usurps the patrimony, of a better race, the race of Ulfgarof Middleham; but what Norman lord doth not the same? This Prior is, they say, a free and jovial priest, who loves the wine-cup andthe bugle-horn better than bell and book: Good; let him come, he shall be welcome. How named ye the Templar?”“Brian de Bois-Guilbert.”“Bois-Guilbert,” said Cedric, still in the musing, half-arguing tone, which the habit of living among dependants had accustomedhim to employ, and which resembled a man who talks to himself rather than to those around him—“Bois-Guilbert? that name has beenspread wide both for good and evil. They say he is valiant as the bravest of his order; but stained with their usual vices, pride,arrogance, cruelty, and voluptuousness; a hard-hearted man, who knows neither fear of earth, nor awe of heaven. So say the fewwarriors who have returned from Palestine.—Well; it is but for one night; he shall be welcome too.—Oswald, broach the oldest wine-cask; place the best mead, the mightiest ale, the richest morat, the most sparkling cider, the most odoriferous pigments, upon theboard; ﬁll the largest horns 13 —Templars and Abbots love good wines and good measure.—Elgitha, let thy Lady Rowena, know weshall not this night expect her in the hall, unless such be her especial pleasure.”“But it will be her especial pleasure,” answered Elgitha, with great readiness, “for she is ever desirous to hear the latest news fromPalestine.”Cedric darted at the forward damsel a glance of hasty resentment; but Rowena, and whatever belonged to her, were privileged andsecure from his anger. He only replied, “Silence, maiden; thy tongue outruns thy discretion. Say my message to thy mistress, and lether do her pleasure. Here, at least, the descendant of Alfred still reigns a princess.” Elgitha left the apartment.“Palestine!” repeated the Saxon; “Palestine! how many ears are turned to the tales which dissolute crusaders, or hypocriticalpilgrims, bring from that fatal land! I too might ask—I too might enquire—I too might listen with a beating heart to fables which thewily strollers devise to cheat us into hospitality—but no—The son who has disobeyed me is no longer mine; nor will I concern myselfmore for his fate than for that of the most worthless among the millions that ever shaped the cross on their shoulder, rushed into excessand blood-guiltiness, and called it an accomplishment of the will of God.”He knit his brows, and ﬁxed his eyes for an instant on the ground; as he raised them, the folding doors at the bottom of the hall werecast wide, and, preceded by the major-domo with his wand, and four domestics bearing blazing torches, the guests of the eveningentered the apartment.CHAPTER IVWith sheep and shaggy goats the porkers bled,And the proud steer was on the marble spread;With ﬁre prepared, they deal the morsels round,Wine rosy bright the brimming goblets crown’d.Disposed apart, Ulysses shares the treat;A trivet table and ignobler seat,The Prince assigns—ODYSSEY, Book XXI.The Prior Aymer had taken the opportunity afforded him, of changing his riding robe for one of yet more costly materials, overwhich he wore a cope curiously embroidered. Besides the massive golden signet ring, which marked his ecclesiastical dignity, hisﬁngers, though contrary to the canon, were loaded with precious gems; his sandals were of the ﬁnest leather which was imported fromSpain; his beard trimmed to as small dimensions as his order would possibly permit, and his shaven crown concealed by a scarlet caprichly embroidered.The appearance of the Knight Templar was also changed; and, though less studiously bedecked with ornament, his dress was asrich, and his appearance far more commanding, than that of his companion. He had exchanged his shirt of mail for an under tunic ofdark purple silk, garnished with furs, over which ﬂowed his long robe of spotless white, in ample folds. The eight-pointed cross of hisorder was cut on the shoulder of his mantle in black velvet. The high cap no longer invested his brows, which were only shaded byshort and thick curled hair of a raven blackness, corresponding to his unusually swart complexion. Nothing could be more gracefullymajestic than his step and manner, had they not been marked by a predominant air of haughtiness, easily acquired by the exercise ofunresisted authority.These two digniﬁed persons were followed by their respective attendants, and at a more humble distance by their guide, whoseﬁgure had nothing more remarkable than it derived from the usual weeds of a pilgrim. A cloak or mantle of coarse black serge,enveloped his whole body. It was in shape something like the cloak of a modern hussar, having similar ﬂaps for covering the arms, andwas called a “Sclaveyn”, or “Sclavonian”. Coarse sandals, bound with thongs, on his bare feet; a broad and shadowy hat, with cockle-shells stitched on its brim, and a long staff shod with iron, to the upper end of which was attached a branch of palm, completed thepalmer’s attire. He followed modestly the last of the train which entered the hall, and, observing that the lower table scarce affordedroom sufﬁcient for the domestics of Cedric and the retinue of his guests, he withdrew to a settle placed beside and almost under one ofthe large chimneys, and seemed to employ himself in drying his garments, until the retreat of some one should make room at theboard, or the hospitality of the steward should supply him with refreshments in the place he had chosen apart.Cedric rose to receive his guests with an air of digniﬁed hospitality, and, descending from the dais, or elevated part of his hall, madethree steps towards them, and then awaited their approach.“I grieve,” he said, “reverend Prior, that my vow binds me to advance no farther upon this ﬂoor of my fathers, even to receive suchguests as you, and this valiant Knight of the Holy Temple. But my steward has expounded to you the cause of my seeming discourtesy.Let me also pray, that you will excuse my speaking to you in my native language, and that you will reply in the same if yourknowledge of it permits; if not, I sufﬁciently understand Norman to follow your meaning.”“V ows,” said the Abbot, “must be unloosed, worthy Franklin, or permit me rather to say, worthy Thane, though the title isantiquated. V ows are the knots which tie us to Heaven—they are the cords which bind the sacriﬁce to the horns of the altar,—and aretherefore,—as I said before,—to be unloosened and discharged, unless our holy Mother Church shall pronounce the contrary. Andrespecting language, I willingly hold communication in that spoken by my respected grandmother, Hilda of Middleham, who died inodour of sanctity, little short, if we may presume to say so, of her glorious namesake, the blessed Saint Hilda of Whitby, God begracious to her soul!”When the Prior had ceased what he meant as a conciliatory harangue, his companion said brieﬂy and emphatically, “I speak everFrench, the language of King Richard and his nobles; but I understand English sufﬁciently to communicate with the natives of thecountry.”Cedric darted at the speaker one of those hasty and impatient glances, which comparisons between the two rival nations seldomfailed to call forth; but, recollecting the duties of hospitality, he suppressed further show of resentment, and, motioning with his hand,caused his guests to assume two seats a little lower than his own, but placed close beside him, and gave a signal that the evening mealshould be placed upon the board.While the attendants hastened to obey Cedric’s commands, his eye distinguished Gurth the swineherd, who, with his companionWamba, had just entered the hall. “Send these loitering knaves up hither,” said the Saxon, impatiently. And when the culprits camebefore the dais,—“How comes it, villains! that you have loitered abroad so late as this? Hast thou brought home thy charge, sirrahGurth, or hast thou left them to robbers and marauders?”“The herd is safe, so please ye,” said Gurth.“But it does not please me, thou knave,” said Cedric, “that I should be made to suppose otherwise for two hours, and sit heredevising vengeance against my neighbours for wrongs they have not done me. I tell thee, shackles and the prison-house shall punishthe next offence of this kind.”Gurth, knowing his master’s irritable temper, attempted no exculpation; but the Jester, who could presume upon Cedric’s tolerance,by virtue of his privileges as a fool, replied for them both; “In troth, uncle Cedric, you are neither wise nor reasonable to-night.”“‘How, sir?” said his master; “you shall to the porter’s lodge, and taste of the discipline there, if you give your foolery such license.”“First let your wisdom tell me,” said Wamba, “is it just and reasonable to punish one person for the fault of another?”“Certainly not, fool,” answered Cedric.“Then why should you shackle poor Gurth, uncle, for the fault of his dog Fangs? for I dare be sworn we lost not a minute by theway, when we had got our herd together, which Fangs did not manage until we heard the vesper-bell.”“Then hang up Fangs,” said Cedric, turning hastily towards the swineherd, “if the fault is his, and get thee another dog.”“Under favour, uncle,” said the Jester, “that were still somewhat on the bow-hand of fair justice; for it was no fault of Fangs that hewas lame and could not gather the herd, but the fault of those that struck off two of his fore-claws, an operation for which, if the poorfellow had been consulted, he would scarce have given his voice.”“And who dared to lame an animal which belonged to my bondsman?” said the Saxon, kindling in wrath.“Marry, that did old Hubert,” said Wamba, “Sir Philip de Malvoisin’s keeper of the chase. He caught Fangs strolling in the forest,and said he chased the deer contrary to his master’s right, as warden of the walk.”“The foul ﬁend take Malvoisin,” answered the Saxon, “and his keeper both! I will teach them that the wood was disforested in termsof the great Forest Charter. But enough of this. Go to, knave, go to thy place—and thou, Gurth, get thee another dog, and should thekeeper dare to touch it, I will mar his archery; the curse of a coward on my head, if I strike not off the foreﬁnger of his right hand!—heshall draw bowstring no more.—I crave your pardon, my worthy guests. I am beset here with neighbours that match your inﬁdels, SirKnight, in Holy Land. But your homely fare is before you; feed, and let welcome make amends for hard fare.”The feast, however, which was spread upon the board, needed no apologies from the lord of the mansion. Swine’s ﬂesh, dressed inseveral modes, appeared on the lower part of the board, as also that of fowls, deer, goats, and hares, and various kinds of ﬁsh, togetherwith huge loaves and cakes of bread, and sundry confections made of fruits and honey. The smaller sorts of wild-fowl, of which therewas abundance, were not served up in platters, but brought in upon small wooden spits or broaches, and offered by the pages anddomestics who bore them, to each guest in succession, who cut from them such a portion as he pleased. Beside each person of rankwas placed a goblet of silver; the lower board was accommodated with large drinking horns.When the repast was about to commence, the major-domo, or steward, suddenly raising his wand, said aloud,—“Forbear!—Placefor the Lady Rowena.”A side-door at the upper end of the hall now opened behind the banquet table, and Rowena, followed by four female attendants,entered the apartment. Cedric, though surprised, and perhaps not altogether agreeably so, at his ward appearing in public on thisoccasion, hastened to meet her, and to conduct her, with respectful ceremony, to the elevated seat at his own right hand, appropriatedto the lady of the mansion. All stood up to receive her; and, replying to their courtesy by a mute gesture of salutation, she movedgracefully forward to assume her place at the board. Ere she had time to do so, the Templar whispered to the Prior, “I shall wear nocollar of gold of yours at the tournament. The Chian wine is your own.”“Said I not so?” answered the Prior; “but check your raptures, the Franklin observes you.”Unheeding this remonstrance, and accustomed only to act upon the immediate impulse of his own wishes, Brian de Bois-Guilbertkept his eyes riveted on the Saxon beauty, more striking perhaps to his imagination, because differing widely from those of the Easternsultanas.Formed in the best proportions of her sex, Rowena was tall in stature, yet not so much so as to attract observation on account ofsuperior height. Her complexion was exquisitely fair, but the noble cast of her head and features prevented the insipidity whichsometimes attaches to fair beauties. Her clear blue eye, which sat enshrined beneath a graceful eyebrow of brown sufﬁciently markedto give expression to the forehead, seemed capable to kindle as well as melt, to command as well as to beseech. If mildness were themore natural expression of such a combination of features, it was plain, that in the present instance, the exercise of habitualsuperiority, and the reception of general homage, had given to the Saxon lady a loftier character, which mingled with and qualiﬁed thatbestowed by nature. Her profuse hair, of a colour betwixt brown and ﬂaxen, was arranged in a fanciful and graceful manner innumerous ringlets, to form which art had probably aided nature. These locks were braided with gems, and, being worn at full length,intimated the noble birth and free-born condition of the maiden. A golden chain, to which was attached a small reliquary of the samemetal, hung round her neck. She wore bracelets on her arms, which were bare. Her dress was an under-gown and kirtle of pale sea-green silk, over which hung a long loose robe, which reached to the ground, having very wide sleeves, which came down, however,very little below the elbow. This robe was crimson, and manufactured out of the very ﬁnest wool. A veil of silk, interwoven with gold,was attached to the upper part of it, which could be, at the wearer’s pleasure, either drawn over the face and bosom after the Spanishfashion, or disposed as a sort of drapery round the shoulders.When Rowena perceived the Knight Templar’s eyes bent on her with an ardour, that, compared with the dark caverns under whichthey moved, gave them the effect of lighted charcoal, she drew with dignity the veil around her face, as an intimation that thedetermined freedom of his glance was disagreeable. Cedric saw the motion and its cause. “Sir Templar,” said he, “the cheeks of ourSaxon maidens have seen too little of the sun to enable them to bear the ﬁxed glance of a crusader.”“If I have offended,” replied Sir Brian, “I crave your pardon,—that is, I crave the Lady Rowena’s pardon,—for my humility willcarry me no lower.”“The Lady Rowena,” said the Prior, “has punished us all, in chastising the boldness of my friend. Let me hope she will be less cruelto the splendid train which are to meet at the tournament.”“Our going thither,” said Cedric, “is uncertain. I love not these vanities, which were unknown to my fathers when England wasfree.”“Let us hope, nevertheless,” said the Prior, “our company may determine you to travel thitherward; when the roads are so unsafe,the escort of Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert is not to be despised.”“Sir Prior,” answered the Saxon, “wheresoever I have travelled in this land, I have hitherto found myself, with the assistance of mygood sword and faithful followers, in no respect needful of other aid. At present, if we indeed journey to Ashby-de-la-Zouche, we doso with my noble neighbour and countryman Athelstane of Coningsburgh, and with such a train as would set outlaws and feudalenemies at deﬁance.—I drink to you, Sir Prior, in this cup of wine, which I trust your taste will approve, and I thank you for yourcourtesy. Should you be so rigid in adhering to monastic rule,” he added, “as to prefer your acid preparation of milk, I hope you willnot strain courtesy to do me reason.”“Nay,” said the Priest, laughing, “it is only in our abbey that we conﬁne ourselves to the ‘lac dulce’ or the ‘lac acidum’ either.Conversing with, the world, we use the world’s fashions, and therefore I answer your pledge in this honest wine, and leave the weakerliquor to my lay-brother.”“And I,” said the Templar, ﬁlling his goblet, “drink wassail to the fair Rowena; for since her namesake introduced the word intoEngland, has never been one more worthy of such a tribute. By my faith, I could pardon the unhappy V ortigern, had he half the causethat we now witness, for making shipwreck of his honour and his kingdom.”“I will spare your courtesy, Sir Knight,” said Rowena with dignity, and without unveiling herself; “or rather I will tax it so far as torequire of you the latest news from Palestine, a theme more agreeable to our English ears than the compliments which your Frenchbreeding teaches.”“I have little of importance to say, lady,” answered Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert, “excepting the conﬁrmed tidings of a truce withSaladin.”He was interrupted by Wamba, who had taken his appropriated seat upon a chair, the back of which was decorated with two ass’sears, and which was placed about two steps behind that of his master, who, from time to time, supplied him with victuals from his owntrencher; a favour, however, which the Jester shared with the favourite dogs, of whom, as we have already noticed, there were severalin attendance. Here sat Wamba, with a small table before him, his heels tucked up against the bar of the chair, his cheeks sucked up soas to make his jaws resemble a pair of nut-crackers, and his eyes half-shut, yet watching with alertness every opportunity to exercisehis licensed foolery.“These truces with the inﬁdels,” he exclaimed, without caring how suddenly he interrupted the stately Templar, “make an old manof me!”“Go to, knave, how so?” said Cedric, his features prepared to receive favourably the expected jest.“Because,” answered Wamba, “I remember three of them in my day, each of which was to endure for the course of ﬁfty years; sothat, by computation, I must be at least a hundred and ﬁfty years old.”“I will warrant you against dying of old age, however,” said the Templar, who now recognised his friend of the forest; “I will assureyou from all deaths but a violent one, if you give such directions to wayfarers, as you did this night to the Prior and me.”“How, sirrah!” said Cedric, “misdirect travellers? We must have you whipt; you are at least as much rogue as fool.”“I pray thee, uncle,” answered the Jester, “let my folly, for once, protect my roguery. I did but make a mistake between my righthand and my left; and he might have pardoned a greater, who took a fool for his counsellor and guide.”Conversation was here interrupted by the entrance of the porter’s page, who announced that there was a stranger at the gate,imploring admittance and hospitality.“Admit him,” said Cedric, “be he who or what he may;—a night like that which roars without, compels even wild animals to herdwith tame, and to seek the protection of man, their mortal foe, rather than perish by the elements. Let his wants be ministered to withall care—look to it, Oswald.”And the steward left the banqueting hall to see the commands of his patron obeyed.CHAPTER VHath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? Fed with the same food, hurt with the sameweapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is?MERCHANT OF VENICEOswald, returning, whispered into the ear of his master, “It is a Jew, who calls himself Isaac of York; is it ﬁt I should marshall himinto the hall?”“Let Gurth do thine ofﬁce, Oswald,” said Wamba with his usual effrontery; “the swineherd will be a ﬁt usher to the Jew.”“St Mary,” said the Abbot, crossing himself, “an unbelieving Jew, and admitted into this presence!”“A dog Jew,” echoed the Templar, “to approach a defender of the Holy Sepulchre?”“By my faith,” said Wamba, “it would seem the Templars love the Jews’ inheritance better than they do their company.”“Peace, my worthy guests,” said Cedric; “my hospitality must not be bounded by your dislikes. If Heaven bore with the wholenation of stiff-necked unbelievers for more years than a layman can number, we may endure the presence of one Jew for a few hours.But I constrain no man to converse or to feed with him.—Let him have a board and a morsel apart,—unless,” he said smiling, “theseturban’d strangers will admit his society.”“Sir Franklin,” answered the Templar, “my Saracen slaves are true Moslems, and scorn as much as any Christian to hold intercoursewith a Jew.”“Now, in faith,” said Wamba, “I cannot see that the worshippers of Mahound and Termagaunt have so greatly the advantage overthe people once chosen of Heaven.”“He shall sit with thee, Wamba,” said Cedric; “the fool and the knave will be well met.”“The fool,” answered Wamba, raising the relics of a gammon of bacon, “will take care to erect a bulwark against the knave.”“Hush,” said Cedric, “for here he comes.”Introduced with little ceremony, and advancing with fear and hesitation, and many a bow of deep humility, a tall thin old man, who,however, had lost by the habit of stooping much of his actual height, approached the lower end of the board. His features, keen andregular, with an aquiline nose, and piercing black eyes; his high and wrinkled forehead, and long grey hair and beard, would have beenconsidered as handsome, had they not been the marks of a physiognomy peculiar to a race, which, during those dark ages, was alikedetested by the credulous and prejudiced vulgar, and persecuted by the greedy and rapacious nobility, and who, perhaps, owing to thatvery hatred and persecution, had adopted a national character, in which there was much, to say the least, mean and unamiable.The Jew’s dress, which appeared to have suffered considerably from the storm, was a plain russet cloak of many folds, covering adark purple tunic. He had large boots lined with fur, and a belt around his waist, which sustained a small knife, together with a case forwriting materials, but no weapon. He wore a high square yellow cap of a peculiar fashion, assigned to his nation to distinguish themfrom Christians, and which he doffed with great humility at the door of the hall.The reception of this person in the hall of Cedric the Saxon, was such as might have satisﬁed the most prejudiced enemy of thetribes of Israel. Cedric himself coldly nodded in answer to the Jew’s repeated salutations, and signed to him to take place at the lowerend of the table, where, however, no one offered to make room for him. On the contrary, as he passed along the ﬁle, casting a timidsupplicating glance, and turning towards each of those who occupied the lower end of the board, the Saxon domestics squared theirshoulders, and continued to devour their supper with great perseverance, paying not the least attention to the wants of the new guest.The attendants of the Abbot crossed themselves, with looks of pious horror, and the very heathen Saracens, as Isaac drew near them,curled up their whiskers with indignation, and laid their hands on their poniards, as if ready to rid themselves by the most desperatemeans from the apprehended contamination of his nearer approach.Probably the same motives which induced Cedric to open his hall to this son of a rejected people, would have made him insist onhis attendants receiving Isaac with more courtesy. But the Abbot had, at this moment, engaged him in a most interesting discussion onthe breed and character of his favourite hounds, which he would not have interrupted for matters of much greater importance than thatof a Jew going to bed supperless. While Isaac thus stood an outcast in the present society, like his people among the nations, lookingin vain for welcome or resting place, the pilgrim who sat by the chimney took compassion upon him, and resigned his seat, sayingbrieﬂy, “Old man, my garments are dried, my hunger is appeased, thou art both wet and fasting.” So saying, he gathered together, andbrought to a ﬂame, the decaying brands which lay scattered on the ample hearth; took from the larger board a mess of pottage andseethed kid, placed it upon the small table at which he had himself supped, and, without waiting the Jew’s thanks, went to the otherside of the hall;—whether from unwillingness to hold more close communication with the object of his benevolence, or from a wish todraw near to the upper end of the table, seemed uncertain.Had there been painters in those days capable to execute such a subject, the Jew, as he bent his withered form, and expanded hischilled and trembling hands over the ﬁre, would have formed no bad emblematical personiﬁcation of the Winter season. Havingdispelled the cold, he turned eagerly to the smoking mess which was placed before him, and ate with a haste and an apparent relish,that seemed to betoken long abstinence from food.Meanwhile the Abbot and Cedric continued their discourse upon hunting; the Lady Rowena seemed engaged in conversation withone of her attendant females; and the haughty Templar, whose eye wandered from the Jew to the Saxon beauty, revolved in his mindthoughts which appeared deeply to interest him.“I marvel, worthy Cedric,” said the Abbot, as their discourse proceeded, “that, great as your predilection is for your own manlylanguage, you do not receive the Norman-French into your favour, so far at least as the mystery of wood-craft and hunting isconcerned. Surely no tongue is so rich in the various phrases which the ﬁeld-sports demand, or furnishes means to the experiencedwoodman so well to express his jovial art.”“Good Father Aymer,” said the Saxon, “be it known to you, I care not for those over-sea reﬁnements, without which I can wellenough take my pleasure in the woods. I can wind my horn, though I call not the blast either a ‘recheate’ or a ‘morte’—I can cheer mydogs on the prey, and I can ﬂay and quarter the animal when it is brought down, without using the newfangled jargon of ‘curee, arbor,nombles’, and all the babble of the fabulous Sir Tristrem.” 14“The French,” said the Templar, raising his voice with the presumptuous and authoritative tone which he used upon all occasions,“is not only the natural language of the chase, but that of love and of war, in which ladies should be won and enemies deﬁed.”“Pledge me in a cup of wine, Sir Templar,” said Cedric, “and ﬁll another to the Abbot, while I look back some thirty years to tellyou another tale. As Cedric the Saxon then was, his plain English tale needed no garnish from French troubadours, when it was told inthe ear of beauty; and the ﬁeld of Northallerton, upon the day of the Holy Standard, could tell whether the Saxon war-cry was notheard as far within the ranks of the Scottish host as the ‘cri de guerre’ of the boldest Norman baron. To the memory of the brave whofought there!—Pledge me, my guests.” He drank deep, and went on with increasing warmth. “Ay, that was a day of cleaving ofshields, when a hundred banners were bent forwards over the heads of the valiant, and blood ﬂowed round like water, and death washeld better than ﬂight. A Saxon bard had called it a feast of the swords—a gathering of the eagles to the prey—the clashing of billsupon shield and helmet, the shouting of battle more joyful than the clamour of a bridal. But our bards are no more,” he said; “ourdeeds are lost in those of another race—our language—our very name—is hastening to decay, and none mourns for it save one solitaryold man—Cupbearer! knave, ﬁll the goblets—To the strong in arms, Sir Templar, be their race or language what it will, who now bearthem best in Palestine among the champions of the Cross!”them best in Palestine among the champions of the Cross!”“It becomes not one wearing this badge to answer,” said Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert; “yet to whom, besides the sworn Champions ofthe Holy Sepulchre, can the palm be assigned among the champions of the Cross?”“To the Knights Hospitallers,” said the Abbot; “I have a brother of their order.”“I impeach not their fame,” said the Templar; “nevertheless—-”“I think, friend Cedric,” said Wamba, interfering, “that had Richard of the Lion’s Heart been wise enough to have taken a fool’sadvice, he might have staid at home with his merry Englishmen, and left the recovery of Jerusalem to those same Knights who hadmost to do with the loss of it.”“Were there, then, none in the English army,” said the Lady Rowena, “whose names are worthy to be mentioned with the Knights ofthe Temple, and of St John?”“Forgive me, lady,” replied De Bois-Guilbert; “the English monarch did, indeed, bring to Palestine a host of gallant warriors,second only to those whose breasts have been the unceasing bulwark of that blessed land.”“Second to NONE,” said the Pilgrim, who had stood near enough to hear, and had listened to this conversation with markedimpatience. All turned toward the spot from whence this unexpected asseveration was heard.
“I say,” repeated the Pilgrim in a ﬁrm and strong voice, “that the English chivalry were second to NONE who ever drew sword indefence of the Holy Land. I say besides, for I saw it, that King Richard himself, and ﬁve of his knights, held a tournament after thetaking of St John-de-Acre, as challengers against all comers. I say that, on that day, each knight ran three courses, and cast to theground three antagonists. I add, that seven of these assailants were Knights of the Temple—and Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert well knowsthe truth of what I tell you.”It is impossible for language to describe the bitter scowl of rage which rendered yet darker the swarthy countenance of the Templar.In the extremity of his resentment and confusion, his quivering ﬁngers griped towards the handle of his sword, and perhaps onlywithdrew, from the consciousness that no act of violence could be safely executed in that place and presence. Cedric, whose feelingswere all of a right onward and simple kind, and were seldom occupied by more than one object at once, omitted, in the joyous gleewith which he heard of the glory of his countrymen, to remark the angry confusion of his guest; “I would give thee this goldenbracelet, Pilgrim,” he said, “couldst thou tell me the names of those knights who upheld so gallantly the renown of merry England.”“That will I do blithely,” replied the Pilgrim, “and without guerdon; my oath, for a time, prohibits me from touching gold.”“I will wear the bracelet for you, if you will, friend Palmer,” said Wamba.“The ﬁrst in honour as in arms, in renown as in place,” said the Pilgrim, “was the brave Richard, King of England.”“I forgive him,” said Cedric; “I forgive him his descent from the tyrant Duke William.”“The Earl of Leicester was the second,” continued the Pilgrim; “Sir Thomas Multon of Gilsland was the third.”“Of Saxon descent, he at least,” said Cedric, with exultation.“Sir Foulk Doilly the fourth,” proceeded the Pilgrim.“Saxon also, at least by the mother’s side,” continued Cedric, who listened with the utmost eagerness, and forgot, in part at least, hishatred to the Normans, in the common triumph of the King of England and his islanders. “And who was the ﬁfth?” he demanded.“The ﬁfth was Sir Edwin Turneham.”“Genuine Saxon, by the soul of Hengist!” shouted Cedric—“And the sixth?” he continued with eagerness—“how name you thesixth?”“The sixth,” said the Palmer, after a pause, in which he seemed to recollect himself, “was a young knight of lesser renown andlower rank, assumed into that honourable company, less to aid their enterprise than to make up their number—his name dwells not inmy memory.”“Sir Palmer,” said Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert scornfully, “this assumed forgetfulness, after so much has been remembered, comestoo late to serve your purpose. I will myself tell the name of the knight before whose lance fortune and my horse’s fault occasioned myfalling—it was the Knight of Ivanhoe; nor was there one of the six that, for his years, had more renown in arms.—Yet this will I say,and loudly—that were he in England, and durst repeat, in this week’s tournament, the challenge of St John-de-Acre, I, mounted andarmed as I now am, would give him every advantage of weapons, and abide the result.”“Your challenge would soon be answered,” replied the Palmer, “were your antagonist near you. As the matter is, disturb not thepeaceful hall with vaunts of the issue of the conﬂict, which you well know cannot take place. If Ivanhoe ever returns from Palestine, Iwill be his surety that he meets you.”“A goodly security!” said the Knight Templar; “and what do you proffer as a pledge?”“This reliquary,” said the Palmer, taking a small ivory box from his bosom, and crossing himself, “containing a portion of the truecross, brought from the Monastery of Mount Carmel.”The Prior of Jorvaulx crossed himself and repeated a pater noster, in which all devoutly joined, excepting the Jew, the Mahomedans,and the Templar; the latter of whom, without vailing his bonnet, or testifying any reverence for the alleged sanctity of the relic, tookfrom his neck a gold chain, which he ﬂung on the board, saying—“Let Prior Aymer hold my pledge and that of this nameless vagrant,in token that when the Knight of Ivanhoe comes within the four seas of Britain, he underlies the challenge of Brian de Bois-Guilbert,which, if he answer not, I will proclaim him as a coward on the walls of every Temple Court in Europe.”“It will not need,” said the Lady Rowena, breaking silence; “My voice shall be heard, if no other in this hall is raised in behalf ofthe absent Ivanhoe. I afﬁrm he will meet fairly every honourable challenge. Could my weak warrant add security to the inestimablepledge of this holy pilgrim, I would pledge name and fame that Ivanhoe gives this proud knight the meeting he desires.”A crowd of conﬂicting emotions seemed to have occupied Cedric, and kept him silent during this discussion. Gratiﬁed pride,resentment, embarrassment, chased each other over his broad and open brow, like the shadow of clouds drifting over a harvest-ﬁeld;while his attendants, on whom the name of the sixth knight seemed to produce an effect almost electrical, hung in suspense upon theirmaster’s looks. But when Rowena spoke, the sound of her voice seemed to startle him from his silence.“Lady,” said Cedric, “this beseems not; were further pledge necessary, I myself, offended, and justly offended, as I am, would yetgage my honour for the honour of Ivanhoe. But the wager of battle is complete, even according to the fantastic fashions of Normanchivalry—Is it not, Father Aymer?”“It is,” replied the Prior; “and the blessed relic and rich chain will I bestow safely in the treasury of our convent, until the decisionof this warlike challenge.”Having thus spoken, he crossed himself again and again, and after many genuﬂections and muttered prayers, he delivered thereliquary to Brother Ambrose, his attendant monk, while he himself swept up with less ceremony, but perhaps with no less internalsatisfaction, the golden chain, and bestowed it in a pouch lined with perfumed leather, which opened under his arm. “And now, SirCedric,” he said, “my ears are chiming vespers with the strength of your good wine—permit us another pledge to the welfare of theLady Rowena, and indulge us with liberty to pass to our repose.”“By the rood of Bromholme,” said the Saxon, “you do but small credit to your fame, Sir Prior! Report speaks you a bonny monk,that would hear the matin chime ere he quitted his bowl; and, old as I am, I feared to have shame in encountering you. But, by myfaith, a Saxon boy of twelve, in my time, would not so soon have relinquished his goblet.”The Prior had his own reasons, however, for persevering in the course of temperance which he had adopted. He was not only aprofessional peacemaker, but from practice a hater of all feuds and brawls. It was not altogether from a love to his neighbour, or tohimself, or from a mixture of both. On the present occasion, he had an instinctive apprehension of the ﬁery temper of the Saxon, andsaw the danger that the reckless and presumptuous spirit, of which his companion had already given so many proofs, might at lengthproduce some disagreeable explosion. He therefore gently insinuated the incapacity of the native of any other country to engage in thegenial conﬂict of the bowl with the hardy and strong-headed Saxons; something he mentioned, but slightly, about his own holycharacter, and ended by pressing his proposal to depart to repose.The grace-cup was accordingly served round, and the guests, after making deep obeisance to their landlord and to the LadyRowena, arose and mingled in the hall, while the heads of the family, by separate doors, retired with their attendants.“Unbelieving dog,” said the Templar to Isaac the Jew, as he passed him in the throng, “dost thou bend thy course to thetournament?”“I do so propose,” replied Isaac, bowing in all humility, “if it please your reverend valour.”“Ay,” said the Knight, “to gnaw the bowels of our nobles with usury, and to gull women and boys with gauds and toys—I warrantthee store of shekels in thy Jewish scrip.”“Not a shekel, not a silver penny, not a halﬂing—so help me the God of Abraham!” said the Jew, clasping his hands; “I go but toseek the assistance of some brethren of my tribe to aid me to pay the ﬁne which the Exchequer of the Jews have imposed upon me—Father Jacob be my speed! I am an impoverished wretch—the very gaberdine I wear is borrowed from Reuben of Tadcaster.” 15The Templar smiled sourly as he replied, “Beshrew thee for a false-hearted liar!” and passing onward, as if disdaining fartherconference, he communed with his Moslem slaves in a language unknown to the bystanders. The poor Israelite seemed so staggeredby the address of the military monk, that the Templar had passed on to the extremity of the hall ere he raised his head from the humbleposture which he had assumed, so far as to be sensible of his departure. And when he did look around, it was with the astonished air ofone at whose feet a thunderbolt has just burst, and who hears still the astounding report ringing in his ears.The Templar and Prior were shortly after marshalled to their sleeping apartments by the steward and the cupbearer, each attended bytwo torchbearers and two servants carrying refreshments, while servants of inferior condition indicated to their retinue and to the otherguests their respective places of repose.CHAPTER VITo buy his favour I extend this friendship:If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.MERCHANT OF VENICEAs the Palmer, lighted by a domestic with a torch, passed through the intricate combination of apartments of this large and irregularmansion, the cupbearer coming behind him whispered in his ear, that if he had no objection to a cup of good mead in his apartment,there were many domestics in that family who would gladly hear the news he had brought from the Holy Land, and particularly thatwhich concerned the Knight of Ivanhoe. Wamba presently appeared to urge the same request, observing that a cup after midnight wasworth three after curfew. Without disputing a maxim urged by such grave authority, the Palmer thanked them for their courtesy, butobserved that he had included in his religious vow, an obligation never to speak in the kitchen on matters which were prohibited in thehall. “That vow,” said Wamba to the cupbearer, “would scarce suit a serving-man.”The cupbearer shrugged up his shoulders in displeasure. “I thought to have lodged him in the solere chamber,” said he; “but since heis so unsocial to Christians, e’en let him take the next stall to Isaac the Jew’s.—Anwold,” said he to the torchbearer, “carry the Pilgrimto the southern cell.—I give you good-night,” he added, “Sir Palmer, with small thanks for short courtesy.”“Good-night, and Our Lady’s benison,” said the Palmer, with composure; and his guide moved forward.In a small antechamber, into which several doors opened, and which was lighted by a small iron lamp, they met a secondinterruption from the waiting-maid of Rowena, who, saying in a tone of authority, that her mistress desired to speak with the Palmer,took the torch from the hand of Anwold, and, bidding him await her return, made a sign to the Palmer to follow. Apparently he did notthink it proper to decline this invitation as he had done the former; for, though his gesture indicated some surprise at the summons, heobeyed it without answer or remonstrance.A short passage, and an ascent of seven steps, each of which was composed of a solid beam of oak, led him to the apartment of theLady Rowena, the rude magniﬁcence of which corresponded to the respect which was paid to her by the lord of the mansion. Thewalls were covered with embroidered hangings, on which different-coloured silks, interwoven with gold and silver threads, had beenemployed with all the art of which the age was capable, to represent the sports of hunting and hawking. The bed was adorned with thesame rich tapestry, and surrounded with curtains dyed with purple. The seats had also their stained coverings, and one, which washigher than the rest, was accommodated with a footstool of ivory, curiously carved.No fewer than four silver candelabras, holding great waxen torches, served to illuminate this apartment. Yet let not modern beautyenvy the magniﬁcence of a Saxon princess. The walls of the apartment were so ill ﬁnished and so full of crevices, that the richhangings shook in the night blast, and, in despite of a sort of screen intended to protect them from the wind, the ﬂame of the torchesstreamed sideways into the air, like the unfurled pennon of a chieftain. Magniﬁcence there was, with some rude attempt at taste; but ofcomfort there was little, and, being unknown, it was unmissed.The Lady Rowena, with three of her attendants standing at her back, and arranging her hair ere she lay down to rest, was seated inthe sort of throne already mentioned, and looked as if born to exact general homage. The Pilgrim acknowledged her claim to it by alow genuﬂection.“Rise, Palmer,” said she graciously. “The defender of the absent has a right to favourable reception from all who value truth, andhonour manhood.” She then said to her train, “Retire, excepting only Elgitha; I would speak with this holy Pilgrim.”The maidens, without leaving the apartment, retired to its further extremity, and sat down on a small bench against the wall, wherethey remained mute as statues, though at such a distance that their whispers could not have interrupted the conversation of theirmistress.“Pilgrim,” said the lady, after a moment’s pause, during which she seemed uncertain how to address him, “you this night mentioneda name—I mean,” she said, with a degree of effort, “the name of Ivanhoe, in the halls where by nature and kindred it should havesounded most acceptably; and yet, such is the perverse course of fate, that of many whose hearts must have throbbed at the sound, I,only, dare ask you where, and in what condition, you left him of whom you spoke?—We heard, that, having remained in Palestine, onaccount of his impaired health, after the departure of the English army, he had experienced the persecution of the French faction, towhom the Templars are known to be attached.”“I know little of the Knight of Ivanhoe,” answered the Palmer, with a troubled voice. “I would I knew him better, since you, lady,are interested in his fate. He hath, I believe, surmounted the persecution of his enemies in Palestine, and is on the eve of returning toEngland, where you, lady, must know better than I, what is his chance of happiness.”The Lady Rowena sighed deeply, and asked more particularly when the Knight of Ivanhoe might be expected in his native country,and whether he would not be exposed to great dangers by the road. On the ﬁrst point, the Palmer professed ignorance; on the second,he said that the voyage might be safely made by the way of Venice and Genoa, and from thence through France to England.“Ivanhoe,” he said, “was so well acquainted with the language and manners of the French, that there was no fear of his incurring anyhazard during that part of his travels.”“Would to God,” said the Lady Rowena, “he were here safely arrived, and able to bear arms in the approaching tourney, in whichthe chivalry of this land are expected to display their address and valour. Should Athelstane of Coningsburgh obtain the prize, Ivanhoeis like to hear evil tidings when he reaches England.—How looked he, stranger, when you last saw him? Had disease laid her handheavy upon his strength and comeliness?”“He was darker,” said the Palmer, “and thinner, than when he came from Cyprus in the train of Cœur-de-Lion, and care seemed tosit heavy on his brow; but I approached not his presence, because he is unknown to me.”“He will,” said the lady, “I fear, ﬁnd little in his native land to clear those clouds from his countenance. Thanks, good Pilgrim, foryour information concerning the companion of my childhood.—Maidens,” she said, “draw near—offer the sleeping cup to this holyman, whom I will no longer detain from repose.”One of the maidens presented a silver cup, containing a rich mixture of wine and spice, which Rowena barely put to her lips. It wasthen offered to the Palmer, who, after a low obeisance, tasted a few drops.“Accept this alms, friend,” continued the lady, offering a piece of gold, “in acknowledgment of thy painful travail, and of theshrines thou hast visited.”The Palmer received the boon with another low reverence, and followed Edwina out of the apartment.In the anteroom he found his attendant Anwold, who, taking the torch from the hand of the waiting-maid, conducted him with morehaste than ceremony to an exterior and ignoble part of the building, where a number of small apartments, or rather cells, served forsleeping places to the lower order of domestics, and to strangers of mean degree.“In which of these sleeps the Jew?” said the Pilgrim.“The unbelieving dog,” answered Anwold, “kennels in the cell next your holiness.—St Dunstan, how it must be scraped andcleansed ere it be again ﬁt for a Christian!”“And where sleeps Gurth the swineherd?” said the stranger.“Gurth,” replied the bondsman, “sleeps in the cell on your right, as the Jew on that to your left; you serve to keep the child ofcircumcision separate from the abomination of his tribe. You might have occupied a more honourable place had you accepted ofOswald’s invitation.”“It is as well as it is,” said the Palmer; “the company, even of a Jew, can hardly spread contamination through an oaken partition.”So saying, he entered the cabin allotted to him, and taking the torch from the domestic’s hand, thanked him, and wished him good-night. Having shut the door of his cell, he placed the torch in a candlestick made of wood, and looked around his sleeping apartment,the furniture of which was of the most simple kind. It consisted of a rude wooden stool, and still ruder hutch or bed-frame, stuffed withclean straw, and accommodated with two or three sheepskins by way of bed-clothes.The Palmer, having extinguished his torch, threw himself, without taking off any part of his clothes, on this rude couch, and slept, orat least retained his recumbent posture, till the earliest sunbeams found their way through the little grated window, which served atonce to admit both air and light to his uncomfortable cell. He then started up, and after repeating his matins, and adjusting his dress, heleft it, and entered that of Isaac the Jew, lifting the latch as gently as he could.The inmate was lying in troubled slumber upon a couch similar to that on which the Palmer himself had passed the night. Such partsof his dress as the Jew had laid aside on the preceding evening, were disposed carefully around his person, as if to prevent the hazardof their being carried off during his slumbers. There was a trouble on his brow amounting almost to agony. His hands and arms movedconvulsively, as if struggling with the nightmare; and besides several ejaculations in Hebrew, the following were distinctly heard in theNorman-English, or mixed language of the country: “For the sake of the God of Abraham, spare an unhappy old man! I am poor, I ampenniless—should your irons wrench my limbs asunder, I could not gratify you!”The Palmer awaited not the end of the Jew’s vision, but stirred him with his pilgrim’s staff. The touch probably associated, as isusual, with some of the apprehensions excited by his dream; for the old man started up, his grey hair standing almost erect upon hishead, and huddling some part of his garments about him, while he held the detached pieces with the tenacious grasp of a falcon, heﬁxed upon the Palmer his keen black eyes, expressive of wild surprise and of bodily apprehension.“Fear nothing from me, Isaac,” said the Palmer, “I come as your friend.”“The God of Israel requite you,” said the Jew, greatly relieved; “I dreamed—But Father Abraham be praised, it was but a dream.”Then, collecting himself, he added in his usual tone, “And what may it be your pleasure to want at so early an hour with the poorJew?”“It is to tell you,” said the Palmer, “that if you leave not this mansion instantly, and travel not with some haste, your journey mayprove a dangerous one.”“Holy father!” said the Jew, “whom could it interest to endanger so poor a wretch as I am?”“The purpose you can best guess,” said the Pilgrim; “but rely on this, that when the Templar crossed the hall yesternight, he spoketo his Mussulman slaves in the Saracen language, which I well understand, and charged them this morning to watch the journey of theJew, to seize upon him when at a convenient distance from the mansion, and to conduct him to the castle of Philip de Malvoisin, or tothat of Reginald Front-de-Bœuf.”It is impossible to describe the extremity of terror which seized upon the Jew at this information, and seemed at once to overpowerhis whole faculties. His arms fell down to his sides, and his head drooped on his breast, his knees bent under his weight, every nerveand muscle of his frame seemed to collapse and lose its energy, and he sunk at the foot of the Palmer, not in the fashion of one whointentionally stoops, kneels, or prostrates himself to excite compassion, but like a man borne down on all sides by the pressure of someinvisible force, which crushes him to the earth without the power of resistance.“Holy God of Abraham!” was his ﬁrst exclamation, folding and elevating his wrinkled hands, but without raising his grey headfrom the pavement; “Oh, holy Moses! O, blessed Aaron! the dream is not dreamed for nought, and the vision cometh not in vain! Ifeel their irons already tear my sinews! I feel the rack pass over my body like the saws, and harrows, and axes of iron over the men ofRabbah, and of the cities of the children of Ammon!”“Stand up, Isaac, and hearken to me,” said the Palmer, who viewed the extremity of his distress with a compassion in whichcontempt was largely mingled; “you have cause for your terror, considering how your brethren have been used, in order to extort fromthem their hoards, both by princes and nobles; but stand up, I say, and I will point out to you the means of escape. Leave this mansioninstantly, while its inmates sleep sound after the last night’s revel. I will guide you by the secret paths of the forest, known as well tome as to any forester that ranges it, and I will not leave you till you are under safe conduct of some chief or baron going to thetournament, whose good-will you have probably the means of securing.”As the ears of Isaac received the hopes of escape which this speech intimated, he began gradually, and inch by inch, as it were, toraise himself up from the ground, until he fairly rested upon his knees, throwing back his long grey hair and beard, and ﬁxing his keenblack eyes upon the Palmer’s face, with a look expressive at once of hope and fear, not unmingled with suspicion. But when he heardthe concluding part of the sentence, his original terror appeared to revive in full force, and he dropt once more on his face, exclaiming,“I possess the means of securing good-will! alas! there is but one road to the favour of a Christian, and how can the poor Jew ﬁnd it,whom extortions have already reduced to the misery of Lazarus?” Then, as if suspicion had overpowered his other feelings, hesuddenly exclaimed, “For the love of God, young man, betray me not—for the sake of the Great Father who made us all, Jew as wellas Gentile, Israelite and Ishmaelite—do me no treason! I have not means to secure the good-will of a Christian beggar, were he ratingit at a single penny.” As he spoke these last words, he raised himself, and grasped the Palmer’s mantle with a look of the most earnestentreaty. The pilgrim extricated himself, as if there were contamination in the touch.“Wert thou loaded with all the wealth of thy tribe,” he said, “what interest have I to injure thee?—In this dress I am vowed topoverty, nor do I change it for aught save a horse and a coat of mail. Yet think not that I care for thy company, or propose myselfadvantage by it; remain here if thou wilt—Cedric the Saxon may protect thee.”“Alas!” said the Jew, “he will not let me travel in his train—Saxon or Norman will be equally ashamed of the poor Israelite; and totravel by myself through the domains of Philip de Malvoisin and Reginald Front-de-Bœuf—Good youth, I will go with you!—Let ushaste—let us gird up our loins—let us ﬂee!—Here is thy staff, why wilt thou tarry?”“I tarry not,” said the Pilgrim, giving way to the urgency of his companion; “but I must secure the means of leaving this place—follow me.”He led the way to the adjoining cell, which, as the reader is apprised, was occupied by Gurth the swineherd.—“Arise, Gurth,” saidthe Pilgrim, “arise quickly. Undo the postern gate, and let out the Jew and me.”Gurth, whose occupation, though now held so mean, gave him as much consequence in Saxon England as that of Eumaeus inIthaca, was offended at the familiar and commanding tone assumed by the Palmer. “The Jew leaving Rotherwood,” said he, raisinghimself on his elbow, and looking superciliously at him without quitting his pallet, “and travelling in company with the Palmer to boot—”“I should as soon have dreamt,” said Wamba, who entered the apartment at the instant, “of his stealing away with a gammon ofbacon.”“Nevertheless,” said Gurth, again laying down his head on the wooden log which served him for a pillow, “both Jew and Gentilemust be content to abide the opening of the great gate—we suffer no visitors to depart by stealth at these unseasonable hours.”“Nevertheless,” said the Pilgrim, in a commanding tone, “you will not, I think, refuse me that favour.”So saying, he stooped over the bed of the recumbent swineherd, and whispered something in his ear in Saxon. Gurth started up as ifelectriﬁed. The Pilgrim, raising his ﬁnger in an attitude as if to express caution, added, “Gurth, beware—thou are wont to be prudent. Isay, undo the postern—thou shalt know more anon.”With hasty alacrity Gurth obeyed him, while Wamba and the Jew followed, both wondering at the sudden change in the swineherd’sdemeanour. “My mule, my mule!” said the Jew, as soon as they stood without the postern.“Fetch him his mule,” said the Pilgrim; “and, hearest thou,—let me have another, that I may bear him company till he is beyondthese parts—I will return it safely to some of Cedric’s train at Ashby. And do thou”—he whispered the rest in Gurth’s ear.“Willingly, most willingly shall it be done,” said Gurth, and instantly departed to execute the commission.“I wish I knew,” said Wamba, when his comrade’s back was turned, “what you Palmers learn in the Holy Land.”“To say our orisons, fool,” answered the Pilgrim, “to repent our sins, and to mortify ourselves with fastings, vigils, and longprayers.”“Something more potent than that,” answered the Jester; “for when would repentance or prayer make Gurth do a courtesy, or fastingor vigil persuade him to lend you a mule?—I trow you might as well have told his favourite black boar of thy vigils and penance, andwouldst have gotten as civil an answer.”“Go to,” said the Pilgrim, “thou art but a Saxon fool.”“Thou sayst well,” said the Jester; “had I been born a Norman, as I think thou art, I would have had luck on my side, and been nextdoor to a wise man.”At this moment Gurth appeared on the opposite side of the moat with the mules. The travellers crossed the ditch upon a drawbridgeof only two planks breadth, the narrowness of which was matched with the straitness of the postern, and with a little wicket in theexterior palisade, which gave access to the forest. No sooner had they reached the mules, than the Jew, with hasty and tremblinghands, secured behind the saddle a small bag of blue buckram, which he took from under his cloak, containing, as he muttered, “achange of raiment—only a change of raiment.” Then getting upon the animal with more alacrity and haste than could have beenanticipated from his years, he lost no time in so disposing of the skirts of his gabardine as to conceal completely from observation theburden which he had thus deposited “en croupe”.The Pilgrim mounted with more deliberation, reaching, as he departed, his hand to Gurth, who kissed it with the utmost possibleveneration. The swineherd stood gazing after the travellers until they were lost under the boughs of the forest path, when he wasdisturbed from his reverie by the voice of Wamba.“Knowest thou,” said the Jester, “my good friend Gurth, that thou art strangely courteous and most unwontedly pious on thissummer morning? I would I were a black Prior or a barefoot Palmer, to avail myself of thy unwonted zeal and courtesy—certes, Iwould make more out of it than a kiss of the hand.”“Thou art no fool thus far, Wamba,” answered Gurth, “though thou arguest from appearances, and the wisest of us can do no more—But it is time to look after my charge.”So saying, he turned back to the mansion, attended by the Jester.Meanwhile the travellers continued to press on their journey with a dispatch which argued the extremity of the Jew’s fears, sincepersons at his age are seldom fond of rapid motion. The Palmer, to whom every path and outlet in the wood appeared to be familiar,led the way through the most devious paths, and more than once excited anew the suspicion of the Israelite, that he intended to betrayhim into some ambuscade of his enemies.His doubts might have been indeed pardoned; for, except perhaps the ﬂying ﬁsh, there was no race existing on the earth, in the air,or the waters, who were the object of such an unintermitting, general, and relentless persecution as the Jews of this period. Upon theslightest and most unreasonable pretences, as well as upon accusations the most absurd and groundless, their persons and propertywere exposed to every turn of popular fury; for Norman, Saxon, Dane, and Briton, however adverse these races were to each other,contended which should look with greatest detestation upon a people, whom it was accounted a point of religion to hate, to revile, todespise, to plunder, and to persecute. The kings of the Norman race, and the independent nobles, who followed their example in allacts of tyranny, maintained against this devoted people a persecution of a more regular, calculated, and self-interested kind. It is awell-known story of King John, that he conﬁned a wealthy Jew in one of the royal castles, and daily caused one of his teeth to be tornout, until, when the jaw of the unhappy Israelite was half disfurnished, he consented to pay a large sum, which it was the tyrant’sobject to extort from him. The little ready money which was in the country was chieﬂy in possession of this persecuted people, and thenobility hesitated not to follow the example of their sovereign, in wringing it from them by every species of oppression, and evenpersonal torture. Yet the passive courage inspired by the love of gain, induced the Jews to dare the various evils to which they weresubjected, in consideration of the immense proﬁts which they were enabled to realize in a country naturally so wealthy as England. Inspite of every kind of discouragement, and even of the special court of taxations already mentioned, called the Jews’ Exchequer,erected for the very purpose of despoiling and distressing them, the Jews increased, multiplied, and accumulated huge sums, whichthey transferred from one hand to another by means of bills of exchange—an invention for which commerce is said to be indebted tothem, and which enabled them to transfer their wealth from land to land, that when threatened with oppression in one country, theirtreasure might be secured in another.The obstinacy and avarice of the Jews being thus in a measure placed in opposition to the fanaticism that tyranny of those underwhom they lived, seemed to increase in proportion to the persecution with which they were visited; and the immense wealth theyusually acquired in commerce, while it frequently placed them in danger, was at other times used to extend their inﬂuence, and tosecure to them a certain degree of protection. On these terms they lived; and their character, inﬂuenced accordingly, was watchful,suspicious, and timid—yet obstinate, uncomplying, and skilful in evading the dangers to which they were exposed.When the travellers had pushed on at a rapid rate through many devious paths, the Palmer at length broke silence.“That large decayed oak,” he said, “marks the boundaries over which Front-de-Bœuf claims authority—we are long since far fromthose of Malvoisin. There is now no fear of pursuit.”“May the wheels of their chariots be taken off,” said the Jew, “like those of the host of Pharaoh, that they may drive heavily!—Butleave me not, good Pilgrim—Think but of that ﬁerce and savage Templar, with his Saracen slaves—they will regard neither territory,nor manor, nor lordship.”“Our road,” said the Palmer, “should here separate; for it beseems not men of my character and thine to travel together longer thanneeds must be. Besides, what succour couldst thou have from me, a peaceful Pilgrim, against two armed heathens?”“O good youth,” answered the Jew, “thou canst defend me, and I know thou wouldst. Poor as I am, I will requite it—not withmoney, for money, so help me my Father Abraham, I have none—but—-”“Money and recompense,” said the Palmer, interrupting him, “I have already said I require not of thee. Guide thee I can; and, it maybe, even in some sort defend thee; since to protect a Jew against a Saracen, can scarce be accounted unworthy of a Christian.Therefore, Jew, I will see thee safe under some ﬁtting escort. We are now not far from the town of Shefﬁeld, where thou mayest easilyﬁnd many of thy tribe with whom to take refuge.”“The blessing of Jacob be upon thee, good youth!” said the Jew; “in Shefﬁeld I can harbour with my kinsman Zareth, and ﬁnd somemeans of travelling forth with safety.”“Be it so,” said the Palmer; “at Shefﬁeld then we part, and half-an-hour’s riding will bring us in sight of that town.”The half hour was spent in perfect silence on both parts; the Pilgrim perhaps disdaining to address the Jew, except in case ofabsolute necessity, and the Jew not presuming to force a conversation with a person whose journey to the Holy Sepulchre gave a sortof sanctity to his character. They paused on the top of a gently rising bank, and the Pilgrim, pointing to the town of Shefﬁeld, whichlay beneath them, repeated the words, “Here, then, we part.”“Not till you have had the poor Jew’s thanks,” said Isaac; “for I presume not to ask you to go with me to my kinsman Zareth’s, whomight aid me with some means of repaying your good ofﬁces.”“I have already said,” answered the Pilgrim, “that I desire no recompense. If among the huge list of thy debtors, thou wilt, for mysake, spare the gyves and the dungeon to some unhappy Christian who stands in thy danger, I shall hold this morning’s service to theewell bestowed.”“Stay, stay,” said the Jew, laying hold of his garment; “something would I do more than this, something for thyself.—God knowsthe Jew is poor—yes, Isaac is the beggar of his tribe—but forgive me should I guess what thou most lackest at this moment.”“If thou wert to guess truly,” said the Palmer, “it is what thou canst not supply, wert thou as wealthy as thou sayst thou art poor.”“As I say?” echoed the Jew; “O! believe it, I say but the truth; I am a plundered, indebted, distressed man. Hard hands have wrungfrom me my goods, my money, my ships, and all that I possessed—Yet I can tell thee what thou lackest, and, it may be, supply it too.Thy wish even now is for a horse and armour.”The Palmer started, and turned suddenly towards the Jew:—“What ﬁend prompted that guess?” said he, hastily.“No matter,” said the Jew, smiling, “so that it be a true one—and, as I can guess thy want, so I can supply it.”“But consider,” said the Palmer, “my character, my dress, my vow.”“I know you Christians,” replied the Jew, “and that the noblest of you will take the staff and sandal in superstitious penance, andwalk afoot to visit the graves of dead men.”“Blaspheme not, Jew,” said the Pilgrim, sternly.“Forgive me,” said the Jew; “I spoke rashly. But there dropt words from you last night and this morning, that, like sparks from ﬂint,showed the metal within; and in the bosom of that Palmer’s gown, is hidden a knight’s chain and spurs of gold. They glanced as youstooped over my bed in the morning.”The Pilgrim could not forbear smiling. “Were thy garments searched by as curious an eye, Isaac,” said he, “what discoveries mightnot be made?”“No more of that,” said the Jew, changing colour; and drawing forth his writing materials in haste, as if to stop the conversation, hebegan to write upon a piece of paper which he supported on the top of his yellow cap, without dismounting from his mule. When hehad ﬁnished, he delivered the scroll, which was in the Hebrew character, to the Pilgrim, saying, “In the town of Leicester all menknow the rich Jew, Kirjath Jairam of Lombardy; give him this scroll—he hath on sale six Milan harnesses, the worst would suit acrowned head—ten goodly steeds, the worst might mount a king, were he to do battle for his throne. Of these he will give thee thychoice, with every thing else that can furnish thee forth for the tournament: when it is over, thou wilt return them safely—unless thoushouldst have wherewith to pay their value to the owner.”“But, Isaac,” said the Pilgrim, smiling, “dost thou know that in these sports, the arms and steed of the knight who is unhorsed areforfeit to his victor? Now I may be unfortunate, and so lose what I cannot replace or repay.”The Jew looked somewhat astounded at this possibility; but collecting his courage, he replied hastily. “No—no—no—It isimpossible—I will not think so. The blessing of Our Father will be upon thee. Thy lance will be powerful as the rod of Moses.”So saying, he was turning his mule’s head away, when the Palmer, in his turn, took hold of his gaberdine. “Nay, but Isaac, thouknowest not all the risk. The steed may be slain, the armour injured—for I will spare neither horse nor man. Besides, those of thy tribegive nothing for nothing; something there must be paid for their use.”The Jew twisted himself in the saddle, like a man in a ﬁt of the colic; but his better feelings predominated over those which weremost familiar to him. “I care not,” he said, “I care not—let me go. If there is damage, it will cost you nothing—if there is usagemoney, Kirjath Jairam will forgive it for the sake of his kinsman Isaac. Fare thee well!—Yet hark thee, good youth,” said he, turningabout, “thrust thyself not too forward into this vain hurly-burly—I speak not for endangering the steed, and coat of armour, but for thesake of thine own life and limbs.”“Gramercy for thy caution,” said the Palmer, again smiling; “I will use thy courtesy frankly, and it will go hard with me but I willrequite it.”They parted, and took different roads for the town of Shefﬁeld.CHAPTER VIIKnights, with a long retinue of their squires,In gaudy liveries march and quaint attires;One laced the helm, another held the lance,A third the shining buckler did advance.The courser paw’d the ground with restless feet,And snorting foam’d and champ’d the golden bit.The smiths and armourers on palfreys ride,Files in their hands, and hammers at their side;And nails for loosen’d spears, and thongs for shields provide.The yeomen guard the streets in seemly bands;And clowns come crowding on, with cudgels in their hands.PALAMON AND ARCITEThe condition of the English nation was at this time sufﬁciently miserable. King Richard was absent a prisoner, and in the power ofthe perﬁdious and cruel Duke of Austria. Even the very place of his captivity was uncertain, and his fate but very imperfectly knownto the generality of his subjects, who were, in the meantime, a prey to every species of subaltern oppression.Prince John, in league with Philip of France, Cœur-de-Lion’s mortal enemy, was using every species of inﬂuence with the Duke ofAustria, to prolong the captivity of his brother Richard, to whom he stood indebted for so many favours. In the meantime, he wasstrengthening his own faction in the kingdom, of which he proposed to dispute the succession, in case of the King’s death, with thelegitimate heir, Arthur Duke of Brittany, son of Geoffrey Plantagenet, the elder brother of John. This usurpation, it is well known, heafterwards effected. His own character being light, proﬂigate, and perﬁdious, John easily attached to his person and faction, not onlyall who had reason to dread the resentment of Richard for criminal proceedings during his absence, but also the numerous class of“lawless resolutes,” whom the crusades had turned back on their country, accomplished in the vices of the East, impoverished insubstance, and hardened in character, and who placed their hopes of harvest in civil commotion. To these causes of public distress andapprehension, must be added, the multitude of outlaws, who, driven to despair by the oppression of the feudal nobility, and the severeexercise of the forest laws, banded together in large gangs, and, keeping possession of the forests and the wastes, set at deﬁance thejustice and magistracy of the country. The nobles themselves, each fortiﬁed within his own castle, and playing the petty sovereign overhis own dominions, were the leaders of bands scarce less lawless and oppressive than those of the avowed depredators. To maintainthese retainers, and to support the extravagance and magniﬁcence which their pride induced them to affect, the nobility borrowed sumsof money from the Jews at the most usurious interest, which gnawed into their estates like consuming cankers, scarce to be curedunless when circumstances gave them an opportunity of getting free, by exercising upon their creditors some act of unprincipledviolence.Under the various burdens imposed by this unhappy state of affairs, the people of England suffered deeply for the present, and hadyet more dreadful cause to fear for the future. To augment their misery, a contagious disorder of a dangerous nature spread through theland; and, rendered more virulent by the uncleanness, the indifferent food, and the wretched lodging of the lower classes, swept offmany whose fate the survivors were tempted to envy, as exempting them from the evils which were to come.Yet amid these accumulated distresses, the poor as well as the rich, the vulgar as well as the noble, in the event of a tournament,which was the grand spectacle of that age, felt as much interested as the half-starved citizen of Madrid, who has not a real left to buyprovisions for his family, feels in the issue of a bull-feast. Neither duty nor inﬁrmity could keep youth or age from such exhibitions.The Passage of Arms, as it was called, which was to take place at Ashby, in the county of Leicester, as champions of the ﬁrst renownwere to take the ﬁeld in the presence of Prince John himself, who was expected to grace the lists, had attracted universal attention, andan immense conﬂuence of persons of all ranks hastened upon the appointed morning to the place of combat.The scene was singularly romantic. On the verge of a wood, which approached to within a mile of the town of Ashby, was anextensive meadow, of the ﬁnest and most beautiful green turf, surrounded on one side by the forest, and fringed on the other bystraggling oak-trees, some of which had grown to an immense size. The ground, as if fashioned on purpose for the martial displaywhich was intended, sloped gradually down on all sides to a level bottom, which was enclosed for the lists with strong palisades,forming a space of a quarter of a mile in length, and about half as broad. The form of the enclosure was an oblong square, save that thecorners were considerably rounded off, in order to afford more convenience for the spectators. The openings for the entry of thecombatants were at the northern and southern extremities of the lists, accessible by strong wooden gates, each wide enough to admittwo horsemen riding abreast. At each of these portals were stationed two heralds, attended by six trumpets, as many pursuivants, and astrong body of men-at-arms for maintaining order, and ascertaining the quality of the knights who proposed to engage in this martialgame.On a platform beyond the southern entrance, formed by a natural elevation of the ground, were pitched ﬁve magniﬁcent pavilions,adorned with pennons of russet and black, the chosen colours of the ﬁve knights challengers. The cords of the tents were of the samecolour. Before each pavilion was suspended the shield of the knight by whom it was occupied, and beside it stood his squire, quaintlydisguised as a salvage or silvan man, or in some other fantastic dress, according to the taste of his master, and the character he waspleased to assume during the game. 16The central pavilion, as the place of honour, had been assigned to Brian be Bois-Guilbert, whose renown in all games of chivalry, noless than his connexions with the knights who had undertaken this Passage of Arms, had occasioned him to be eagerly received intothe company of the challengers, and even adopted as their chief and leader, though he had so recently joined them. On one side of histent were pitched those of Reginald Front-de-Bœuf and Richard de Malvoisin, and on the other was the pavilion of Hugh deGrantmesnil, a noble baron in the vicinity, whose ancestor had been Lord High Steward of England in the time of the Conqueror, andhis son William Rufus. Ralph de Vipont, a knight of St John of Jerusalem, who had some ancient possessions at a place called Heather,near Ashby-de-la-Zouche, occupied the ﬁfth pavilion. From the entrance into the lists, a gently sloping passage, ten yards in breadth,led up to the platform on which the tents were pitched. It was strongly secured by a palisade on each side, as was the esplanade infront of the pavilions, and the whole was guarded by men-at-arms.The northern access to the lists terminated in a similar entrance of thirty feet in breadth, at the extremity of which was a largeenclosed space for such knights as might be disposed to enter the lists with the challengers, behind which were placed tents containingrefreshments of every kind for their accommodation, with armourers, tarriers, and other attendants, in readiness to give their serviceswherever they might be necessary.The exterior of the lists was in part occupied by temporary galleries, spread with tapestry and carpets, and accommodated withcushions for the convenience of those ladies and nobles who were expected to attend the tournament. A narrow space, betwixt thesegalleries and the lists, gave accommodation for yeomanry and spectators of a better degree than the mere vulgar, and might becompared to the pit of a theatre. The promiscuous multitude arranged themselves upon large banks of turf prepared for the purpose,which, aided by the natural elevation of the ground, enabled them to overlook the galleries, and obtain a fair view into the lists.Besides the accommodation which these stations afforded, many hundreds had perched themselves on the branches of the trees whichsurrounded the meadow; and even the steeple of a country church, at some distance, was crowded with spectators.It only remains to notice respecting the general arrangement, that one gallery in the very centre of the eastern side of the lists, andconsequently exactly opposite to the spot where the shock of the combat was to take place, was raised higher than the others, morerichly decorated, and graced by a sort of throne and canopy, on which the royal arms were emblazoned. Squires, pages, and yeomen inrich liveries, waited around this place of honour, which was designed for Prince John and his attendants. Opposite to this royal gallerywas another, elevated to the same height, on the western side of the lists; and more gaily, if less sumptuously decorated, than thatdestined for the Prince himself. A train of pages and of young maidens, the most beautiful who could be selected, gaily dressed infancy habits of green and pink, surrounded a throne decorated in the same colours. Among pennons and ﬂags bearing wounded hearts,burning hearts, bleeding hearts, bows and quivers, and all the commonplace emblems of the triumphs of Cupid, a blazoned inscriptioninformed the spectators, that this seat of honour was designed for “La Royne de las Beaulte et des Amours”. But who was to representthe Queen of Beauty and of Love on the present occasion no one was prepared to guess.Meanwhile, spectators of every description thronged forward to occupy their respective stations, and not without many quarrelsconcerning those which they were entitled to hold. Some of these were settled by the men-at-arms with brief ceremony; the shafts oftheir battle-axes, and pummels of their swords, being readily employed as arguments to convince the more refractory. Others, whichinvolved the rival claims of more elevated persons, were determined by the heralds, or by the two marshals of the ﬁeld, William deWyvil, and Stephen de Martival, who, armed at all points, rode up and down the lists to enforce and preserve good order among thespectators.Gradually the galleries became ﬁlled with knights and nobles, in their robes of peace, whose long and rich-tinted mantles werecontrasted with the gayer and more splendid habits of the ladies, who, in a greater proportion than even the men themselves, throngedto witness a sport, which one would have thought too bloody and dangerous to afford their sex much pleasure. The lower and interiorspace was soon ﬁlled by substantial yeomen and burghers, and such of the lesser gentry, as, from modesty, poverty, or dubious title,durst not assume any higher place. It was of course amongst these that the most frequent disputes for precedence occurred.“Dog of an unbeliever,” said an old man, whose threadbare tunic bore witness to his poverty, as his sword, and dagger, and goldenchain intimated his pretensions to rank,—“whelp of a she-wolf! darest thou press upon a Christian, and a Norman gentleman of theblood of Montdidier?”This rough expostulation was addressed to no other than our acquaintance Isaac, who, richly and even magniﬁcently dressed in agaberdine ornamented with lace and lined with fur, was endeavouring to make place in the foremost row beneath the gallery for hisdaughter, the beautiful Rebecca, who had joined him at Ashby, and who was now hanging on her father’s arm, not a little terriﬁed bythe popular displeasure which seemed generally excited by her parent’s presumption. But Isaac, though we have seen him sufﬁcientlytimid on other occasions, knew well that at present he had nothing to fear. It was not in places of general resort, or where their equalswere assembled, that any avaricious or malevolent noble durst offer him injury. At such meetings the Jews were under the protectionof the general law; and if that proved a weak assurance, it usually happened that there were among the persons assembled somebarons, who, for their own interested motives, were ready to act as their protectors. On the present occasion, Isaac felt more thanusually conﬁdent, being aware that Prince John was even then in the very act of negotiating a large loan from the Jews of York, to besecured upon certain jewels and lands. Isaac’s own share in this transaction was considerable, and he well knew that the Prince’s eagerdesire to bring it to a conclusion would ensure him his protection in the dilemma in which he stood.Emboldened by these considerations, the Jew pursued his point, and jostled the Norman Christian, without respect either to hisdescent, quality, or religion. The complaints of the old man, however, excited the indignation of the bystanders. One of these, a stoutwell-set yeoman, arrayed in Lincoln green, having twelve arrows stuck in his belt, with a baldric and badge of silver, and a bow of sixfeet length in his hand, turned short round, and while his countenance, which his constant exposure to weather had rendered brown asa hazel nut, grew darker with anger, he advised the Jew to remember that all the wealth he had acquired by sucking the blood of hismiserable victims had but swelled him like a bloated spider, which might be overlooked while he kept in a corner, but would becrushed if it ventured into the light. This intimation, delivered in Norman-English with a ﬁrm voice and a stern aspect, made the Jewshrink back; and he would have probably withdrawn himself altogether from a vicinity so dangerous, had not the attention of everyone been called to the sudden entrance of Prince John, who at that moment entered the lists, attended by a numerous and gay train,consisting partly of laymen, partly of churchmen, as light in their dress, and as gay in their demeanour, as their companions. Amongthe latter was the Prior of Jorvaulx, in the most gallant trim which a dignitary of the church could venture to exhibit. Fur and goldwere not spared in his garments; and the points of his boots, out-heroding the preposterous fashion of the time, turned up so very far,as to be attached, not to his knees merely, but to his very girdle, and effectually prevented him from putting his foot into the stirrup.This, however, was a slight inconvenience to the gallant Abbot, who, perhaps, even rejoicing in the opportunity to display hisaccomplished horsemanship before so many spectators, especially of the fair sex, dispensed with the use of these supports to a timidrider. The rest of Prince John’s retinue consisted of the favourite leaders of his mercenary troops, some marauding barons andproﬂigate attendants upon the court, with several Knights Templars and Knights of St John.It may be here remarked, that the knights of these two orders were accounted hostile to King Richard, having adopted the side ofPhilip of France in the long train of disputes which took place in Palestine betwixt that monarch and the lion-hearted King of England.It was the well-known consequence of this discord that Richard’s repeated victories had been rendered fruitless, his romantic attemptsto besiege Jerusalem disappointed, and the fruit of all the glory which he had acquired had dwindled into an uncertain truce with theSultan Saladin. With the same policy which had dictated the conduct of their brethren in the Holy Land, the Templars and Hospitallersin England and Normandy attached themselves to the faction of Prince John, having little reason to desire the return of Richard toEngland, or the succession of Arthur, his legitimate heir. For the opposite reason, Prince John hated and contemned the few Saxonfamilies of consequence which subsisted in England, and omitted no opportunity of mortifying and affronting them; being consciousthat his person and pretensions were disliked by them, as well as by the greater part of the English commons, who feared fartherinnovation upon their rights and liberties, from a sovereign of John’s licentious and tyrannical disposition.Attended by this gallant equipage, himself well mounted, and splendidly dressed in crimson and in gold, bearing upon his hand afalcon, and having his head covered by a rich fur bonnet, adorned with a circle of precious stones, from which his long curled hairescaped and overspread his shoulders, Prince John, upon a grey and high-mettled palfrey, caracoled within the lists at the head of hisjovial party, laughing loud with his train, and eyeing with all the boldness of royal criticism the beauties who adorned the loftygalleries.Those who remarked in the physiognomy of the Prince a dissolute audacity, mingled with extreme haughtiness and indifference tothe feelings of others could not yet deny to his countenance that sort of comeliness which belongs to an open set of features, wellformed by nature, modelled by art to the usual rules of courtesy, yet so far frank and honest, that they seemed as if they disclaimed toconceal the natural workings of the soul. Such an expression is often mistaken for manly frankness, when in truth it arises from thereckless indifference of a libertine disposition, conscious of superiority of birth, of wealth, or of some other adventitious advantage,totally unconnected with personal merit. To those who did not think so deeply, and they were the greater number by a hundred to one,the splendour of Prince John’s “rheno”, (i.e. fur tippet,) the richness of his cloak, lined with the most costly sables, his maroquin bootsand golden spurs, together with the grace with which he managed his palfrey, were sufﬁcient to merit clamorous applause.In his joyous caracole round the lists, the attention of the Prince was called by the commotion, not yet subsided, which had attendedthe ambitious movement of Isaac towards the higher places of the assembly. The quick eye of Prince John instantly recognised theJew, but was much more agreeably attracted by the beautiful daughter of Zion, who, terriﬁed by the tumult, clung close to the arm ofher aged father.The ﬁgure of Rebecca might indeed have compared with the proudest beauties of England, even though it had been judged by asshrewd a connoisseur as Prince John. Her form was exquisitely symmetrical, and was shown to advantage by a sort of Eastern dress,which she wore according to the fashion of the females of her nation. Her turban of yellow silk suited well with the darkness of hercomplexion. The brilliancy of her eyes, the superb arch of her eyebrows, her well-formed aquiline nose, her teeth as white as pearl,and the profusion of her sable tresses, which, each arranged in its own little spiral of twisted curls, fell down upon as much of a lovelyneck and bosom as a simarre of the richest Persian silk, exhibiting ﬂowers in their natural colours embossed upon a purple ground,permitted to be visible—all these constituted a combination of loveliness, which yielded not to the most beautiful of the maidens whosurrounded her. It is true, that of the golden and pearl-studded clasps, which closed her vest from the throat to the waist, the threeuppermost were left unfastened on account of the heat, which somewhat enlarged the prospect to which we allude. A diamondnecklace, with pendants of inestimable value, were by this means also made more conspicuous. The feather of an ostrich, fastened inher turban by an agraffe set with brilliants, was another distinction of the beautiful Jewess, scoffed and sneered at by the proud dameswho sat above her, but secretly envied by those who affected to deride them.“By the bald scalp of Abraham,” said Prince John, “yonder Jewess must be the very model of that perfection, whose charms drovefrantic the wisest king that ever lived! What sayest thou, Prior Aymer?—By the Temple of that wise king, which our wiser brotherRichard proved unable to recover, she is the very Bride of the Canticles!”“The Rose of Sharon and the Lily of the Valley,”—answered the Prior, in a sort of snufﬂing tone; “but your Grace must remembershe is still but a Jewess.”“Ay!” added Prince John, without heeding him, “and there is my Mammon of unrighteousness too—the Marquis of Marks, theBaron of Byzants, contesting for place with penniless dogs, whose threadbare cloaks have not a single cross in their pouches to keepthe devil from dancing there. By the body of St Mark, my prince of supplies, with his lovely Jewess, shall have a place in the gallery!—What is she, Isaac? Thy wife or thy daughter, that Eastern houri that thou lockest under thy arm as thou wouldst thy treasure-casket?”“My daughter Rebecca, so please your Grace,” answered Isaac, with a low congee, nothing embarrassed by the Prince’s salutation,in which, however, there was at least as much mockery as courtesy.“The wiser man thou,” said John, with a peal of laughter, in which his gay followers obsequiously joined. “But, daughter or wife,she should be preferred according to her beauty and thy merits.—Who sits above there?” he continued, bending his eye on the gallery.“Saxon churls, lolling at their lazy length!—out upon them!—let them sit close, and make room for my prince of usurers and hislovely daughter. I’ll make the hinds know they must share the high places of the synagogue with those whom the synagogue properlybelongs to.”Those who occupied the gallery to whom this injurious and unpolite speech was addressed, were the family of Cedric the Saxon,with that of his ally and kinsman, Athelstane of Coningsburgh, a personage, who, on account of his descent from the last Saxonmonarchs of England, was held in the highest respect by all the Saxon natives of the north of England. But with the blood of thisancient royal race, many of their inﬁrmities had descended to Athelstane. He was comely in countenance, bulky and strong in person,and in the ﬂower of his age—yet inanimate in expression, dull-eyed, heavy-browed, inactive and sluggish in all his motions, and soslow in resolution, that the soubriquet of one of his ancestors was conferred upon him, and he was very generally called Athelstane theUnready. His friends, and he had many, who, as well as Cedric, were passionately attached to him, contended that this sluggish temperarose not from want of courage, but from mere want of decision; others alleged that his hereditary vice of drunkenness had obscuredhis faculties, never of a very acute order, and that the passive courage and meek good-nature which remained behind, were merely thedregs of a character that might have been deserving of praise, but of which all the valuable parts had ﬂown off in the progress of a longcourse of brutal debauchery.It was to this person, such as we have described him, that the Prince addressed his imperious command to make place for Isaac andRebecca. Athelstane, utterly confounded at an order which the manners and feelings of the times rendered so injuriously insulting,unwilling to obey, yet undetermined how to resist, opposed only the “vis inertiae” to the will of John; and, without stirring or makingany motion whatever of obedience, opened his large grey eyes, and stared at the Prince with an astonishment which had in itsomething extremely ludicrous. But the impatient John regarded it in no such light.“The Saxon porker,” he said, “is either asleep or minds me not—Prick him with your lance, De Bracy,” speaking to a knight whorode near him, the leader of a band of Free Companions, or Condottieri; that is, of mercenaries belonging to no particular nation, butattached for the time to any prince by whom they were paid. There was a murmur even among the attendants of Prince John; but DeBracy, whose profession freed him from all scruples, extended his long lance over the space which separated the gallery from the lists,and would have executed the commands of the Prince before Athelstane the Unready had recovered presence of mind sufﬁcient evento draw back his person from the weapon, had not Cedric, as prompt as his companion was tardy, unsheathed, with the speed oflightning, the short sword which he wore, and at a single blow severed the point of the lance from the handle. The blood rushed intothe countenance of Prince John. He swore one of his deepest oaths, and was about to utter some threat corresponding in violence,when he was diverted from his purpose, partly by his own attendants, who gathered around him conjuring him to be patient, partly bya general exclamation of the crowd, uttered in loud applause of the spirited conduct of Cedric. The Prince rolled his eyes inindignation, as if to collect some safe and easy victim; and chancing to encounter the ﬁrm glance of the same archer whom we havealready noticed, and who seemed to persist in his gesture of applause, in spite of the frowning aspect which the Prince bent upon him,he demanded his reason for clamouring thus.“I always add my hollo,” said the yeoman, “when I see a good shot, or a gallant blow.”“Sayst thou?” answered the Prince; “then thou canst hit the white thyself, I’ll warrant.”“A woodsman’s mark, and at woodsman’s distance, I can hit,” answered the yeoman.“And Wat Tyrrel’s mark, at a hundred yards,” said a voice from behind, but by whom uttered could not be discerned.This allusion to the fate of William Rufus, his Relative, at once incensed and alarmed Prince John. He satisﬁed himself, however,with commanding the men-at-arms, who surrounded the lists, to keep an eye on the braggart, pointing to the yeoman.“By St Grizzel,” he added, “we will try his own skill, who is so ready to give his voice to the feats of others!”“I shall not ﬂy the trial,” said the yeoman, with the composure which marked his whole deportment.“Meanwhile, stand up, ye Saxon churls,” said the ﬁery Prince; “for, by the light of Heaven, since I have said it, the Jew shall havehis seat amongst ye!”“By no means, an it please your Grace!—it is not ﬁt for such as we to sit with the rulers of the land,” said the Jew; whose ambitionfor precedence though it had led him to dispute Place with the extenuated and impoverished descendant of the line of Montdidier, byno means stimulated him to an intrusion upon the privileges of the wealthy Saxons.“Up, inﬁdel dog when I command you,” said Prince John, “or I will have thy swarthy hide stript off, and tanned for horse-furniture.”Thus urged, the Jew began to ascend the steep and narrow steps which led up to the gallery.“Let me see,” said the Prince, “who dare stop him,” ﬁxing his eye on Cedric, whose attitude intimated his intention to hurl the Jewdown headlong.The catastrophe was prevented by the clown Wamba, who, springing betwixt his master and Isaac, and exclaiming, in answer to thePrince’s deﬁance, “Marry, that will I!” opposed to the beard of the Jew a shield of brawn, which he plucked from beneath his cloak,and with which, doubtless, he had furnished himself, lest the tournament should have proved longer than his appetite could endureabstinence. Finding the abomination of his tribe opposed to his very nose, while the Jester, at the same time, ﬂourished his woodensword above his head, the Jew recoiled, missed his footing, and rolled down the steps,—an excellent jest to the spectators, who set upa loud laughter, in which Prince John and his attendants heartily joined.“Deal me the prize, cousin Prince,” said Wamba; “I have vanquished my foe in fair ﬁght with sword and shield,” he added,brandishing the brawn in one hand and the wooden sword in the other.“Who, and what art thou, noble champion?” said Prince John, still laughing.“A fool by right of descent,” answered the Jester; “I am Wamba, the son of Witless, who was the son of Weatherbrain, who was theson of an Alderman.”“Make room for the Jew in front of the lower ring,” said Prince John, not unwilling perhaps to seize an apology to desist from hisoriginal purpose; “to place the vanquished beside the victor were false heraldry.”“Knave upon fool were worse,” answered the Jester, “and Jew upon bacon worst of all.”“Gramercy! good fellow,” cried Prince John, “thou pleasest me—Here, Isaac, lend me a handful of byzants.”As the Jew, stunned by the request, afraid to refuse, and unwilling to comply, fumbled in the furred bag which hung by his girdle,and was perhaps endeavouring to ascertain how few coins might pass for a handful, the Prince stooped from his jennet and settledIsaac’s doubts by snatching the pouch itself from his side; and ﬂinging to Wamba a couple of the gold pieces which it contained, hepursued his career round the lists, leaving the Jew to the derision of those around him, and himself receiving as much applause fromthe spectators as if he had done some honest and honourable action.CHAPTER VIIIAt this the challenger with ﬁerce defyHis trumpet sounds; the challenged makes reply:With clangour rings the ﬁeld, resounds the vaulted sky.Their visors closed, their lances in the rest,Or at the helmet pointed or the crest,They vanish from the barrier, speed the race,And spurring see decrease the middle space.PALAMON AND ARCITEIn the midst of Prince John’s cavalcade, he suddenly stopt, and appealing to the Prior of Jorvaulx, declared the principal business ofthe day had been forgotten.“By my halidom,” said he, “we have forgotten, Sir Prior, to name the fair Sovereign of Love and of Beauty, by whose white handthe palm is to be distributed. For my part, I am liberal in my ideas, and I care not if I give my vote for the black-eyed Rebecca.”“Holy Virgin,” answered the Prior, turning up his eyes in horror, “a Jewess!—We should deserve to be stoned out of the lists; and Iam not yet old enough to be a martyr. Besides, I swear by my patron saint, that she is far inferior to the lovely Saxon, Rowena.”“Saxon or Jew,” answered the Prince, “Saxon or Jew, dog or hog, what matters it? I say, name Rebecca, were it only to mortify theSaxon churls.”A murmur arose even among his own immediate attendants.“This passes a jest, my lord,” said De Bracy; “no knight here will lay lance in rest if such an insult is attempted.”“It is the mere wantonness of insult,” said one of the oldest and most important of Prince John’s followers, Waldemar Fitzurse, “andif your Grace attempt it, cannot but prove ruinous to your projects.”“I entertained you, sir,” said John, reining up his palfrey haughtily, “for my follower, but not for my counsellor.”“Those who follow your Grace in the paths which you tread,” said Waldemar, but speaking in a low voice, “acquire the right ofcounsellors; for your interest and safety are not more deeply gaged than their own.”From the tone in which this was spoken, John saw the necessity of acquiescence. “I did but jest,” he said; “and you turn upon melike so many adders! Name whom you will, in the ﬁend’s name, and please yourselves.”“Nay, nay,” said De Bracy, “let the fair sovereign’s throne remain unoccupied, until the conqueror shall be named, and then let himchoose the lady by whom it shall be ﬁlled. It will add another grace to his triumph, and teach fair ladies to prize the love of valiantknights, who can exalt them to such distinction.”“If Brian de Bois-Guilbert gain the prize,” said the Prior, “I will gage my rosary that I name the Sovereign of Love and Beauty.”“Bois-Guilbert,” answered De Bracy, “is a good lance; but there are others around these lists, Sir Prior, who will not fear toencounter him.”“Silence, sirs,” said Waldemar, “and let the Prince assume his seat. The knights and spectators are alike impatient, the timeadvances, and highly ﬁt it is that the sports should commence.”Prince John, though not yet a monarch, had in Waldemar Fitzurse all the inconveniences of a favourite minister, who, in serving hissovereign, must always do so in his own way. The Prince acquiesced, however, although his disposition was precisely of that kindwhich is apt to be obstinate upon triﬂes, and, assuming his throne, and being surrounded by his followers, gave signal to the heralds toproclaim the laws of the tournament, which were brieﬂy as follows:First, the ﬁve challengers were to undertake all comers.Secondly, any knight proposing to combat, might, if he pleased, select a special antagonist from among the challengers, by touchinghis shield. If he did so with the reverse of his lance, the trial of skill was made with what were called the arms of courtesy, that is, withlances at whose extremity a piece of round ﬂat board was ﬁxed, so that no danger was encountered, save from the shock of the horsesand riders. But if the shield was touched with the sharp end of the lance, the combat was understood to be at “outrance”, that is, theknights were to ﬁght with sharp weapons, as in actual battle.Thirdly, when the knights present had accomplished their vow, by each of them breaking ﬁve lances, the Prince was to declare thevictor in the ﬁrst day’s tourney, who should receive as prize a warhorse of exquisite beauty and matchless strength; and in addition tothis reward of valour, it was now declared, he should have the peculiar honour of naming the Queen of Love and Beauty, by whom theprize should be given on the ensuing day.Fourthly, it was announced, that, on the second day, there should be a general tournament, in which all the knights present, whowere desirous to win praise, might take part; and being divided into two bands of equal numbers, might ﬁght it out manfully, until thesignal was given by Prince John to cease the combat. The elected Queen of Love and Beauty was then to crown the knight whom thePrince should adjudge to have borne himself best in this second day, with a coronet composed of thin gold plate, cut into the shape ofa laurel crown. On this second day the knightly games ceased. But on that which was to follow, feats of archery, of bull-baiting, andother popular amusements, were to be practised, for the more immediate amusement of the populace. In this manner did Prince Johnendeavour to lay the foundation of a popularity, which he was perpetually throwing down by some inconsiderate act of wantonaggression upon the feelings and prejudices of the people.The lists now presented a most splendid spectacle. The sloping galleries were crowded with all that was noble, great, wealthy, andbeautiful in the northern and midland parts of England; and the contrast of the various dresses of these digniﬁed spectators, renderedthe view as gay as it was rich, while the interior and lower space, ﬁlled with the substantial burgesses and yeomen of merry England,formed, in their more plain attire, a dark fringe, or border, around this circle of brilliant embroidery, relieving, and, at the same time,formed, in their more plain attire, a dark fringe, or border, around this circle of brilliant embroidery, relieving, and, at the same time,setting off its splendour.The heralds ﬁnished their proclamation with their usual cry of “Largesse, largesse, gallant knights!” and gold and silver pieces wereshowered on them from the galleries, it being a high point of chivalry to exhibit liberality towards those whom the age accounted atonce the secretaries and the historians of honour. The bounty of the spectators was acknowledged by the customary shouts of “Love ofLadies—Death of Champions—Honour to the Generous—Glory to the Brave!” To which the more humble spectators added theiracclamations, and a numerous band of trumpeters the ﬂourish of their martial instruments. When these sounds had ceased, the heraldswithdrew from the lists in gay and glittering procession, and none remained within them save the marshals of the ﬁeld, who, armedcap-a-pie, sat on horseback, motionless as statues, at the opposite ends of the lists. Meantime, the enclosed space at the northernextremity of the lists, large as it was, was now completely crowded with knights desirous to prove their skill against the challengers,and, when viewed from the galleries, presented the appearance of a sea of waving plumage, intermixed with glistening helmets, andtall lances, to the extremities of which were, in many cases, attached small pennons of about a span’s breadth, which, ﬂuttering in theair as the breeze caught them, joined with the restless motion of the feathers to add liveliness to the scene.At length the barriers were opened, and ﬁve knights, chosen by lot, advanced slowly into the area; a single champion riding in front,and the other four following in pairs. All were splendidly armed, and my Saxon authority (in the Wardour Manuscript) records at greatlength their devices, their colours, and the embroidery of their horse trappings. It is unnecessary to be particular on these subjects. Toborrow lines from a contemporary poet, who has written but too little:“The knights are dust,And their good swords are rust,Their souls are with the saints, we trust.” 17Their escutcheons have long mouldered from the walls of their castles. Their castles themselves are but green mounds and shatteredruins—the place that once knew them, knows them no more—nay, many a race since theirs has died out and been forgotten in the veryland which they occupied, with all the authority of feudal proprietors and feudal lords. What, then, would it avail the reader to knowtheir names, or the evanescent symbols of their martial rank!Now, however, no whit anticipating the oblivion which awaited their names and feats, the champions advanced through the lists,restraining their ﬁery steeds, and compelling them to move slowly, while, at the same time, they exhibited their paces, together withthe grace and dexterity of the riders. As the procession entered the lists, the sound of a wild Barbaric music was heard from behind thetents of the challengers, where the performers were concealed. It was of Eastern origin, having been brought from the Holy Land; andthe mixture of the cymbals and bells seemed to bid welcome at once, and deﬁance, to the knights as they advanced. With the eyes ofan immense concourse of spectators ﬁxed upon them, the ﬁve knights advanced up the platform upon which the tents of thechallengers stood, and there separating themselves, each touched slightly, and with the reverse of his lance, the shield of the antagonistto whom he wished to oppose himself. The lower orders of spectators in general—nay, many of the higher class, and it is even saidseveral of the ladies, were rather disappointed at the champions choosing the arms of courtesy. For the same sort of persons, who, inthe present day, applaud most highly the deepest tragedies, were then interested in a tournament exactly in proportion to the dangerincurred by the champions engaged.Having intimated their more paciﬁc purpose, the champions retreated to the extremity of the lists, where they remained drawn up ina line; while the challengers, sallying each from his pavilion, mounted their horses, and, headed by Brian de Bois-Guilbert, descendedfrom the platform, and opposed themselves individually to the knights who had touched their respective shields.At the ﬂourish of clarions and trumpets, they started out against each other at full gallop; and such was the superior dexterity orgood fortune of the challengers, that those opposed to Bois-Guilbert, Malvoisin, and Front-de-Bœuf, rolled on the ground. Theantagonist of Grantmesnil, instead of bearing his lance-point fair against the crest or the shield of his enemy, swerved so much fromthe direct line as to break the weapon athwart the person of his opponent—a circumstance which was accounted more disgraceful thanthat of being actually unhorsed; because the latter might happen from accident, whereas the former evinced awkwardness and want ofmanagement of the weapon and of the horse. The ﬁfth knight alone maintained the honour of his party, and parted fairly with theKnight of St John, both splintering their lances without advantage on either side.The shouts of the multitude, together with the acclamations of the heralds, and the clangour of the trumpets, announced the triumphof the victors and the defeat of the vanquished. The former retreated to their pavilions, and the latter, gathering themselves up as theycould, withdrew from the lists in disgrace and dejection, to agree with their victors concerning the redemption of their arms and theirhorses, which, according to the laws of the tournament, they had forfeited. The ﬁfth of their number alone tarried in the lists longenough to be greeted by the applauses of the spectators, amongst whom he retreated, to the aggravation, doubtless, of his companions’mortiﬁcation.A second and a third party of knights took the ﬁeld; and although they had various success, yet, upon the whole, the advantagedecidedly remained with the challengers, not one of whom lost his seat or swerved from his charge—misfortunes which befell one ortwo of their antagonists in each encounter. The spirits, therefore, of those opposed to them, seemed to be considerably damped by theircontinued success. Three knights only appeared on the fourth entry, who, avoiding the shields of Bois-Guilbert and Front-de-Bœuf,contented themselves with touching those of the three other knights, who had not altogether manifested the same strength anddexterity. This politic selection did not alter the fortune of the ﬁeld, the challengers were still successful: one of their antagonists wasoverthrown, and both the others failed in the “attaint”, 18 that is, in striking the helmet and shield of their antagonist ﬁrmly andstrongly, with the lance held in a direct line, so that the weapon might break unless the champion was overthrown.After this fourth encounter, there was a considerable pause; nor did it appear that any one was very desirous of renewing the contest.The spectators murmured among themselves; for, among the challengers, Malvoisin and Front-de-Bœuf were unpopular from theircharacters, and the others, except Grantmesnil, were disliked as strangers and foreigners.But none shared the general feeling of dissatisfaction so keenly as Cedric the Saxon, who saw, in each advantage gained by theNorman challengers, a repeated triumph over the honour of England. His own education had taught him no skill in the games ofchivalry, although, with the arms of his Saxon ancestors, he had manifested himself, on many occasions, a brave and determinedsoldier. He looked anxiously to Athelstane, who had learned the accomplishments of the age, as if desiring that he should make somepersonal effort to recover the victory which was passing into the hands of the Templar and his associates. But, though both stout ofheart, and strong of person, Athelstane had a disposition too inert and unambitious to make the exertions which Cedric seemed toexpect from him.“The day is against England, my lord,” said Cedric, in a marked tone; “are you not tempted to take the lance?”“I shall tilt to-morrow” answered Athelstane, “in the ‘melee’; it is not worth while for me to arm myself to-day.”Two things displeased Cedric in this speech. It contained the Norman word “melee”, (to express the general conﬂict,) and it evincedsome indifference to the honour of the country; but it was spoken by Athelstane, whom he held in such profound respect, that hewould not trust himself to canvass his motives or his foibles. Moreover, he had no time to make any remark, for Wamba thrust in hisword, observing, “It was better, though scarce easier, to be the best man among a hundred, than the best man of two.”Athelstane took the observation as a serious compliment; but Cedric, who better understood the Jester’s meaning, darted at him asevere and menacing look; and lucky it was for Wamba, perhaps, that the time and place prevented his receiving, notwithstanding hisplace and service, more sensible marks of his master’s resentment.The pause in the tournament was still uninterrupted, excepting by the voices of the heralds exclaiming—“Love of ladies, splinteringof lances! stand forth gallant knights, fair eyes look upon your deeds!”The music also of the challengers breathed from time to time wild bursts expressive of triumph or deﬁance, while the clownsgrudged a holiday which seemed to pass away in inactivity; and old knights and nobles lamented in whispers the decay of martialspirit, spoke of the triumphs of their younger days, but agreed that the land did not now supply dames of such transcendent beauty ashad animated the jousts of former times. Prince John began to talk to his attendants about making ready the banquet, and the necessityof adjudging the prize to Brian de Bois-Guilbert, who had, with a single spear, overthrown two knights, and foiled a third.At length, as the Saracenic music of the challengers concluded one of those long and high ﬂourishes with which they had broken thesilence of the lists, it was answered by a solitary trumpet, which breathed a note of deﬁance from the northern extremity. All eyes wereturned to see the new champion which these sounds announced, and no sooner were the barriers opened than he paced into the lists.As far as could be judged of a man sheathed in armour, the new adventurer did not greatly exceed the middle size, and seemed to berather slender than strongly made. His suit of armour was formed of steel, richly inlaid with gold, and the device on his shield was ayoung oak-tree pulled up by the roots, with the Spanish word Desdichado, signifying Disinherited. He was mounted on a gallant blackhorse, and as he passed through the lists he gracefully saluted the Prince and the ladies by lowering his lance. The dexterity withwhich he managed his steed, and something of youthful grace which he displayed in his manner, won him the favour of the multitude,which some of the lower classes expressed by calling out, “Touch Ralph de Vipont’s shield—touch the Hospitallers shield; he has theleast sure seat, he is your cheapest bargain.”The champion, moving onward amid these well-meant hints, ascended the platform by the sloping alley which led to it from thelists, and, to the astonishment of all present, riding straight up to the central pavilion, struck with the sharp end of his spear the shieldof Brian de Bois-Guilbert until it rung again. All stood astonished at his presumption, but none more than the redoubted Knight whomhe had thus deﬁed to mortal combat, and who, little expecting so rude a challenge, was standing carelessly at the door of the pavilion.“Have you confessed yourself, brother,” said the Templar, “and have you heard mass this morning, that you peril your life sofrankly?”“I am ﬁtter to meet death than thou art” answered the Disinherited Knight; for by this name the stranger had recorded himself in thebooks of the tourney.“Then take your place in the lists,” said Bois-Guilbert, “and look your last upon the sun; for this night thou shalt sleep in paradise.”“Gramercy for thy courtesy,” replied the Disinherited Knight, “and to requite it, I advise thee to take a fresh horse and a new lance,for by my honour you will need both.”Having expressed himself thus conﬁdently, he reined his horse backward down the slope which he had ascended, and compelledhim in the same manner to move backward through the lists, till he reached the northern extremity, where he remained stationary, inexpectation of his antagonist. This feat of horsemanship again attracted the applause of the multitude.However incensed at his adversary for the precautions which he recommended, Brian de Bois-Guilbert did not neglect his advice;for his honour was too nearly concerned, to permit his neglecting any means which might ensure victory over his presumptuousopponent. He changed his horse for a proved and fresh one of great strength and spirit. He chose a new and a tough spear, lest thewood of the former might have been strained in the previous encounters he had sustained. Lastly, he laid aside his shield, which hadreceived some little damage, and received another from his squires. His ﬁrst had only borne the general device of his rider,representing two knights riding upon one horse, an emblem expressive of the original humility and poverty of the Templars, qualitieswhich they had since exchanged for the arrogance and wealth that ﬁnally occasioned their suppression. Bois-Guilbert’s new shieldbore a raven in full ﬂight, holding in its claws a skull, and bearing the motto, “Gare le Corbeau”.When the two champions stood opposed to each other at the two extremities of the lists, the public expectation was strained to thehighest pitch. Few augured the possibility that the encounter could terminate well for the Disinherited Knight, yet his courage andgallantry secured the general good wishes of the spectators.The trumpets had no sooner given the signal, than the champions vanished from their posts with the speed of lightning, and closedin the centre of the lists with the shock of a thunderbolt. The lances burst into shivers up to the very grasp, and it seemed at themoment that both knights had fallen, for the shock had made each horse recoil backwards upon its haunches. The address of the ridersrecovered their steeds by use of the bridle and spur; and having glared on each other for an instant with eyes which seemed to ﬂash ﬁrethrough the bars of their visors, each made a demi-volte, and, retiring to the extremity of the lists, received a fresh lance from theattendants.A loud shout from the spectators, waving of scarfs and handkerchiefs, and general acclamations, attested the interest taken by thespectators in this encounter; the most equal, as well as the best performed, which had graced the day. But no sooner had the knightsresumed their station, than the clamour of applause was hushed into a silence, so deep and so dead, that it seemed the multitude wereafraid even to breathe.A few minutes pause having been allowed, that the combatants and their horses might recover breath, Prince John with histruncheon signed to the trumpets to sound the onset. The champions a second time sprung from their stations, and closed in the centreof the lists, with the same speed, the same dexterity, the same violence, but not the same equal fortune as before.In this second encounter, the Templar aimed at the centre of his antagonist’s shield, and struck it so fair and forcibly, that his spearwent to shivers, and the Disinherited Knight reeled in his saddle. On the other hand, that champion had, in the beginning of his career,directed the point of his lance towards Bois-Guilbert’s shield, but, changing his aim almost in the moment of encounter, he addressedit to the helmet, a mark more difﬁcult to hit, but which, if attained, rendered the shock more irresistible. Fair and true he hit theNorman on the visor, where his lance’s point kept hold of the bars. Yet, even at this disadvantage, the Templar sustained his highreputation; and had not the girths of his saddle burst, he might not have been unhorsed. As it chanced, however, saddle, horse, andman, rolled on the ground under a cloud of dust.
To extricate himself from the stirrups and fallen steed, was to the Templar scarce the work of a moment; and, stung with madness,both at his disgrace and at the acclamations with which it was hailed by the spectators, he drew his sword and waved it in deﬁance ofhis conqueror. The Disinherited Knight sprung from his steed, and also unsheathed his sword. The marshals of the ﬁeld, however,spurred their horses between them, and reminded them, that the laws of the tournament did not, on the present occasion, permit thisspecies of encounter.“We shall meet again, I trust,” said the Templar, casting a resentful glance at his antagonist; “and where there are none to separateus.”“If we do not,” said the Disinherited Knight, “the fault shall not be mine. On foot or horseback, with spear, with axe, or with sword,I am alike ready to encounter thee.”More and angrier words would have been exchanged, but the marshals, crossing their lances betwixt them, compelled them toseparate. The Disinherited Knight returned to his ﬁrst station, and Bois-Guilbert to his tent, where he remained for the rest of the dayin an agony of despair.Without alighting from his horse, the conqueror called for a bowl of wine, and opening the beaver, or lower part of his helmet,announced that he quaffed it, “To all true English hearts, and to the confusion of foreign tyrants.” He then commanded his trumpet tosound a deﬁance to the challengers, and desired a herald to announce to them, that he should make no election, but was willing toencounter them in the order in which they pleased to advance against him.The gigantic Front-de-Bœuf, armed in sable armour, was the ﬁrst who took the ﬁeld. He bore on a white shield a black bull’s head,half defaced by the numerous encounters which he had undergone, and bearing the arrogant motto, “Cave, Adsum”. Over thischampion the Disinherited Knight obtained a slight but decisive advantage. Both Knights broke their lances fairly, but Front-de-Bœuf,who lost a stirrup in the encounter, was adjudged to have the disadvantage.In the stranger’s third encounter with Sir Philip Malvoisin, he was equally successful; striking that baron so forcibly on the casque,that the laces of the helmet broke, and Malvoisin, only saved from falling by being unhelmeted, was declared vanquished like hiscompanions.In his fourth combat with De Grantmesnil, the Disinherited Knight showed as much courtesy as he had hitherto evinced courageand dexterity. De Grantmesnil’s horse, which was young and violent, reared and plunged in the course of the career so as to disturb therider’s aim, and the stranger, declining to take the advantage which this accident afforded him, raised his lance, and passing hisantagonist without touching him, wheeled his horse and rode back again to his own end of the lists, offering his antagonist, by aherald, the chance of a second encounter. This De Grantmesnil declined, avowing himself vanquished as much by the courtesy as bythe address of his opponent.Ralph de Vipont summed up the list of the stranger’s triumphs, being hurled to the ground with such force, that the blood gushedfrom his nose and his mouth, and he was borne senseless from the lists.The acclamations of thousands applauded the unanimous award of the Prince and marshals, announcing that day’s honours to theDisinherited Knight.CHAPTER IX——In the midst was seenA lady of a more majestic mien,By stature and by beauty mark’d their sovereign Queen.And as in beauty she surpass’d the choir,So nobler than the rest was her attire;A crown of ruddy gold enclosed her brow,Plain without pomp, and rich without a show;A branch of Agnus Castus in her hand,She bore aloft her symbol of command.THE FLOWER AND THE LEAFWilliam de Wyvil and Stephen de Martival, the marshals of the ﬁeld, were the ﬁrst to offer their congratulations to the victor,praying him, at the same time, to suffer his helmet to be unlaced, or, at least, that he would raise his visor ere they conducted him toreceive the prize of the day’s tourney from the hands of Prince John. The Disinherited Knight, with all knightly courtesy, declinedtheir request, alleging, that he could not at this time suffer his face to be seen, for reasons which he had assigned to the heralds whenhe entered the lists. The marshals were perfectly satisﬁed by this reply; for amidst the frequent and capricious vows by which knightswere accustomed to bind themselves in the days of chivalry, there were none more common than those by which they engaged toremain incognito for a certain space, or until some particular adventure was achieved. The marshals, therefore, pressed no farther intothe mystery of the Disinherited Knight, but, announcing to Prince John the conqueror’s desire to remain unknown, they requestedpermission to bring him before his Grace, in order that he might receive the reward of his valour.John’s curiosity was excited by the mystery observed by the stranger; and, being already displeased with the issue of thetournament, in which the challengers whom he favoured had been successively defeated by one knight, he answered haughtily to themarshals, “By the light of Our Lady’s brow, this same knight hath been disinherited as well of his courtesy as of his lands, since hedesires to appear before us without uncovering his face.—Wot ye, my lords,” he said, turning round to his train, “who this gallant canbe, that bears himself thus proudly?”“I cannot guess,” answered De Bracy, “nor did I think there had been within the four seas that girth Britain a champion that couldbear down these ﬁve knights in one day’s jousting. By my faith, I shall never forget the force with which he shocked De Vipont. Thepoor Hospitaller was hurled from his saddle like a stone from a sling.”“Boast not of that,” said a Knight of St John, who was present; “your Temple champion had no better luck. I saw your brave lance,Bois-Guilbert, roll thrice over, grasping his hands full of sand at every turn.”De Bracy, being attached to the Templars, would have replied, but was prevented by Prince John. “Silence, sirs!” he said; “whatunproﬁtable debate have we here?”“The victor,” said De Wyvil, “still waits the pleasure of your highness.”“It is our pleasure,” answered John, “that he do so wait until we learn whether there is not some one who can at least guess at hisname and quality. Should he remain there till night-fall, he has had work enough to keep him warm.”“Your Grace,” said Waldemar Fitzurse, “will do less than due honour to the victor, if you compel him to wait till we tell yourhighness that which we cannot know; at least I can form no guess—unless he be one of the good lances who accompanied KingRichard to Palestine, and who are now straggling homeward from the Holy Land.”“It may be the Earl of Salisbury,” said De Bracy; “he is about the same pitch.”“Sir Thomas de Multon, the Knight of Gilsland, rather,” said Fitzurse; “Salisbury is bigger in the bones.” A whisper arose amongthe train, but by whom ﬁrst suggested could not be ascertained. “It might be the King—it might be Richard Cœur-de-Lion himself!”“Over God’s forbode!” said Prince John, involuntarily turning at the same time as pale as death, and shrinking as if blighted by aﬂash of lightning; “Waldemar!—De Bracy! brave knights and gentlemen, remember your promises, and stand truly by me!”“Here is no danger impending,” said Waldemar Fitzurse; “are you so little acquainted with the gigantic limbs of your father’s son,as to think they can be held within the circumference of yonder suit of armour?—De Wyvil and Martival, you will best serve thePrince by bringing forward the victor to the throne, and ending an error that has conjured all the blood from his cheeks.—Look at himmore closely,” he continued, “your highness will see that he wants three inches of King Richard’s height, and twice as much of hisshoulder-breadth. The very horse he backs, could not have carried the ponderous weight of King Richard through a single course.”While he was yet speaking, the marshals brought forward the Disinherited Knight to the foot of a wooden ﬂight of steps, whichformed the ascent from the lists to Prince John’s throne. Still discomposed with the idea that his brother, so much injured, and towhom he was so much indebted, had suddenly arrived in his native kingdom, even the distinctions pointed out by Fitzurse did notaltogether remove the Prince’s apprehensions; and while, with a short and embarrassed eulogy upon his valour, he caused to bedelivered to him the war-horse assigned as the prize, he trembled lest from the barred visor of the mailed form before him, an answermight be returned, in the deep and awful accents of Richard the Lion-hearted.But the Disinherited Knight spoke not a word in reply to the compliment of the Prince, which he only acknowledged with aprofound obeisance.The horse was led into the lists by two grooms richly dressed, the animal itself being fully accoutred with the richest war-furniture;which, however, scarcely added to the value of the noble creature in the eyes of those who were judges. Laying one hand upon thepommel of the saddle, the Disinherited Knight vaulted at once upon the back of the steed without making use of the stirrup, and,brandishing aloft his lance, rode twice around the lists, exhibiting the points and paces of the horse with the skill of a perfecthorseman.The appearance of vanity, which might otherwise have been attributed to this display, was removed by the propriety shown inexhibiting to the best advantage the princely reward with which he had been just honoured, and the Knight was again greeted by theacclamations of all present.In the meanwhile, the bustling Prior of Jorvaulx had reminded Prince John, in a whisper, that the victor must now display his goodjudgment, instead of his valour, by selecting from among the beauties who graced the galleries a lady, who should ﬁll the throne of theQueen of Beauty and of Love, and deliver the prize of the tourney upon the ensuing day. The Prince accordingly made a sign with histruncheon, as the Knight passed him in his second career around the lists. The Knight turned towards the throne, and, sinking hislance, until the point was within a foot of the ground, remained motionless, as if expecting John’s commands; while all admired thesudden dexterity with which he instantly reduced his ﬁery steed from a state of violent emotion and high excitation to the stillness ofan equestrian statue.“Sir Disinherited Knight,” said Prince John, “since that is the only title by which we can address you, it is now your duty, as well asprivilege, to name the fair lady, who, as Queen of Honour and of Love, is to preside over next day’s festival. If, as a stranger in ourland, you should require the aid of other judgment to guide your own, we can only say that Alicia, the daughter of our gallant knightWaldemar Fitzurse, has at our court been long held the ﬁrst in beauty as in place. Nevertheless, it is your undoubted prerogative toconfer on whom you please this crown, by the delivery of which to the lady of your choice, the election of to-morrow’s Queen will beformal and complete.—Raise your lance.”The Knight obeyed; and Prince John placed upon its point a coronet of green satin, having around its edge a circlet of gold, theupper edge of which was relieved by arrow-points and hearts placed interchangeably, like the strawberry leaves and balls upon a ducalcrown.In the broad hint which he dropped respecting the daughter of Waldemar Fitzurse, John had more than one motive, each theoffspring of a mind, which was a strange mixture of carelessness and presumption with low artiﬁce and cunning. He wished to banishfrom the minds of the chivalry around him his own indecent and unacceptable jest respecting the Jewess Rebecca; he was desirous ofconciliating Alicia’s father Waldemar, of whom he stood in awe, and who had more than once shown himself dissatisﬁed during thecourse of the day’s proceedings. He had also a wish to establish himself in the good graces of the lady; for John was at least aslicentious in his pleasures as proﬂigate in his ambition. But besides all these reasons, he was desirous to raise up against theDisinherited Knight (towards whom he already entertained a strong dislike) a powerful enemy in the person of Waldemar Fitzurse,who was likely, he thought, highly to resent the injury done to his daughter, in case, as was not unlikely, the victor should makeanother choice.And so indeed it proved. For the Disinherited Knight passed the gallery close to that of the Prince, in which the Lady Alicia wasseated in the full pride of triumphant beauty, and, pacing forwards as slowly as he had hitherto rode swiftly around the lists, he seemedto exercise his right of examining the numerous fair faces which adorned that splendid circle.It was worth while to see the different conduct of the beauties who underwent this examination, during the time it was proceeding.Some blushed, some assumed an air of pride and dignity, some looked straight forward, and essayed to seem utterly unconscious ofwhat was going on, some drew back in alarm, which was perhaps affected, some endeavoured to forbear smiling, and there were twoor three who laughed outright. There were also some who dropped their veils over their charms; but, as the Wardour Manuscript saysthese were fair ones of ten years standing, it may be supposed that, having had their full share of such vanities, they were willing towithdraw their claim, in order to give a fair chance to the rising beauties of the age.At length the champion paused beneath the balcony in which the Lady Rowena was placed, and the expectation of the spectatorswas excited to the utmost.It must be owned, that if an interest displayed in his success could have bribed the Disinherited Knight, the part of the lists beforewhich he paused had merited his predilection. Cedric the Saxon, overjoyed at the discomﬁture of the Templar, and still more so at themiscarriage of his two malevolent neighbours, Front-de-Bœuf and Malvoisin, had, with his body half stretched over the balcony,accompanied the victor in each course, not with his eyes only, but with his whole heart and soul. The Lady Rowena had watched theprogress of the day with equal attention, though without openly betraying the same intense interest. Even the unmoved Athelstane hadshown symptoms of shaking off his apathy, when, calling for a huge goblet of muscadine, he quaffed it to the health of theDisinherited Knight. Another group, stationed under the gallery occupied by the Saxons, had shown no less interest in the fate of theday.“Father Abraham!” said Isaac of York, when the ﬁrst course was run betwixt the Templar and the Disinherited Knight, “how ﬁercelythat Gentile rides! Ah, the good horse that was brought all the long way from Barbary, he takes no more care of him than if he were awild ass’s colt—and the noble armour, that was worth so many zecchins to Joseph Pareira, the armourer of Milan, besides seventy inthe hundred of proﬁts, he cares for it as little as if he had found it in the highways!”“If he risks his own person and limbs, father,” said Rebecca, “in doing such a dreadful battle, he can scarce be expected to spare hishorse and armour.”“Child!” replied Isaac, somewhat heated, “thou knowest not what thou speakest—His neck and limbs are his own, but his horse andarmour belong to—Holy Jacob! what was I about to say!—Nevertheless, it is a good youth—See, Rebecca! see, he is again about togo up to battle against the Philistine—Pray, child—pray for the safety of the good youth,—and of the speedy horse, and the richarmour.—God of my fathers!” he again exclaimed, “he hath conquered, and the uncircumcised Philistine hath fallen before his lance,—even as Og the King of Bashan, and Sihon, King of the Amorites, fell before the sword of our fathers!—Surely he shall take theirgold and their silver, and their war-horses, and their armour of brass and of steel, for a prey and for a spoil.”The same anxiety did the worthy Jew display during every course that was run, seldom failing to hazard a hasty calculationconcerning the value of the horse and armour which was forfeited to the champion upon each new success. There had been thereforeno small interest taken in the success of the Disinherited Knight, by those who occupied the part of the lists before which he nowpaused.Whether from indecision, or some other motive of hesitation, the champion of the day remained stationary for more than a minute,while the eyes of the silent audience were riveted upon his motions; and then, gradually and gracefully sinking the point of his lance,he deposited the coronet which it supported at the feet of the fair Rowena. The trumpets instantly sounded, while the heraldsproclaimed the Lady Rowena the Queen of Beauty and of Love for the ensuing day, menacing with suitable penalties those whoshould be disobedient to her authority. They then repeated their cry of Largesse, to which Cedric, in the height of his joy, replied by anample donative, and to which Athelstane, though less promptly, added one equally large.There was some murmuring among the damsels of Norman descent, who were as much unused to see the preference given to aSaxon beauty, as the Norman nobles were to sustain defeat in the games of chivalry which they themselves had introduced. But thesesounds of disaffection were drowned by the popular shout of “Long live the Lady Rowena, the chosen and lawful Queen of Love andof Beauty!” To which many in the lower area added, “Long live the Saxon Princess! long live the race of the immortal Alfred!”However unacceptable these sounds might be to Prince John, and to those around him, he saw himself nevertheless obliged toconﬁrm the nomination of the victor, and accordingly calling to horse, he left his throne; and mounting his jennet, accompanied by histrain, he again entered the lists. The Prince paused a moment beneath the gallery of the Lady Alicia, to whom he paid hiscompliments, observing, at the same time, to those around him—“By my halidome, sirs! if the Knight’s feats in arms have shown thathe hath limbs and sinews, his choice hath no less proved that his eyes are none of the clearest.”It was on this occasion, as during his whole life, John’s misfortune, not perfectly to understand the characters of those whom hewished to conciliate. Waldemar Fitzurse was rather offended than pleased at the Prince stating thus broadly an opinion, that hisdaughter had been slighted.“I know no right of chivalry,” he said, “more precious or inalienable than that of each free knight to choose his lady-love by his ownjudgment. My daughter courts distinction from no one; and in her own character, and in her own sphere, will never fail to receive thefull proportion of that which is her due.”Prince John replied not; but, spurring his horse, as if to give vent to his vexation, he made the animal bound forward to the gallerywhere Rowena was seated, with the crown still at her feet.“Assume,” he said, “fair lady, the mark of your sovereignty, to which none vows homage more sincerely than ourself, John ofAnjou; and if it please you to-day, with your noble sire and friends, to grace our banquet in the Castle of Ashby, we shall learn to knowthe empress to whose service we devote to-morrow.”Rowena remained silent, and Cedric answered for her in his native Saxon.“The Lady Rowena,” he said, “possesses not the language in which to reply to your courtesy, or to sustain her part in your festival. Ialso, and the noble Athelstane of Coningsburgh, speak only the language, and practise only the manners, of our fathers. We thereforedecline with thanks your Highness’s courteous invitation to the banquet. To-morrow, the Lady Rowena will take upon her the state towhich she has been called by the free election of the victor Knight, conﬁrmed by the acclamations of the people.”So saying, he lifted the coronet, and placed it upon Rowena’s head, in token of her acceptance of the temporary authority assignedto her.“What says he?” said Prince John, affecting not to understand the Saxon language, in which, however, he was well skilled. Thepurport of Cedric’s speech was repeated to him in French. “It is well,” he said; “to-morrow we will ourself conduct this mutesovereign to her seat of dignity.—You, at least, Sir Knight,” he added, turning to the victor, who had remained near the gallery, “willthis day share our banquet?”The Knight, speaking for the ﬁrst time, in a low and hurried voice, excused himself by pleading fatigue, and the necessity ofpreparing for to-morrow’s encounter.“It is well,” said Prince John, haughtily; “although unused to such refusals, we will endeavour to digest our banquet as we may,though ungraced by the most successful in arms, and his elected Queen of Beauty.”So saying, he prepared to leave the lists with his glittering train, and his turning his steed for that purpose, was the signal for thebreaking up and dispersion of the spectators.Yet, with the vindictive memory proper to offended pride, especially when combined with conscious want of desert, John hadhardly proceeded three paces, ere again, turning around, he ﬁxed an eye of stern resentment upon the yeoman who had displeased himin the early part of the day, and issued his commands to the men-at-arms who stood near—“On your life, suffer not that fellow toescape.”The yeoman stood the angry glance of the Prince with the same unvaried steadiness which had marked his former deportment,saying, with a smile, “I have no intention to leave Ashby until the day after to-morrow—I must see how Staffordshire andLeicestershire can draw their bows—the forests of Needwood and Charnwood must rear good archers.”“I,” said Prince John to his attendants, but not in direct reply,—“I will see how he can draw his own; and woe betide him unless hisskill should prove some apology for his insolence!”“It is full time,” said De Bracy, “that the ‘outrecuidance’ 19 of these peasants should be restrained by some striking example.”Waldemar Fitzurse, who probably thought his patron was not taking the readiest road to popularity, shrugged up his shoulders andwas silent. Prince John resumed his retreat from the lists, and the dispersion of the multitude became general.In various routes, according to the different quarters from which they came, and in groups of various numbers, the spectators wereseen retiring over the plain. By far the most numerous part streamed towards the town of Ashby, where many of the distinguishedpersons were lodged in the castle, and where others found accommodation in the town itself. Among these were most of the knightswho had already appeared in the tournament, or who proposed to ﬁght there the ensuing day, and who, as they rode slowly along,talking over the events of the day, were greeted with loud shouts by the populace. The same acclamations were bestowed upon PrinceJohn, although he was indebted for them rather to the splendour of his appearance and train, than to the popularity of his character.A more sincere and more general, as well as a better-merited acclamation, attended the victor of the day, until, anxious to withdrawhimself from popular notice, he accepted the accommodation of one of those pavilions pitched at the extremities of the lists, the use ofwhich was courteously tendered him by the marshals of the ﬁeld. On his retiring to his tent, many who had lingered in the lists, to lookupon and form conjectures concerning him, also dispersed.The signs and sounds of a tumultuous concourse of men lately crowded together in one place, and agitated by the same passingevents, were now exchanged for the distant hum of voices of different groups retreating in all directions, and these speedily died awayin silence. No other sounds were heard save the voices of the menials who stripped the galleries of their cushions and tapestry, in orderto put them in safety for the night, and wrangled among themselves for the half-used bottles of wine and relics of the refreshmentwhich had been served round to the spectators.Beyond the precincts of the lists more than one forge was erected; and these now began to glimmer through the twilight,announcing the toil of the armourers, which was to continue through the whole night, in order to repair or alter the suits of armour tobe used again on the morrow.A strong guard of men-at-arms, renewed at intervals, from two hours to two hours, surrounded the lists, and kept watch during thenight.CHAPTER XThus, like the sad presaging raven, that tollsThe sick man’s passport in her hollow beak,And in the shadow of the silent nightDoth shake contagion from her sable wings;Vex’d and tormented, runs poor Barrabas,With fatal curses towards these Christians.JEW OF MALTAThe Disinherited Knight had no sooner reached his pavilion, than squires and pages in abundance tendered their services to disarmhim, to bring fresh attire, and to offer him the refreshment of the bath. Their zeal on this occasion was perhaps sharpened by curiosity,since every one desired to know who the knight was that had gained so many laurels, yet had refused, even at the command of PrinceJohn, to lift his visor or to name his name. But their ofﬁcious inquisitiveness was not gratiﬁed. The Disinherited Knight refused allother assistance save that of his own squire, or rather yeoman—a clownish-looking man, who, wrapt in a cloak of dark-coloured felt,and having his head and face half-buried in a Norman bonnet made of black fur, seemed to affect the incognito as much as his master.All others being excluded from the tent, this attendant relieved his master from the more burdensome parts of his armour, and placedfood and wine before him, which the exertions of the day rendered very acceptable.The Knight had scarcely ﬁnished a hasty meal, ere his menial announced to him that ﬁve men, each leading a barbed steed, desiredto speak with him. The Disinherited Knight had exchanged his armour for the long robe usually worn by those of his condition, which,being furnished with a hood, concealed the features, when such was the pleasure of the wearer, almost as completely as the visor of thehelmet itself, but the twilight, which was now fast darkening, would of itself have rendered a disguise unnecessary, unless to personsto whom the face of an individual chanced to be particularly well known.The Disinherited Knight, therefore, stept boldly forth to the front of his tent, and found in attendance the squires of the challengers,whom he easily knew by their russet and black dresses, each of whom led his master’s charger, loaded with the armour in which hehad that day fought.“According to the laws of chivalry,” said the foremost of these men, “I, Baldwin de Oyley, squire to the redoubted Knight Brian deBois-Guilbert, make offer to you, styling yourself, for the present, the Disinherited Knight, of the horse and armour used by the saidBrian de Bois-Guilbert in this day’s Passage of Arms, leaving it with your nobleness to retain or to ransom the same, according to yourpleasure; for such is the law of arms.”The other squires repeated nearly the same formula, and then stood to await the decision of the Disinherited Knight.“To you four, sirs,” replied the Knight, addressing those who had last spoken, “and to your honourable and valiant masters, I haveone common reply. Commend me to the noble knights, your masters, and say, I should do ill to deprive them of steeds and arms whichcan never be used by braver cavaliers.—I would I could here end my message to these gallant knights; but being, as I term myself, intruth and earnest, the Disinherited, I must be thus far bound to your masters, that they will, of their courtesy, be pleased to ransomtheir steeds and armour, since that which I wear I can hardly term mine own.”“We stand commissioned, each of us,” answered the squire of Reginald Front-de-Bœuf, “to offer a hundred zecchins in ransom ofthese horses and suits of armour.”“It is sufﬁcient,” said the Disinherited Knight. “Half the sum my present necessities compel me to accept; of the remaining half,distribute one moiety among yourselves, sir squires, and divide the other half betwixt the heralds and the pursuivants, and minstrels,and attendants.”The squires, with cap in hand, and low reverences, expressed their deep sense of a courtesy and generosity not often practised, atleast upon a scale so extensive. The Disinherited Knight then addressed his discourse to Baldwin, the squire of Brian de Bois-Guilbert.“From your master,” said he, “I will accept neither arms nor ransom. Say to him in my name, that our strife is not ended—no, not tillwe have fought as well with swords as with lances—as well on foot as on horseback. To this mortal quarrel he has himself deﬁed me,and I shall not forget the challenge.—Meantime, let him be assured, that I hold him not as one of his companions, with whom I canwith pleasure exchange courtesies; but rather as one with whom I stand upon terms of mortal deﬁance.”“My master,” answered Baldwin, “knows how to requite scorn with scorn, and blows with blows, as well as courtesy with courtesy.Since you disdain to accept from him any share of the ransom at which you have rated the arms of the other knights, I must leave hisarmour and his horse here, being well assured that he will never deign to mount the one nor wear the other.”“You have spoken well, good squire,” said the Disinherited Knight, “well and boldly, as it beseemeth him to speak who answers foran absent master. Leave not, however, the horse and armour here. Restore them to thy master; or, if he scorns to accept them, retainthem, good friend, for thine own use. So far as they are mine, I bestow them upon you freely.”Baldwin made a deep obeisance, and retired with his companions; and the Disinherited Knight entered the pavilion.“Thus far, Gurth,” said he, addressing his attendant, “the reputation of English chivalry hath not suffered in my hands.”“And I,” said Gurth, “for a Saxon swineherd, have not ill played the personage of a Norman squire-at-arms.”“Yea, but,” answered the Disinherited Knight, “thou hast ever kept me in anxiety lest thy clownish bearing should discover thee.”“Tush!” said Gurth, “I fear discovery from none, saving my playfellow, Wamba the Jester, of whom I could never discover whetherhe were most knave or fool. Yet I could scarce choose but laugh, when my old master passed so near to me, dreaming all the while thatGurth was keeping his porkers many a mile off, in the thickets and swamps of Rotherwood. If I am discovered—-”“Enough,” said the Disinherited Knight, “thou knowest my promise.”“Nay, for that matter,” said Gurth, “I will never fail my friend for fear of my skin-cutting. I have a tough hide, that will bear knife orscourge as well as any boar’s hide in my herd.”“Trust me, I will requite the risk you run for my love, Gurth,” said the Knight. “Meanwhile, I pray you to accept these ten pieces ofgold.”“I am richer,” said Gurth, putting them into his pouch, “than ever was swineherd or bondsman.”“Take this bag of gold to Ashby,” continued his master, “and ﬁnd out Isaac the Jew of York, and let him pay himself for the horseand arms with which his credit supplied me.”“Nay, by St Dunstan,” replied Gurth, “that I will not do.”“How, knave,” replied his master, “wilt thou not obey my commands?”“So they be honest, reasonable, and Christian commands,” replied Gurth; “but this is none of these. To suffer the Jew to pay himselfwould be dishonest, for it would be cheating my master; and unreasonable, for it were the part of a fool; and unchristian, since itwould be plundering a believer to enrich an inﬁdel.”“See him contented, however, thou stubborn varlet,” said the Disinherited Knight.“I will do so,” said Gurth, taking the bag under his cloak, and leaving the apartment; “and it will go hard,” he muttered, “but Icontent him with one-half of his own asking.” So saying, he departed, and left the Disinherited Knight to his own perplexedruminations; which, upon more accounts than it is now possible to communicate to the reader, were of a nature peculiarly agitatingand painful.We must now change the scene to the village of Ashby, or rather to a country house in its vicinity belonging to a wealthy Israelite,with whom Isaac, his daughter, and retinue, had taken up their quarters; the Jews, it is well known, being as liberal in exercising theduties of hospitality and charity among their own people, as they were alleged to be reluctant and churlish in extending them to thosewhom they termed Gentiles, and whose treatment of them certainly merited little hospitality at their hand.In an apartment, small indeed, but richly furnished with decorations of an Oriental taste, Rebecca was seated on a heap ofembroidered cushions, which, piled along a low platform that surrounded the chamber, served, like the estrada of the Spaniards,instead of chairs and stools. She was watching the motions of her father with a look of anxious and ﬁlial affection, while he paced theapartment with a dejected mien and disordered step; sometimes clasping his hands together—sometimes casting his eyes to the roof ofthe apartment, as one who laboured under great mental tribulation. “O, Jacob!” he exclaimed—“O, all ye twelve Holy Fathers of ourtribe! what a losing venture is this for one who hath duly kept every jot and tittle of the law of Moses—Fifty zecchins wrenched fromme at one clutch, and by the talons of a tyrant!”“But, father,” said Rebecca, “you seemed to give the gold to Prince John willingly.”“Willingly? the blotch of Egypt upon him!—Willingly, saidst thou?—Ay, as willingly as when, in the Gulf of Lyons, I ﬂung overmy merchandise to lighten the ship, while she laboured in the tempest—robed the seething billows in my choice silks—perfumed theirbriny foam with myrrh and aloes—enriched their caverns with gold and silver work! And was not that an hour of unutterable misery,though my own hands made the sacriﬁce?”“But it was a sacriﬁce which Heaven exacted to save our lives,” answered Rebecca, “and the God of our fathers has since blessedyour store and your gettings.”“Ay,” answered Isaac, “but if the tyrant lays hold on them as he did to-day, and compels me to smile while he is robbing me?—O,daughter, disinherited and wandering as we are, the worst evil which befalls our race is, that when we are wronged and plundered, allthe world laughs around, and we are compelled to suppress our sense of injury, and to smile tamely, when we would revenge bravely.”“Think not thus of it, my father,” said Rebecca; “we also have advantages. These Gentiles, cruel and oppressive as they are, are insome sort dependent on the dispersed children of Zion, whom they despise and persecute. Without the aid of our wealth, they couldneither furnish forth their hosts in war, nor their triumphs in peace, and the gold which we lend them returns with increase to ourcoffers. We are like the herb which ﬂourisheth most when it is most trampled on. Even this day’s pageant had not proceeded withoutthe consent of the despised Jew, who furnished the means.”“Daughter,” said Isaac, “thou hast harped upon another string of sorrow. The goodly steed and the rich armour, equal to the fullproﬁt of my adventure with our Kirjath Jairam of Leicester—there is a dead loss too—ay, a loss which swallows up the gains of aweek; ay, of the space between two Sabbaths—and yet it may end better than I now think, for ’tis a good youth.”“Assuredly,” said Rebecca, “you shall not repent you of requiting the good deed received of the stranger knight.”“I trust so, daughter,” said Isaac, “and I trust too in the rebuilding of Zion; but as well do I hope with my own bodily eyes to see thewalls and battlements of the new Temple, as to see a Christian, yea, the very best of Christians, repay a debt to a Jew, unless under theawe of the judge and jailor.”So saying, he resumed his discontented walk through the apartment; and Rebecca, perceiving that her attempts at consolation onlyserved to awaken new subjects of complaint, wisely desisted from her unavailing efforts—a prudential line of conduct, and werecommend to all who set up for comforters and advisers, to follow it in the like circumstances.The evening was now becoming dark, when a Jewish servant entered the apartment, and placed upon the table two silver lamps, fedwith perfumed oil; the richest wines, and the most delicate refreshments, were at the same time displayed by another Israelitishdomestic on a small ebony table, inlaid with silver; for, in the interior of their houses, the Jews refused themselves no expensiveindulgences. At the same time the servant informed Isaac, that a Nazarene (so they termed Christians, while conversing amongthemselves) desired to speak with him. He that would live by trafﬁc, must hold himself at the disposal of every one claiming businesswith him. Isaac at once replaced on the table the untasted glass of Greek wine which he had just raised to his lips, and saying hastily tohis daughter, “Rebecca, veil thyself,” commanded the stranger to be admitted.Just as Rebecca had dropped over her ﬁne features a screen of silver gauze which reached to her feet, the door opened, and Gurthentered, wrapt in the ample folds of his Norman mantle. His appearance was rather suspicious than prepossessing, especially as,instead of dofﬁng his bonnet, he pulled it still deeper over his rugged brow.“Art thou Isaac the Jew of York?” said Gurth, in Saxon.“I am,” replied Isaac, in the same language, (for his trafﬁc had rendered every tongue spoken in Britain familiar to him)—“and whoart thou?”“That is not to the purpose,” answered Gurth.“As much as my name is to thee,” replied Isaac; “for without knowing thine, how can I hold intercourse with thee?”“Easily,” answered Gurth; “I, being to pay money, must know that I deliver it to the right person; thou, who are to receive it, willnot, I think, care very greatly by whose hands it is delivered.”“O,” said the Jew, “you are come to pay moneys?—Holy Father Abraham! that altereth our relation to each other. And from whomdost thou bring it?”“From the Disinherited Knight,” said Gurth, “victor in this day’s tournament. It is the price of the armour supplied to him by KirjathJairam of Leicester, on thy recommendation. The steed is restored to thy stable. I desire to know the amount of the sum which I am topay for the armour.”“I said he was a good youth!” exclaimed Isaac with joyful exultation. “A cup of wine will do thee no harm,” he added, ﬁlling andhanding to the swineherd a richer drought than Gurth had ever before tasted. “And how much money,” continued Isaac, “has thoubrought with thee?”“Holy Virgin!” said Gurth, setting down the cup, “what nectar these unbelieving dogs drink, while true Christians are fain to quaffale as muddy and thick as the draff we give to hogs!—What money have I brought with me?” continued the Saxon, when he hadﬁnished this uncivil ejaculation, “even but a small sum; something in hand the whilst. What, Isaac! thou must bear a conscience,though it be a Jewish one.”“Nay, but,” said Isaac, “thy master has won goodly steeds and rich armours with the strength of his lance, and of his right hand—but ’tis a good youth—the Jew will take these in present payment, and render him back the surplus.”“My master has disposed of them already,” said Gurth.“Ah! that was wrong,” said the Jew, “that was the part of a fool. No Christians here could buy so many horses and armour—no Jewexcept myself would give him half the values. But thou hast a hundred zecchins with thee in that bag,” said Isaac, prying underGurth’s cloak, “it is a heavy one.”“I have heads for cross-bow bolts in it,” said Gurth, readily.“Well, then”—said Isaac, panting and hesitating between habitual love of gain and a new-born desire to be liberal in the presentinstance, “if I should say that I would take eighty zecchins for the good steed and the rich armour, which leaves me not a guilder’sproﬁt, have you money to pay me?”“Barely,” said Gurth, though the sum demanded was more reasonable than he expected, “and it will leave my master nigh penniless.Nevertheless, if such be your least offer, I must be content.”“Fill thyself another goblet of wine,” said the Jew. “Ah! eighty zecchins is too little. It leaveth no proﬁt for the usages of themoneys; and, besides, the good horse may have suffered wrong in this day’s encounter. O, it was a hard and a dangerous meeting! manand steed rushing on each other like wild bulls of Bashan! The horse cannot but have had wrong.”“And I say,” replied Gurth, “he is sound, wind and limb; and you may see him now, in your stable. And I say, over and above, thatseventy zecchins is enough for the armour, and I hope a Christian’s word is as good as a Jew’s. If you will not take seventy, I will carrythis bag” (and he shook it till the contents jingled) “back to my master.”“Nay, nay!” said Isaac; “lay down the talents—the shekels—the eighty zecchins, and thou shalt see I will consider thee liberally.”Gurth at length complied; and telling out eighty zecchins upon the table, the Jew delivered out to him an acquittance for the horseand suit of armour. The Jew’s hand trembled for joy as he wrapped up the ﬁrst seventy pieces of gold. The last ten he told over withmuch deliberation, pausing, and saying something as he took each piece from the table, and dropt it into his purse. It seemed as if hisavarice were struggling with his better nature, and compelling him to pouch zecchin after zecchin while his generosity urged him torestore some part at least to his benefactor, or as a donation to his agent. His whole speech ran nearly thus:“Seventy-one—seventy-two; thy master is a good youth—seventy-three, an excellent youth—seventy-four—that piece hath beenclipt within the ring—seventy-ﬁve—and that looketh light of weight—seventy-six—when thy master wants money, let him come toIsaac of York—seventy-seven—that is, with reasonable security.” Here he made a considerable pause, and Gurth had good hope thatthe last three pieces might escape the fate of their comrades; but the enumeration proceeded.—“Seventy-eight—thou art a good fellow—seventy-nine—and deservest something for thyself—-”Here the Jew paused again, and looked at the last zecchin, intending, doubtless, to bestow it upon Gurth. He weighed it upon the tipof his ﬁnger, and made it ring by dropping it upon the table. Had it rung too ﬂat, or had it felt a hair’s breadth too light, generosity hadcarried the day; but, unhappily for Gurth, the chime was full and true, the zecchin plump, newly coined, and a grain above weight.Isaac could not ﬁnd in his heart to part with it, so dropt it into his purse as if in absence of mind, with the words, “Eighty completesthe tale, and I trust thy master will reward thee handsomely.—Surely,” he added, looking earnestly at the bag, “thou hast more coins inthat pouch?”Gurth grinned, which was his nearest approach to a laugh, as he replied, “About the same quantity which thou hast just told over socarefully.” He then folded the quittance, and put it under his cap, adding,—“Peril of thy beard, Jew, see that this be full and ample!”He ﬁlled himself unbidden, a third goblet of wine, and left the apartment without ceremony.“Rebecca,” said the Jew, “that Ishmaelite hath gone somewhat beyond me. Nevertheless his master is a good youth—ay, and I amwell pleased that he hath gained shekels of gold and shekels of silver, even by the speed of his horse and by the strength of his lance,which, like that of Goliath the Philistine, might vie with a weaver’s beam.”As he turned to receive Rebecca’s answer, he observed, that during his chattering with Gurth, she had left the apartmentunperceived.In the meanwhile, Gurth had descended the stair, and, having reached the dark antechamber or hall, was puzzling about to discoverthe entrance, when a ﬁgure in white, shown by a small silver lamp which she held in her hand, beckoned him into a side apartment.Gurth had some reluctance to obey the summons. Rough and impetuous as a wild boar, where only earthly force was to beapprehended, he had all the characteristic terrors of a Saxon respecting fawns, forest-ﬁends, white women, and the whole of thesuperstitions which his ancestors had brought with them from the wilds of Germany. He remembered, moreover, that he was in thehouse of a Jew, a people who, besides the other unamiable qualities which popular report ascribed to them, were supposed to beprofound necromancers and cabalists. Nevertheless, after a moment’s pause, he obeyed the beckoning summons of the apparition, andfollowed her into the apartment which she indicated, where he found to his joyful surprise that his fair guide was the beautiful Jewesswhom he had seen at the tournament, and a short time in her father’s apartment.She asked him the particulars of his transaction with Isaac, which he detailed accurately.“My father did but jest with thee, good fellow,” said Rebecca; “he owes thy master deeper kindness than these arms and steed couldpay, were their value tenfold. What sum didst thou pay my father even now?”“Eighty zecchins,” said Gurth, surprised at the question.“In this purse,” said Rebecca, “thou wilt ﬁnd a hundred. Restore to thy master that which is his due, and enrich thyself with theremainder. Haste—begone—stay not to render thanks! and beware how you pass through this crowded town, where thou mayst easilylose both thy burden and thy life.—Reuben,” she added, clapping her hands together, “light forth this stranger, and fail not to drawlock and bar behind him.” Reuben, a dark-brow’d and black-bearded Israelite, obeyed her summons, with a torch in his hand; undidthe outward door of the house, and conducting Gurth across a paved court, let him out through a wicket in the entrance-gate, which heclosed behind him with such bolts and chains as would well have become that of a prison.“By St Dunstan,” said Gurth, as he stumbled up the dark avenue, “this is no Jewess, but an angel from heaven! Ten zecchins frommy brave young master—twenty from this pearl of Zion—Oh, happy day!—Such another, Gurth, will redeem thy bondage, and makethee a brother as free of thy guild as the best. And then do I lay down my swineherd’s horn and staff, and take the freeman’s sword andbuckler, and follow my young master to the death, without hiding either my face or my name.”CHAPTER XI1st Outlaw: Stand, sir, and throw us that you have about you;If not, we’ll make you sit, and riﬂe you.Speed: Sir, we are undone! these are the villainsThat all the travellers do fear so much.Val: My friends,—1st Out: That’s not so, sir, we are your enemies.2d Out: Peace! we’ll hear him.3d Out: Ay, by my beard, will we;For he’s a proper man.TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONAThe nocturnal adventures of Gurth were not yet concluded; indeed he himself became partly of that mind, when, after passing oneor two straggling houses which stood in the outskirts of the village, he found himself in a deep lane, running between two banksovergrown with hazel and holly, while here and there a dwarf oak ﬂung its arms altogether across the path. The lane was moreovermuch rutted and broken up by the carriages which had recently transported articles of various kinds to the tournament; and it was dark,for the banks and bushes intercepted the light of the harvest moon.From the village were heard the distant sounds of revelry, mixed occasionally with loud laughter, sometimes broken by screams,and sometimes by wild strains of distant music. All these sounds, intimating the disorderly state of the town, crowded with militarynobles and their dissolute attendants, gave Gurth some uneasiness. “The Jewess was right,” he said to himself. “By heaven and StDunstan, I would I were safe at my journey’s end with all this treasure! Here are such numbers, I will not say of arrant thieves, but oferrant knights and errant squires, errant monks and errant minstrels, errant jugglers and errant jesters, that a man with a single merkwould be in danger, much more a poor swineherd with a whole bagful of zecchins. Would I were out of the shade of these infernalbushes, that I might at least see any of St Nicholas’s clerks before they spring on my shoulders.”Gurth accordingly hastened his pace, in order to gain the open common to which the lane led, but was not so fortunate as toaccomplish his object. Just as he had attained the upper end of the lane, where the underwood was thickest, four men sprung uponhim, even as his fears anticipated, two from each side of the road, and seized him so fast, that resistance, if at ﬁrst practicable, wouldhave been now too late.—“Surrender your charge,” said one of them; “we are the deliverers of the commonwealth, who ease everyman of his burden.”“You should not ease me of mine so lightly,” muttered Gurth, whose surly honesty could not be tamed even by the pressure ofimmediate violence,—“had I it but in my power to give three strokes in its defence.”“We shall see that presently,” said the robber; and, speaking to his companions, he added, “bring along the knave. I see he wouldhave his head broken, as well as his purse cut, and so be let blood in two veins at once.”Gurth was hurried along agreeably to this mandate, and having been dragged somewhat roughly over the bank, on the left-hand sideof the lane, found himself in a straggling thicket, which lay betwixt it and the open common. He was compelled to follow his roughconductors into the very depth of this cover, where they stopt unexpectedly in an irregular open space, free in a great measure fromtrees, and on which, therefore, the beams of the moon fell without much interruption from boughs and leaves. Here his captors werejoined by two other persons, apparently belonging to the gang. They had short swords by their sides, and quarter-staves in their hands,and Gurth could now observe that all six wore visors, which rendered their occupation a matter of no question, even had their formerproceedings left it in doubt.“What money hast thou, churl?” said one of the thieves.“Thirty zecchins of my own property,” answered Gurth, doggedly.“A forfeit—a forfeit,” shouted the robbers; “a Saxon hath thirty zecchins, and returns sober from a village! An undeniable andunredeemable forfeit of all he hath about him.”“I hoarded it to purchase my freedom,” said Gurth.“Thou art an ass,” replied one of the thieves “three quarts of double ale had rendered thee as free as thy master, ay, and freer too, ifhe be a Saxon like thyself.”“A sad truth,” replied Gurth; “but if these same thirty zecchins will buy my freedom from you, unloose my hands, and I will paythem to you.”“Hold,” said one who seemed to exercise some authority over the others; “this bag which thou bearest, as I can feel through thycloak, contains more coin than thou hast told us of.”“It is the good knight my master’s,” answered Gurth, “of which, assuredly, I would not have spoken a word, had you been satisﬁedwith working your will upon mine own property.”“Thou art an honest fellow,” replied the robber, “I warrant thee; and we worship not St Nicholas so devoutly but what thy thirtyzecchins may yet escape, if thou deal uprightly with us. Meantime render up thy trust for a time.” So saying, he took from Gurth’sbreast the large leathern pouch, in which the purse given him by Rebecca was enclosed, as well as the rest of the zecchins, and thencontinued his interrogation.—“Who is thy master?”“The Disinherited Knight,” said Gurth.“Whose good lance,” replied the robber, “won the prize in to-day’s tourney? What is his name and lineage?”“It is his pleasure,” answered Gurth, “that they be concealed; and from me, assuredly, you will learn nought of them.”“What is thine own name and lineage?”“To tell that,” said Gurth, “might reveal my master’s.”“Thou art a saucy groom,” said the robber, “but of that anon. How comes thy master by this gold? is it of his inheritance, or by whatmeans hath it accrued to him?”“By his good lance,” answered Gurth.—“These bags contain the ransom of four good horses, and four good suits of armour.”“How much is there?” demanded the robber.“Two hundred zecchins.”“Only two hundred zecchins!” said the bandit; “your master hath dealt liberally by the vanquished, and put them to a cheap ransom.Name those who paid the gold.”Gurth did so.“The armour and horse of the Templar Brian de Bois-Guilbert, at what ransom were they held?—Thou seest thou canst not deceiveme.”“My master,” replied Gurth, “will take nought from the Templar save his life’s-blood. They are on terms of mortal deﬁance, andcannot hold courteous intercourse together.”“Indeed!”—repeated the robber, and paused after he had said the word. “And what wert thou now doing at Ashby with such acharge in thy custody?”“I went thither to render to Isaac the Jew of York,” replied Gurth, “the price of a suit of armour with which he ﬁtted my master forthis tournament.”“And how much didst thou pay to Isaac?—Methinks, to judge by weight, there is still two hundred zecchins in this pouch.”“I paid to Isaac,” said the Saxon, “eighty zecchins, and he restored me a hundred in lieu thereof.”“How! what!” exclaimed all the robbers at once; “darest thou triﬂe with us, that thou tellest such improbable lies?”“What I tell you,” said Gurth, “is as true as the moon is in heaven. You will ﬁnd the just sum in a silken purse within the leathernpouch, and separate from the rest of the gold.”“Bethink thee, man,” said the Captain, “thou speakest of a Jew—of an Israelite,—as unapt to restore gold, as the dry sand of hisdeserts to return the cup of water which the pilgrim spills upon them.”“There is no more mercy in them,” said another of the banditti, “than in an unbribed sheriffs ofﬁcer.”“It is, however, as I say,” said Gurth.“Strike a light instantly,” said the Captain; “I will examine this said purse; and if it be as this fellow says, the Jew’s bounty is littleless miraculous than the stream which relieved his fathers in the wilderness.”A light was procured accordingly, and the robber proceeded to examine the purse. The others crowded around him, and even twowho had hold of Gurth relaxed their grasp while they stretched their necks to see the issue of the search. Availing himself of theirnegligence, by a sudden exertion of strength and activity, Gurth shook himself free of their hold, and might have escaped, could hehave resolved to leave his master’s property behind him. But such was no part of his intention. He wrenched a quarter-staff from oneof the fellows, struck down the Captain, who was altogether unaware of his purpose, and had well-nigh repossessed himself of thepouch and treasure. The thieves, however, were too nimble for him, and again secured both the bag and the trusty Gurth.“Knave!” said the Captain, getting up, “thou hast broken my head; and with other men of our sort thou wouldst fare the worse forthy insolence. But thou shalt know thy fate instantly. First let us speak of thy master; the knight’s matters must go before the squire’s,according to the due order of chivalry. Stand thou fast in the meantime—if thou stir again, thou shalt have that will make thee quiet forthy life—Comrades!” he then said, addressing his gang, “this purse is embroidered with Hebrew characters, and I well believe theyeoman’s tale is true. The errant knight, his master, must needs pass us toll-free. He is too like ourselves for us to make booty of him,since dogs should not worry dogs where wolves and foxes are to be found in abundance.”“Like us?” answered one of the gang; “I should like to hear how that is made good.”“Why, thou fool,” answered the Captain, “is he not poor and disinherited as we are?—Doth he not win his substance at the sword’spoint as we do?—Hath he not beaten Front-de-Bœuf and Malvoisin, even as we would beat them if we could? Is he not the enemy tolife and death of Brian de Bois-Guilbert, whom we have so much reason to fear? And were all this otherwise, wouldst thou have usshow a worse conscience than an unbeliever, a Hebrew Jew?”show a worse conscience than an unbeliever, a Hebrew Jew?”“Nay, that were a shame,” muttered the other fellow; “and yet, when I served in the band of stout old Gandelyn, we had no suchscruples of conscience. And this insolent peasant,—he too, I warrant me, is to be dismissed scatheless?”“Not if THOU canst scathe him,” replied the Captain.—“Here, fellow,” continued he, addressing Gurth, “canst thou use the staff,that thou starts to it so readily?”“I think,” said Gurth, “thou shouldst be best able to reply to that question.”“Nay, by my troth, thou gavest me a round knock,” replied the Captain; “do as much for this fellow, and thou shalt pass scot-free;and if thou dost not—why, by my faith, as thou art such a sturdy knave, I think I must pay thy ransom myself.—Take thy staff,Miller,” he added, “and keep thy head; and do you others let the fellow go, and give him a staff—there is light enough to lay on loadby.”The two champions being alike armed with quarter-staves, stepped forward into the centre of the open space, in order to have thefull beneﬁt of the moonlight; the thieves in the meantime laughing, and crying to their comrade, “Miller! beware thy toll-dish.” TheMiller, on the other hand, holding his quarter-staff by the middle, and making it ﬂourish round his head after the fashion which theFrench call “faire le moulinet”, exclaimed boastfully, “Come on, churl, an thou darest: thou shalt feel the strength of a miller’sthumb!”
“If thou be’st a miller,” answered Gurth, undauntedly, making his weapon play around his head with equal dexterity, “thou artdoubly a thief, and I, as a true man, bid thee deﬁance.”So saying, the two champions closed together, and for a few minutes they displayed great equality in strength, courage, and skill,intercepting and returning the blows of their adversary with the most rapid dexterity, while, from the continued clatter of theirweapons, a person at a distance might have supposed that there were at least six persons engaged on each side. Less obstinate, andeven less dangerous combats, have been described in good heroic verse; but that of Gurth and the Miller must remain unsung, for wantof a sacred poet to do justice to its eventful progress. Yet, though quarter-staff play be out of date, what we can in prose we will do forthese bold champions.Long they fought equally, until the Miller began to lose temper at ﬁnding himself so stoutly opposed, and at hearing the laughter ofhis companions, who, as usual in such cases, enjoyed his vexation. This was not a state of mind favourable to the noble game ofquarter-staff, in which, as in ordinary cudgel-playing, the utmost coolness is requisite; and it gave Gurth, whose temper was steady,though surly, the opportunity of acquiring a decided advantage, in availing himself of which he displayed great mastery.The Miller pressed furiously forward, dealing blows with either end of his weapon alternately, and striving to come to half-staffdistance, while Gurth defended himself against the attack, keeping his hands about a yard asunder, and covering himself by shiftinghis weapon with great celerity, so as to protect his head and body. Thus did he maintain the defensive, making his eye, foot, and handkeep true time, until, observing his antagonist to lose wind, he darted the staff at his face with his left hand; and, as the Millerendeavoured to parry the thrust, he slid his right hand down to his left, and with the full swing of the weapon struck his opponent onthe left side of the head, who instantly measured his length upon the green sward.“Well and yeomanly done!” shouted the robbers; “fair play and Old England for ever! The Saxon hath saved both his purse and hishide, and the Miller has met his match.”“Thou mayst go thy ways, my friend,” said the Captain, addressing Gurth, in special conﬁrmation of the general voice, “and I willcause two of my comrades to guide thee by the best way to thy master’s pavilion, and to guard thee from night-walkers that mighthave less tender consciences than ours; for there is many one of them upon the amble in such a night as this. Take heed, however,” headded sternly; “remember thou hast refused to tell thy name—ask not after ours, nor endeavour to discover who or what we are; for, ifthou makest such an attempt, thou wilt come by worse fortune than has yet befallen thee.”Gurth thanked the Captain for his courtesy, and promised to attend to his recommendation. Two of the outlaws, taking up theirquarter-staves, and desiring Gurth to follow close in the rear, walked roundly forward along a by-path, which traversed the thicket andthe broken ground adjacent to it. On the very verge of the thicket two men spoke to his conductors, and receiving an answer in awhisper, withdrew into the wood, and suffered them to pass unmolested. This circumstance induced Gurth to believe both that thegang was strong in numbers, and that they kept regular guards around their place of rendezvous.When they arrived on the open heath, where Gurth might have had some trouble in ﬁnding his road, the thieves guided him straightforward to the top of a little eminence, whence he could see, spread beneath him in the moonlight, the palisades of the lists, theglimmering pavilions pitched at either end, with the pennons which adorned them ﬂuttering in the moonbeams, and from which couldbe heard the hum of the song with which the sentinels were beguiling their night-watch.Here the thieves stopt.“We go with you no farther,” said they; “it were not safe that we should do so.—Remember the warning you have received—keepsecret what has this night befallen you, and you will have no room to repent it—neglect what is now told you, and the Tower ofLondon shall not protect you against our revenge.”“Good night to you, kind sirs,” said Gurth; “I shall remember your orders, and trust that there is no offence in wishing you a saferand an honester trade.”Thus they parted, the outlaws returning in the direction from whence they had come, and Gurth proceeding to the tent of his master,to whom, notwithstanding the injunction he had received, he communicated the whole adventures of the evening.The Disinherited Knight was ﬁlled with astonishment, no less at the generosity of Rebecca, by which, however, he resolved hewould not proﬁt, than that of the robbers, to whose profession such a quality seemed totally foreign. His course of reﬂections uponthese singular circumstances was, however, interrupted by the necessity for taking repose, which the fatigue of the preceding day, andthe propriety of refreshing himself for the morrow’s encounter, rendered alike indispensable.The knight, therefore, stretched himself for repose upon a rich couch with which the tent was provided; and the faithful Gurth,extending his hardy limbs upon a bear-skin which formed a sort of carpet to the pavilion, laid himself across the opening of the tent, sothat no one could enter without awakening him.CHAPTER XIIThe heralds left their pricking up and down,Now ringen trumpets loud and clarion.There is no more to say, but east and west,In go the speares sadly in the rest,In goth the sharp spur into the side,There see men who can just and who can ride;There shiver shaftes upon shieldes thick,He feeleth through the heart-spone the prick;Up springen speares, twenty feet in height,Out go the swordes to the silver bright;The helms they to-hewn and to-shred;Out burst the blood with stern streames red.CHAUCERMorning arose in unclouded splendour, and ere the sun was much above the horizon, the idlest or the most eager of the spectatorsappeared on the common, moving to the lists as to a general centre, in order to secure a favourable situation for viewing thecontinuation of the expected games.The marshals and their attendants appeared next on the ﬁeld, together with the heralds, for the purpose of receiving the names of theknights who intended to joust, with the side which each chose to espouse. This was a necessary precaution, in order to secure equalitybetwixt the two bodies who should be opposed to each other.According to due formality, the Disinherited Knight was to be considered as leader of the one body, while Brian de Bois-Guilbert,who had been rated as having done second-best in the preceding day, was named ﬁrst champion of the other band. Those who hadconcurred in the challenge adhered to his party of course, excepting only Ralph de Vipont, whom his fall had rendered unﬁt so soon toput on his armour. There was no want of distinguished and noble candidates to ﬁll up the ranks on either side.In fact, although the general tournament, in which all knights fought at once, was more dangerous than single encounters, theywere, nevertheless, more frequented and practised by the chivalry of the age. Many knights, who had not sufﬁcient conﬁdence in theirown skill to defy a single adversary of high reputation, were, nevertheless, desirous of displaying their valour in the general combat,where they might meet others with whom they were more upon an equality. On the present occasion, about ﬁfty knights wereinscribed as desirous of combating upon each side, when the marshals declared that no more could be admitted, to the disappointmentof several who were too late in preferring their claim to be included.About the hour of ten o’clock, the whole plain was crowded with horsemen, horsewomen, and foot-passengers, hastening to thetournament; and shortly after, a grand ﬂourish of trumpets announced Prince John and his retinue, attended by many of those knightswho meant to take share in the game, as well as others who had no such intention.About the same time arrived Cedric the Saxon, with the Lady Rowena, unattended, however, by Athelstane. This Saxon lord hadarrayed his tall and strong person in armour, in order to take his place among the combatants; and, considerably to the surprise ofCedric, had chosen to enlist himself on the part of the Knight Templar. The Saxon, indeed, had remonstrated strongly with his friendupon the injudicious choice he had made of his party; but he had only received that sort of answer usually given by those who aremore obstinate in following their own course, than strong in justifying it.His best, if not his only reason, for adhering to the party of Brian de Bois-Guilbert, Athelstane had the prudence to keep to himself.Though his apathy of disposition prevented his taking any means to recommend himself to the Lady Rowena, he was, nevertheless, byno means insensible to her charms, and considered his union with her as a matter already ﬁxed beyond doubt, by the assent of Cedricand her other friends. It had therefore been with smothered displeasure that the proud though indolent Lord of Coningsburgh beheldthe victor of the preceding day select Rowena as the object of that honour which it became his privilege to confer. In order to punishhim for a preference which seemed to interfere with his own suit, Athelstane, conﬁdent of his strength, and to whom his ﬂatterers, atleast, ascribed great skill in arms, had determined not only to deprive the Disinherited Knight of his powerful succour, but, if anopportunity should occur, to make him feel the weight of his battle-axe.De Bracy, and other knights attached to Prince John, in obedience to a hint from him, had joined the party of the challengers, Johnbeing desirous to secure, if possible, the victory to that side. On the other hand, many other knights, both English and Norman, nativesand strangers, took part against the challengers, the more readily that the opposite band was to be led by so distinguished a championas the Disinherited Knight had approved himself.As soon as Prince John observed that the destined Queen of the day had arrived upon the ﬁeld, assuming that air of courtesy whichsat well upon him when he was pleased to exhibit it, he rode forward to meet her, doffed his bonnet, and, alighting from his horse,assisted the Lady Rowena from her saddle, while his followers uncovered at the same time, and one of the most distinguisheddismounted to hold her palfrey.“It is thus,” said Prince John, “that we set the dutiful example of loyalty to the Queen of Love and Beauty, and are ourselves herguide to the throne which she must this day occupy.—Ladies,” he said, “attend your Queen, as you wish in your turn to bedistinguished by like honours.”So saying, the Prince marshalled Rowena to the seat of honour opposite his own, while the fairest and most distinguished ladiespresent crowded after her to obtain places as near as possible to their temporary sovereign.No sooner was Rowena seated, than a burst of music, half-drowned by the shouts of the multitude, greeted her new dignity.Meantime, the sun shone ﬁerce and bright upon the polished arms of the knights of either side, who crowded the opposite extremitiesof the lists, and held eager conference together concerning the best mode of arranging their line of battle, and supporting the conﬂict.The heralds then proclaimed silence until the laws of the tourney should be rehearsed. These were calculated in some degree toabate the dangers of the day; a precaution the more necessary, as the conﬂict was to be maintained with sharp swords and pointedlances.The champions were therefore prohibited to thrust with the sword, and were conﬁned to striking. A knight, it was announced, mightuse a mace or battle-axe at pleasure, but the dagger was a prohibited weapon. A knight unhorsed might renew the ﬁght on foot withany other on the opposite side in the same predicament; but mounted horsemen were in that case forbidden to assail him. When anyknight could force his antagonist to the extremity of the lists, so as to touch the palisade with his person or arms, such opponent wasobliged to yield himself vanquished, and his armour and horse were placed at the disposal of the conqueror. A knight thus overcomewas not permitted to take farther share in the combat. If any combatant was struck down, and unable to recover his feet, his squire orpage might enter the lists, and drag his master out of the press; but in that case the knight was adjudged vanquished, and his arms andhorse declared forfeited. The combat was to cease as soon as Prince John should throw down his leading staff, or truncheon; anotherprecaution usually taken to prevent the unnecessary effusion of blood by the too long endurance of a sport so desperate. Any knightbreaking the rules of the tournament, or otherwise transgressing the rules of honourable chivalry, was liable to be stript of his arms,and, having his shield reversed to be placed in that posture astride upon the bars of the palisade, and exposed to public derision, inpunishment of his unknightly conduct. Having announced these precautions, the heralds concluded with an exhortation to each goodknight to do his duty, and to merit favour from the Queen of Beauty and of Love.This proclamation having been made, the heralds withdrew to their stations. The knights, entering at either end of the lists in longprocession, arranged themselves in a double ﬁle, precisely opposite to each other, the leader of each party being in the centre of theforemost rank, a post which he did not occupy until each had carefully marshalled the ranks of his party, and stationed every one in hisplace.It was a goodly, and at the same time an anxious, sight, to behold so many gallant champions, mounted bravely, and armed richly,stand ready prepared for an encounter so formidable, seated on their war-saddles like so many pillars of iron, and awaiting the signalof encounter with the same ardour as their generous steeds, which, by neighing and pawing the ground, gave signal of theirimpatience.As yet the knights held their long lances upright, their bright points glancing to the sun, and the streamers with which they weredecorated ﬂuttering over the plumage of the helmets. Thus they remained while the marshals of the ﬁeld surveyed their ranks with theutmost exactness, lest either party had more or fewer than the appointed number. The tale was found exactly complete. The marshalsthen withdrew from the lists, and William de Wyvil, with a voice of thunder, pronounced the signal words—“Laissez aller!” Thetrumpets sounded as he spoke—the spears of the champions were at once lowered and placed in the rests—the spurs were dashed intothe ﬂanks of the horses, and the two foremost ranks of either party rushed upon each other in full gallop, and met in the middle of thelists with a shock, the sound of which was heard at a mile’s distance. The rear rank of each party advanced at a slower pace to sustainthe defeated, and follow up the success of the victors of their party.The consequences of the encounter were not instantly seen, for the dust raised by the trampling of so many steeds darkened the air,and it was a minute ere the anxious spectator could see the fate of the encounter. When the ﬁght became visible, half the knights oneach side were dismounted, some by the dexterity of their adversary’s lance,—some by the superior weight and strength of opponents,which had borne down both horse and man,—some lay stretched on earth as if never more to rise,—some had already gained theirfeet, and were closing hand to hand with those of their antagonists who were in the same predicament,—and several on both sides,who had received wounds by which they were disabled, were stopping their blood by their scarfs, and endeavouring to extricatethemselves from the tumult. The mounted knights, whose lances had been almost all broken by the fury of the encounter, were nowclosely engaged with their swords, shouting their war-cries, and exchanging buffets, as if honour and life depended on the issue of thecombat.The tumult was presently increased by the advance of the second rank on either side, which, acting as a reserve, now rushed on toaid their companions. The followers of Brian de Bois-Guilbert shouted—“Ha! Beau-seant! Beau-seant! 20“—For the Temple—For the Temple!” The opposite party shouted in answer—“Desdichado! Desdichado!”—which watch-wordthey took from the motto upon their leader’s shield.The champions thus encountering each other with the utmost fury, and with alternate success, the tide of battle seemed to ﬂow nowtoward the southern, now toward the northern extremity of the lists, as the one or the other party prevailed. Meantime the clang of theblows, and the shouts of the combatants, mixed fearfully with the sound of the trumpets, and drowned the groans of those who fell,and lay rolling defenceless beneath the feet of the horses. The splendid armour of the combatants was now defaced with dust andblood, and gave way at every stroke of the sword and battle-axe. The gay plumage, shorn from the crests, drifted upon the breeze likesnow-ﬂakes. All that was beautiful and graceful in the martial array had disappeared, and what was now visible was only calculated toawake terror or compassion.Yet such is the force of habit, that not only the vulgar spectators, who are naturally attracted by sights of horror, but even the ladiesof distinction who crowded the galleries, saw the conﬂict with a thrilling interest certainly, but without a wish to withdraw their eyesfrom a sight so terrible. Here and there, indeed, a fair cheek might turn pale, or a faint scream might be heard, as a lover, a brother, or ahusband, was struck from his horse. But, in general, the ladies around encouraged the combatants, not only by clapping their handsand waving their veils and kerchiefs, but even by exclaiming, “Brave lance! Good sword!” when any successful thrust or blow tookplace under their observation.Such being the interest taken by the fair sex in this bloody game, that of the men is the more easily understood. It showed itself inloud acclamations upon every change of fortune, while all eyes were so riveted on the lists, that the spectators seemed as if theythemselves had dealt and received the blows which were there so freely bestowed. And between every pause was heard the voice ofthe heralds, exclaiming, “Fight on, brave knights! Man dies, but glory lives!—Fight on—death is better than defeat!—Fight on, braveknights!—for bright eyes behold your deeds!”Amid the varied fortunes of the combat, the eyes of all endeavoured to discover the leaders of each band, who, mingling in the thickof the ﬁght, encouraged their companions both by voice and example. Both displayed great feats of gallantry, nor did either Bois-Guilbert or the Disinherited Knight ﬁnd in the ranks opposed to them a champion who could be termed their unquestioned match.They repeatedly endeavoured to single out each other, spurred by mutual animosity, and aware that the fall of either leader might beconsidered as decisive of victory. Such, however, was the crowd and confusion, that, during the earlier part of the conﬂict, their effortsto meet were unavailing, and they were repeatedly separated by the eagerness of their followers, each of whom was anxious to winhonour, by measuring his strength against the leader of the opposite party.But when the ﬁeld became thin by the numbers on either side who had yielded themselves vanquished, had been compelled to theextremity of the lists, or been otherwise rendered incapable of continuing the strife, the Templar and the Disinherited Knight at lengthencountered hand to hand, with all the fury that mortal animosity, joined to rivalry of honour, could inspire. Such was the address ofeach in parrying and striking, that the spectators broke forth into a unanimous and involuntary shout, expressive of their delight andadmiration.But at this moment the party of the Disinherited Knight had the worst; the gigantic arm of Front-de-Bœuf on the one ﬂank, and theponderous strength of Athelstane on the other, bearing down and dispersing those immediately exposed to them. Finding themselvesfreed from their immediate antagonists, it seems to have occurred to both these knights at the same instant, that they would render themost decisive advantage to their party, by aiding the Templar in his contest with his rival. Turning their horses, therefore, at the samemoment, the Norman spurred against the Disinherited Knight on the one side, and the Saxon on the other. It was utterly impossiblethat the object of this unequal and unexpected assault could have sustained it, had he not been warned by a general cry from thespectators, who could not but take interest in one exposed to such disadvantage.“Beware! beware! Sir Disinherited!” was shouted so universally, that the knight became aware of his danger; and, striking a fullblow at the Templar, he reined back his steed in the same moment, so as to escape the charge of Athelstane and Front-de-Bœuf. Theseknights, therefore, their aim being thus eluded, rushed from opposite sides betwixt the object of their attack and the Templar, almostrunning their horses against each other ere they could stop their career. Recovering their horses however, and wheeling them round,the whole three pursued their united purpose of bearing to the earth the Disinherited Knight.Nothing could have saved him, except the remarkable strength and activity of the noble horse which he had won on the precedingday.This stood him in the more stead, as the horse of Bois-Guilbert was wounded, and those of Front-de-Bœuf and Athelstane were bothtired with the weight of their gigantic masters, clad in complete armour, and with the preceding exertions of the day. The masterlyhorsemanship of the Disinherited Knight, and the activity of the noble animal which he mounted, enabled him for a few minutes tokeep at sword’s point his three antagonists, turning and wheeling with the agility of a hawk upon the wing, keeping his enemies as farseparate as he could, and rushing now against the one, now against the other, dealing sweeping blows with his sword, without waitingto receive those which were aimed at him in return.But although the lists rang with the applauses of his dexterity, it was evident that he must at last be overpowered; and the noblesaround Prince John implored him with one voice to throw down his warder, and to save so brave a knight from the disgrace of beingovercome by odds.“Not I, by the light of Heaven!” answered Prince John; “this same springald, who conceals his name, and despises our profferedhospitality, hath already gained one prize, and may now afford to let others have their turn.” As he spoke thus, an unexpected incidentchanged the fortune of the day.There was among the ranks of the Disinherited Knight a champion in black armour, mounted on a black horse, large of size, tall,and to all appearance powerful and strong, like the rider by whom he was mounted. This knight, who bore on his shield no device ofany kind, had hitherto evinced very little interest in the event of the ﬁght, beating off with seeming ease those combatants whoattacked him, but neither pursuing his advantages, nor himself assailing any one. In short, he had hitherto acted the part rather of aspectator than of a party in the tournament, a circumstance which procured him among the spectators the name of “Le Noir Faineant”,or the Black Sluggard.At once this knight seemed to throw aside his apathy, when he discovered the leader of his party so hard bestead; for, setting spursto his horse, which was quite fresh, he came to his assistance like a thunderbolt, exclaiming, in a voice like a trumpet-call,“Desdichado, to the rescue!” It was high time; for, while the Disinherited Knight was pressing upon the Templar, Front-de-Bœuf hadgot nigh to him with his uplifted sword; but ere the blow could descend, the Sable Knight dealt a stroke on his head, which, glancingfrom the polished helmet, lighted with violence scarcely abated on the “chamfron” of the steed, and Front-de-Bœuf rolled on theground, both horse and man equally stunned by the fury of the blow. “Le Noir Faineant” then turned his horse upon Athelstane ofConingsburgh; and his own sword having been broken in his encounter with Front-de-Bœuf, he wrenched from the hand of the bulkySaxon the battle-axe which he wielded, and, like one familiar with the use of the weapon, bestowed him such a blow upon the crest,that Athelstane also lay senseless on the ﬁeld. Having achieved this double feat, for which he was the more highly applauded that itwas totally unexpected from him, the knight seemed to resume the sluggishness of his character, returning calmly to the northernextremity of the lists, leaving his leader to cope as he best could with Brian de Bois-Guilbert. This was no longer matter of so muchdifﬁculty as formerly. The Templars horse had bled much, and gave way under the shock of the Disinherited Knight’s charge. Brian deBois-Guilbert rolled on the ﬁeld, encumbered with the stirrup, from which he was unable to draw his foot. His antagonist sprung fromhorseback, waved his fatal sword over the head of his adversary, and commanded him to yield himself; when Prince John, moremoved by the Templars dangerous situation than he had been by that of his rival, saved him the mortiﬁcation of confessing himselfvanquished, by casting down his warder, and putting an end to the conﬂict.It was, indeed, only the relics and embers of the ﬁght which continued to burn; for of the few knights who still continued in the lists,the greater part had, by tacit consent, forborne the conﬂict for some time, leaving it to be determined by the strife of the leaders.The squires, who had found it a matter of danger and difﬁculty to attend their masters during the engagement, now thronged into thelists to pay their dutiful attendance to the wounded, who were removed with the utmost care and attention to the neighbouringpavilions, or to the quarters prepared for them in the adjoining village.Thus ended the memorable ﬁeld of Ashby-de-la-Zouche, one of the most gallantly contested tournaments of that age; for althoughonly four knights, including one who was smothered by the heat of his armour, had died upon the ﬁeld, yet upwards of thirty weredesperately wounded, four or ﬁve of whom never recovered. Several more were disabled for life; and those who escaped best carriedthe marks of the conﬂict to the grave with them. Hence it is always mentioned in the old records, as the Gentle and Joyous Passage ofArms of Ashby.It being now the duty of Prince John to name the knight who had done best, he determined that the honour of the day remained withthe knight whom the popular voice had termed “Le Noir Faineant.” It was pointed out to the Prince, in impeachment of this decree,that the victory had been in fact won by the Disinherited Knight, who, in the course of the day, had overcome six champions with hisown hand, and who had ﬁnally unhorsed and struck down the leader of the opposite party. But Prince John adhered to his own opinion,on the ground that the Disinherited Knight and his party had lost the day, but for the powerful assistance of the Knight of the BlackArmour, to whom, therefore, he persisted in awarding the prize.To the surprise of all present, however, the knight thus preferred was nowhere to be found. He had left the lists immediately whenthe conﬂict ceased, and had been observed by some spectators to move down one of the forest glades with the same slow pace andlistless and indifferent manner which had procured him the epithet of the Black Sluggard. After he had been summoned twice bysound of trumpet, and proclamation of the heralds, it became necessary to name another to receive the honours which had beenassigned to him. Prince John had now no further excuse for resisting the claim of the Disinherited Knight, whom, therefore, he namedthe champion of the day.Through a ﬁeld slippery with blood, and encumbered with broken armour and the bodies of slain and wounded horses, the marshalsof the lists again conducted the victor to the foot of Prince John’s throne.“Disinherited Knight,” said Prince John, “since by that title only you will consent to be known to us, we a second time award to youthe honours of this tournament, and announce to you your right to claim and receive from the hands of the Queen of Love and Beauty,the Chaplet of Honour which your valour has justly deserved.” The Knight bowed low and gracefully, but returned no answer.While the trumpets sounded, while the heralds strained their voices in proclaiming honour to the brave and glory to the victor—while ladies waved their silken kerchiefs and embroidered veils, and while all ranks joined in a clamorous shout of exultation, themarshals conducted the Disinherited Knight across the lists to the foot of that throne of honour which was occupied by the LadyRowena.On the lower step of this throne the champion was made to kneel down. Indeed his whole action since the ﬁght had ended, seemedrather to have been upon the impulse of those around him than from his own free will; and it was observed that he tottered as theyguided him the second time across the lists. Rowena, descending from her station with a graceful and digniﬁed step, was about toplace the chaplet which she held in her hand upon the helmet of the champion, when the marshals exclaimed with one voice, “It mustnot be thus—his head must be bare.” The knight muttered faintly a few words, which were lost in the hollow of his helmet, but theirpurport seemed to be a desire that his casque might not be removed.Whether from love of form, or from curiosity, the marshals paid no attention to his expressions of reluctance, but unhelmed him bycutting the laces of his casque, and undoing the fastening of his gorget. When the helmet was removed, the well-formed, yet sun-burntfeatures of a young man of twenty-ﬁve were seen, amidst a profusion of short fair hair. His countenance was as pale as death, andmarked in one or two places with streaks of blood.
Rowena had no sooner beheld him than she uttered a faint shriek; but at once summoning up the energy of her disposition, andcompelling herself, as it were, to proceed, while her frame yet trembled with the violence of sudden emotion, she placed upon thedrooping head of the victor the splendid chaplet which was the destined reward of the day, and pronounced, in a clear and distincttone, these words: “I bestow on thee this chaplet, Sir Knight, as the meed of valour assigned to this day’s victor:” Here she paused amoment, and then ﬁrmly added, “And upon brows more worthy could a wreath of chivalry never be placed!”The knight stooped his head, and kissed the hand of the lovely Sovereign by whom his valour had been rewarded; and then, sinkingyet farther forward, lay prostrate at her feet.There was a general consternation. Cedric, who had been struck mute by the sudden appearance of his banished son, now rushedforward, as if to separate him from Rowena. But this had been already accomplished by the marshals of the ﬁeld, who, guessing thecause of Ivanhoe’s swoon, had hastened to undo his armour, and found that the head of a lance had penetrated his breastplate, andinﬂicted a wound in his side.CHAPTER XIII“Heroes, approach!” Atrides thus aloud,“Stand forth distinguish’d from the circling crowd,Ye who by skill or manly force may claim,Your rivals to surpass and merit fame.This cow, worth twenty oxen, is decreed,For him who farthest sends the winged reed.”ILIADThe name of Ivanhoe was no sooner pronounced than it ﬂew from mouth to mouth, with all the celerity with which eagerness couldconvey and curiosity receive it. It was not long ere it reached the circle of the Prince, whose brow darkened as he heard the news.Looking around him, however, with an air of scorn, “My Lords,” said he, “and especially you, Sir Prior, what think ye of the doctrinethe learned tell us, concerning innate attractions and antipathies? Methinks that I felt the presence of my brother’s minion, even when Ileast guessed whom yonder suit of armour enclosed.”“Front-de-Bœuf must prepare to restore his ﬁef of Ivanhoe,” said De Bracy, who, having discharged his part honourably in thetournament, had laid his shield and helmet aside, and again mingled with the Prince’s retinue.“Ay,” answered Waldemar Fitzurse, “this gallant is likely to reclaim the castle and manor which Richard assigned to him, and whichyour Highness’s generosity has since given to Front-de-Bœuf.”“Front-de-Bœuf,” replied John, “is a man more willing to swallow three manors such as Ivanhoe, than to disgorge one of them. Forthe rest, sirs, I hope none here will deny my right to confer the ﬁefs of the crown upon the faithful followers who are around me, andready to perform the usual military service, in the room of those who have wandered to foreign Countries, and can neither renderhomage nor service when called upon.”The audience were too much interested in the question not to pronounce the Prince’s assumed right altogether indubitable. “Agenerous Prince!—a most noble Lord, who thus takes upon himself the task of rewarding his faithful followers!”Such were the words which burst from the train, expectants all of them of similar grants at the expense of King Richard’s followersand favourites, if indeed they had not as yet received such. Prior Aymer also assented to the general proposition, observing, however,“That the blessed Jerusalem could not indeed be termed a foreign country. She was ‘communis mater’—the mother of all Christians.But he saw not,” he declared, “how the Knight of Ivanhoe could plead any advantage from this, since he” (the Prior) “was assured thatthe crusaders, under Richard, had never proceeded much farther than Askalon, which, as all the world knew, was a town of thePhilistines, and entitled to none of the privileges of the Holy City.”Waldemar, whose curiosity had led him towards the place where Ivanhoe had fallen to the ground, now returned. “The gallant,” saidhe, “is likely to give your Highness little disturbance, and to leave Front-de-Bœuf in the quiet possession of his gains—he is severelywounded.”“Whatever becomes of him,” said Prince John, “he is victor of the day; and were he tenfold our enemy, or the devoted friend of ourbrother, which is perhaps the same, his wounds must be looked to—our own physician shall attend him.”A stern smile curled the Prince’s lip as he spoke. Waldemar Fitzurse hastened to reply, that Ivanhoe was already removed from thelists, and in the custody of his friends.“I was somewhat afﬂicted,” he said, “to see the grief of the Queen of Love and Beauty, whose sovereignty of a day this event haschanged into mourning. I am not a man to be moved by a woman’s lament for her lover, but this same Lady Rowena suppressed hersorrow with such dignity of manner, that it could only be discovered by her folded hands, and her tearless eye, which trembled as itremained ﬁxed on the lifeless form before her.”“Who is this Lady Rowena,” said Prince John, “of whom we have heard so much?”“A Saxon heiress of large possessions,” replied the Prior Aymer; “a rose of loveliness, and a jewel of wealth; the fairest among athousand, a bundle of myrrh, and a cluster of camphire.”“We shall cheer her sorrows,” said Prince John, “and amend her blood, by wedding her to a Norman. She seems a minor, and musttherefore be at our royal disposal in marriage.—How sayst thou, De Bracy? What thinkst thou of gaining fair lands and livings, bywedding a Saxon, after the fashion of the followers of the Conqueror?”“If the lands are to my liking, my lord,” answered De Bracy, “it will be hard to displease me with a bride; and deeply will I holdmyself bound to your highness for a good deed, which will fulﬁl all promises made in favour of your servant and vassal.”“We will not forget it,” said Prince John; “and that we may instantly go to work, command our seneschal presently to order theattendance of the Lady Rowena and her company—that is, the rude churl her guardian, and the Saxon ox whom the Black Knightstruck down in the tournament, upon this evening’s banquet.—De Bigot,” he added to his seneschal, “thou wilt word this our secondsummons so courteously, as to gratify the pride of these Saxons, and make it impossible for them again to refuse; although, by thebones of Becket, courtesy to them is casting pearls before swine.”Prince John had proceeded thus far, and was about to give the signal for retiring from the lists, when a small billet was put into hishand.“From whence?” said Prince John, looking at the person by whom it was delivered.“From foreign parts, my lord, but from whence I know not” replied his attendant. “A Frenchman brought it hither, who said, he hadridden night and day to put it into the hands of your highness.”The Prince looked narrowly at the superscription, and then at the seal, placed so as to secure the ﬂex-silk with which the billet wassurrounded, and which bore the impression of three ﬂeurs-de-lis. John then opened the billet with apparent agitation, which visibly andgreatly increased when he had perused the contents, which were expressed in these words:“Take heed to yourself for the Devil is unchained!”The Prince turned as pale as death, looked ﬁrst on the earth, and then up to heaven, like a man who has received news that sentenceof execution has been passed upon him. Recovering from the ﬁrst effects of his surprise, he took Waldemar Fitzurse and De Bracyaside, and put the billet into their hands successively. “It means,” he added, in a faltering voice, “that my brother Richard has obtainedhis freedom.”“This may be a false alarm, or a forged letter,” said De Bracy.“It is France’s own hand and seal,” replied Prince John.“It is time, then,” said Fitzurse, “to draw our party to a head, either at York, or some other centrical place. A few days later, and itwill be indeed too late. Your highness must break short this present mummery.”“The yeomen and commons,” said De Bracy, “must not be dismissed discontented, for lack of their share in the sports.”“The day,” said Waldemar, “is not yet very far spent—let the archers shoot a few rounds at the target, and the prize be adjudged.This will be an abundant fulﬁlment of the Prince’s promises, so far as this herd of Saxon serfs is concerned.”“I thank thee, Waldemar,” said the Prince; “thou remindest me, too, that I have a debt to pay to that insolent peasant who yesterdayinsulted our person. Our banquet also shall go forward to-night as we proposed. Were this my last hour of power, it should be an hoursacred to revenge and to pleasure—let new cares come with to-morrow’s new day.”The sound of the trumpets soon recalled those spectators who had already begun to leave the ﬁeld; and proclamation was made thatPrince John, suddenly called by high and peremptory public duties, held himself obliged to discontinue the entertainments of to-morrow’s festival: Nevertheless, that, unwilling so many good yeoman should depart without a trial of skill, he was pleased to appointthem, before leaving the ground, presently to execute the competition of archery intended for the morrow. To the best archer a prizewas to be awarded, being a bugle-horn, mounted with silver, and a silken baldric richly ornamented with a medallion of St Hubert, thepatron of silvan sport.More than thirty yeomen at ﬁrst presented themselves as competitors, several of whom were rangers and under-keepers in the royalforests of Needwood and Charnwood. When, however, the archers understood with whom they were to be matched, upwards oftwenty withdrew themselves from the contest, unwilling to encounter the dishonour of almost certain defeat. For in those days the skillof each celebrated marksman was as well known for many miles round him, as the qualities of a horse trained at Newmarket arefamiliar to those who frequent that well-known meeting.The diminished list of competitors for silvan fame still amounted to eight. Prince John stepped from his royal seat to view morenearly the persons of these chosen yeomen, several of whom wore the royal livery. Having satisﬁed his curiosity by this investigation,he looked for the object of his resentment, whom he observed standing on the same spot, and with the same composed countenancewhich he had exhibited upon the preceding day.“Fellow,” said Prince John, “I guessed by thy insolent babble that thou wert no true lover of the longbow, and I see thou darest notadventure thy skill among such merry-men as stand yonder.”“Under favour, sir,” replied the yeoman, “I have another reason for refraining to shoot, besides the fearing discomﬁture anddisgrace.”“And what is thy other reason?” said Prince John, who, for some cause which perhaps he could not himself have explained, felt apainful curiosity respecting this individual.“Because,” replied the woodsman, “I know not if these yeomen and I are used to shoot at the same marks; and because, moreover, Iknow not how your Grace might relish the winning of a third prize by one who has unwittingly fallen under your displeasure.”Prince John coloured as he put the question, “What is thy name, yeoman?”“Locksley,” answered the yeoman.“Then, Locksley,” said Prince John, “thou shalt shoot in thy turn, when these yeomen have displayed their skill. If thou carriest theprize, I will add to it twenty nobles; but if thou losest it, thou shalt be stript of thy Lincoln green, and scourged out of the lists withbowstrings, for a wordy and insolent braggart.”“And how if I refuse to shoot on such a wager?” said the yeoman.—“Your Grace’s power, supported, as it is, by so many men-at-arms, may indeed easily strip and scourge me, but cannot compel me to bend or to draw my bow.”“If thou refusest my fair proffer,” said the Prince, “the Provost of the lists shall cut thy bowstring, break thy bow and arrows, andexpel thee from the presence as a faint-hearted craven.”“This is no fair chance you put on me, proud Prince,” said the yeoman, “to compel me to peril myself against the best archers ofLeicester and Staffordshire, under the penalty of infamy if they should overshoot me. Nevertheless, I will obey your pleasure.”“Look to him close, men-at-arms,” said Prince John, “his heart is sinking; I am jealous lest he attempt to escape the trial.—And doyou, good fellows, shoot boldly round; a buck and a butt of wine are ready for your refreshment in yonder tent, when the prize iswon.”A target was placed at the upper end of the southern avenue which led to the lists. The contending archers took their station in turn,at the bottom of the southern access, the distance between that station and the mark allowing full distance for what was called a shot atrovers. The archers, having previously determined by lot their order of precedence, were to shoot each three shafts in succession. Thesports were regulated by an ofﬁcer of inferior rank, termed the Provost of the Games; for the high rank of the marshals of the listswould have been held degraded, had they condescended to superintend the sports of the yeomanry.One by one the archers, stepping forward, delivered their shafts yeomanlike and bravely. Of twenty-four arrows, shot in succession,ten were ﬁxed in the target, and the others ranged so near it, that, considering the distance of the mark, it was accounted good archery.Of the ten shafts which hit the target, two within the inner ring were shot by Hubert, a forester in the service of Malvoisin, who wasaccordingly pronounced victorious.“Now, Locksley,” said Prince John to the bold yeoman, with a bitter smile, “wilt thou try conclusions with Hubert, or wilt thou yieldup bow, baldric, and quiver, to the Provost of the sports?”“Sith it be no better,” said Locksley, “I am content to try my fortune; on condition that when I have shot two shafts at yonder markof Hubert’s, he shall be bound to shoot one at that which I shall propose.”“That is but fair,” answered Prince John, “and it shall not be refused thee.—If thou dost beat this braggart, Hubert, I will ﬁll thebugle with silver-pennies for thee.”“A man can do but his best,” answered Hubert; “but my grandsire drew a good long bow at Hastings, and I trust not to dishonour hismemory.”The former target was now removed, and a fresh one of the same size placed in its room. Hubert, who, as victor in the ﬁrst trial ofskill, had the right to shoot ﬁrst, took his aim with great deliberation, long measuring the distance with his eye, while he held in hishand his bended bow, with the arrow placed on the string. At length he made a step forward, and raising the bow at the full stretch ofhis left arm, till the centre or grasping-place was nigh level with his face, he drew his bowstring to his ear. The arrow whistled throughthe air, and lighted within the inner ring of the target, but not exactly in the centre.“You have not allowed for the wind, Hubert,” said his antagonist, bending his bow, “or that had been a better shot.”So saying, and without showing the least anxiety to pause upon his aim, Locksley stept to the appointed station, and shot his arrowas carelessly in appearance as if he had not even looked at the mark. He was speaking almost at the instant that the shaft left thebowstring, yet it alighted in the target two inches nearer to the white spot which marked the centre than that of Hubert.
“By the light of heaven!” said Prince John to Hubert, “an thou suffer that runagate knave to overcome thee, thou art worthy of thegallows!”Hubert had but one set speech for all occasions. “An your highness were to hang me,” he said, “a man can but do his best.Nevertheless, my grandsire drew a good bow—”“The foul ﬁend on thy grandsire and all his generation!” interrupted John, “shoot, knave, and shoot thy best, or it shall be the worsefor thee!”Thus exhorted, Hubert resumed his place, and not neglecting the caution which he had received from his adversary, he made thenecessary allowance for a very light air of wind, which had just arisen, and shot so successfully that his arrow alighted in the verycentre of the target.“A Hubert! a Hubert!” shouted the populace, more interested in a known person than in a stranger. “In the clout!—in the clout!—aHubert for ever!”“Thou canst not mend that shot, Locksley,” said the Prince, with an insulting smile.“I will notch his shaft for him, however,” replied Locksley.And letting ﬂy his arrow with a little more precaution than before, it lighted right upon that of his competitor, which it split toshivers. The people who stood around were so astonished at his wonderful dexterity, that they could not even give vent to theirsurprise in their usual clamour. “This must be the devil, and no man of ﬂesh and blood,” whispered the yeomen to each other; “sucharchery was never seen since a bow was ﬁrst bent in Britain.”“And now,” said Locksley, “I will crave your Grace’s permission to plant such a mark as is used in the North Country; and welcomeevery brave yeoman who shall try a shot at it to win a smile from the bonny lass he loves best.”He then turned to leave the lists. “Let your guards attend me,” he said, “if you please—I go but to cut a rod from the next willow-bush.”Prince John made a signal that some attendants should follow him in case of his escape: but the cry of “Shame! shame!” whichburst from the multitude, induced him to alter his ungenerous purpose.Locksley returned almost instantly with a willow wand about six feet in length, perfectly straight, and rather thicker than a man’sthumb. He began to peel this with great composure, observing at the same time, that to ask a good woodsman to shoot at a target sobroad as had hitherto been used, was to put shame upon his skill. “For his own part,” he said, “and in the land where he was bred, menwould as soon take for their mark King Arthur’s round-table, which held sixty knights around it. A child of seven years old,” he said,“might hit yonder target with a headless shaft; but,” added he, walking deliberately to the other end of the lists, and sticking the willowwand upright in the ground, “he that hits that rod at ﬁve-score yards, I call him an archer ﬁt to bear both bow and quiver before a king,an it were the stout King Richard himself.”“My grandsire,” said Hubert, “drew a good bow at the battle of Hastings, and never shot at such a mark in his life—and neither willI. If this yeoman can cleave that rod, I give him the bucklers—or rather, I yield to the devil that is in his jerkin, and not to any humanskill; a man can but do his best, and I will not shoot where I am sure to miss. I might as well shoot at the edge of our parson’s whittle,or at a wheat straw, or at a sunbeam, as at a twinkling white streak which I can hardly see.”“Cowardly dog!” said Prince John.—“Sirrah Locksley, do thou shoot; but, if thou hittest such a mark, I will say thou art the ﬁrstman ever did so. However it be, thou shalt not crow over us with a mere show of superior skill.”“I will do my best, as Hubert says,” answered Locksley; “no man can do more.”So saying, he again bent his bow, but on the present occasion looked with attention to his weapon, and changed the string, which hethought was no longer truly round, having been a little frayed by the two former shots. He then took his aim with some deliberation,and the multitude awaited the event in breathless silence. The archer vindicated their opinion of his skill: his arrow split the willow rodagainst which it was aimed. A jubilee of acclamations followed; and even Prince John, in admiration of Locksley’s skill, lost for aninstant his dislike to his person. “These twenty nobles,” he said, “which, with the bugle, thou hast fairly won, are thine own; we willmake them ﬁfty, if thou wilt take livery and service with us as a yeoman of our body guard, and be near to our person. For never did sostrong a hand bend a bow, or so true an eye direct a shaft.”“Pardon me, noble Prince,” said Locksley; “but I have vowed, that if ever I take service, it should be with your royal brother KingRichard. These twenty nobles I leave to Hubert, who has this day drawn as brave a bow as his grandsire did at Hastings. Had hismodesty not refused the trial, he would have hit the wand as well I.”Hubert shook his head as he received with reluctance the bounty of the stranger, and Locksley, anxious to escape furtherobservation, mixed with the crowd, and was seen no more.The victorious archer would not perhaps have escaped John’s attention so easily, had not that Prince had other subjects of anxiousand more important meditation pressing upon his mind at that instant. He called upon his chamberlain as he gave the signal for retiringfrom the lists, and commanded him instantly to gallop to Ashby, and seek out Isaac the Jew. “Tell the dog,” he said, “to send me,before sun-down, two thousand crowns. He knows the security; but thou mayst show him this ring for a token. The rest of the moneymust be paid at York within six days. If he neglects, I will have the unbelieving villain’s head. Look that thou pass him not on the way;for the circumcised slave was displaying his stolen ﬁnery amongst us.”So saying, the Prince resumed his horse, and returned to Ashby, the whole crowd breaking up and dispersing upon his retreat.CHAPTER XIVIn rough magniﬁcence array’d,When ancient Chivalry display’dThe pomp of her heroic games,And crested chiefs and tissued damesAssembled, at the clarion’s call,In some proud castle’s high arch’d hall.WARTONPrince John held his high festival in the Castle of Ashby. This was not the same building of which the stately ruins still interest thetraveller, and which was erected at a later period by the Lord Hastings, High Chamberlain of England, one of the ﬁrst victims of thetyranny of Richard the Third, and yet better known as one of Shakespeare’s characters than by his historical fame. The castle and townof Ashby, at this time, belonged to Roger de Quincy, Earl of Winchester, who, during the period of our history, was absent in the HolyLand. Prince John, in the meanwhile, occupied his castle, and disposed of his domains without scruple; and seeking at present todazzle men’s eyes by his hospitality and magniﬁcence, had given orders for great preparations, in order to render the banquet assplendid as possible.The purveyors of the Prince, who exercised on this and other occasions the full authority of royalty, had swept the country of all thatcould be collected which was esteemed ﬁt for their master’s table. Guests also were invited in great numbers; and in the necessity inwhich he then found himself of courting popularity, Prince John had extended his invitation to a few distinguished Saxon and Danishfamilies, as well as to the Norman nobility and gentry of the neighbourhood. However despised and degraded on ordinary occasions,the great numbers of the Anglo-Saxons must necessarily render them formidable in the civil commotions which seemed approaching,and it was an obvious point of policy to secure popularity with their leaders.It was accordingly the Prince’s intention, which he for some time maintained, to treat these unwonted guests with a courtesy towhich they had been little accustomed. But although no man with less scruple made his ordinary habits and feelings bend to hisinterest, it was the misfortune of this Prince, that his levity and petulance were perpetually breaking out, and undoing all that had beengained by his previous dissimulation.Of this ﬁckle temper he gave a memorable example in Ireland, when sent thither by his father, Henry the Second, with the purposeof buying golden opinions of the inhabitants of that new and important acquisition to the English crown. Upon this occasion the Irishchieftains contended which should ﬁrst offer to the young Prince their loyal homage and the kiss of peace. But, instead of receivingtheir salutations with courtesy, John and his petulant attendants could not resist the temptation of pulling the long beards of the Irishchieftains; a conduct which, as might have been expected, was highly resented by these insulted dignitaries, and produced fatalconsequences to the English domination in Ireland. It is necessary to keep these inconsistencies of John’s character in view, that thereader may understand his conduct during the present evening.In execution of the resolution which he had formed during his cooler moments, Prince John received Cedric and Athelstane withdistinguished courtesy, and expressed his disappointment, without resentment, when the indisposition of Rowena was alleged by theformer as a reason for her not attending upon his gracious summons. Cedric and Athelstane were both dressed in the ancient Saxongarb, which, although not unhandsome in itself, and in the present instance composed of costly materials, was so remote in shape andappearance from that of the other guests, that Prince John took great credit to himself with Waldemar Fitzurse for refraining fromlaughter at a sight which the fashion of the day rendered ridiculous. Yet, in the eye of sober judgment, the short close tunic and longmantle of the Saxons was a more graceful, as well as a more convenient dress, than the garb of the Normans, whose under garmentwas a long doublet, so loose as to resemble a shirt or waggoner’s frock, covered by a cloak of scanty dimensions, neither ﬁt to defendthe wearer from cold or from rain, and the only purpose of which appeared to be to display as much fur, embroidery, and jewellerywork, as the ingenuity of the tailor could contrive to lay upon it. The Emperor Charlemagne, in whose reign they were ﬁrst introduced,seems to have been very sensible of the inconveniences arising from the fashion of this garment. “In Heaven’s name,” said he, “towhat purpose serve these abridged cloaks? If we are in bed they are no cover, on horseback they are no protection from the wind andrain, and when seated, they do not guard our legs from the damp or the frost.”Nevertheless, spite of this imperial objurgation, the short cloaks continued in fashion down to the time of which we treat, andparticularly among the princes of the House of Anjou. They were therefore in universal use among Prince John’s courtiers; and thelong mantle, which formed the upper garment of the Saxons, was held in proportional derision.The guests were seated at a table which groaned under the quantity of good cheer. The numerous cooks who attended on thePrince’s progress, having exerted all their art in varying the forms in which the ordinary provisions were served up, had succeededalmost as well as the modern professors of the culinary art in rendering them perfectly unlike their natural appearance. Besides thesedishes of domestic origin, there were various delicacies brought from foreign parts, and a quantity of rich pastry, as well as of thesimnel-bread and wastle cakes, which were only used at the tables of the highest nobility. The banquet was crowned with the richestwines, both foreign and domestic.But, though luxurious, the Norman nobles were not generally speaking an intemperate race. While indulging themselves in thepleasures of the table, they aimed at delicacy, but avoided excess, and were apt to attribute gluttony and drunkenness to the vanquishedSaxons, as vices peculiar to their inferior station. Prince John, indeed, and those who courted his pleasure by imitating his foibles,were apt to indulge to excess in the pleasures of the trencher and the goblet; and indeed it is well known that his death was occasionedby a surfeit upon peaches and new ale. His conduct, however, was an exception to the general manners of his countrymen.With sly gravity, interrupted only by private signs to each other, the Norman knights and nobles beheld the ruder demeanour ofAthelstane and Cedric at a banquet, to the form and fashion of which they were unaccustomed. And while their manners were thus thesubject of sarcastic observation, the untaught Saxons unwittingly transgressed several of the arbitrary rules established for theregulation of society. Now, it is well known, that a man may with more impunity be guilty of an actual breach either of real goodbreeding or of good morals, than appear ignorant of the most minute point of fashionable etiquette. Thus Cedric, who dried his handswith a towel, instead of suffering the moisture to exhale by waving them gracefully in the air, incurred more ridicule than hiscompanion Athelstane, when he swallowed to his own single share the whole of a large pasty composed of the most exquisite foreigndelicacies, and termed at that time a “Karum-Pie”. When, however, it was discovered, by a serious cross-examination, that the Thaneof Coningsburgh (or Franklin, as the Normans termed him) had no idea what he had been devouring, and that he had taken thecontents of the Karum-pie for larks and pigeons, whereas they were in fact beccaﬁcoes and nightingales, his ignorance brought him infor an ample share of the ridicule which would have been more justly bestowed on his gluttony.The long feast had at length its end; and, while the goblet circulated freely, men talked of the feats of the preceding tournament,—ofthe unknown victor in the archery games, of the Black Knight, whose self-denial had induced him to withdraw from the honours hehad won,—and of the gallant Ivanhoe, who had so dearly bought the honours of the day. The topics were treated with militaryfrankness, and the jest and laugh went round the hall. The brow of Prince John alone was overclouded during these discussions; someoverpowering care seemed agitating his mind, and it was only when he received occasional hints from his attendants, that he seemedto take interest in what was passing around him. On such occasions he would start up, quaff a cup of wine as if to raise his spirits, andthen mingle in the conversation by some observation made abruptly or at random.“We drink this beaker,” said he, “to the health of Wilfred of Ivanhoe, champion of this Passage of Arms, and grieve that his woundrenders him absent from our board—Let all ﬁll to the pledge, and especially Cedric of Rotherwood, the worthy father of a son sopromising.”“No, my lord,” replied Cedric, standing up, and placing on the table his untasted cup, “I yield not the name of son to the disobedientyouth, who at once despises my commands, and relinquishes the manners and customs of his fathers.”“’Tis impossible,” cried Prince John, with well-feigned astonishment, “that so gallant a knight should be an unworthy or disobedientson!”“Yet, my lord,” answered Cedric, “so it is with this Wilfred. He left my homely dwelling to mingle with the gay nobility of yourbrother’s court, where he learned to do those tricks of horsemanship which you prize so highly. He left it contrary to my wish andcommand; and in the days of Alfred that would have been termed disobedience—ay, and a crime severely punishable.”“Alas!” replied Prince John, with a deep sigh of affected sympathy, “since your son was a follower of my unhappy brother, it neednot be enquired where or from whom he learned the lesson of ﬁlial disobedience.”Thus spake Prince John, wilfully forgetting, that of all the sons of Henry the Second, though no one was free from the charge, hehimself had been most distinguished for rebellion and ingratitude to his father.“I think,” said he, after a moment’s pause, “that my brother proposed to confer upon his favourite the rich manor of Ivanhoe.”“He did endow him with it,” answered Cedric; “nor is it my least quarrel with my son, that he stooped to hold, as a feudal vassal,the very domains which his fathers possessed in free and independent right.”“We shall then have your willing sanction, good Cedric,” said Prince John, “to confer this ﬁef upon a person whose dignity will notbe diminished by holding land of the British crown.—Sir Reginald Front-de-Bœuf,” he said, turning towards that Baron, “I trust youwill so keep the goodly Barony of Ivanhoe, that Sir Wilfred shall not incur his father’s farther displeasure by again entering upon thatﬁef.”“By St Anthony!” answered the black-brow’d giant, “I will consent that your highness shall hold me a Saxon, if either Cedric orWilfred, or the best that ever bore English blood, shall wrench from me the gift with which your highness has graced me.”“Whoever shall call thee Saxon, Sir Baron,” replied Cedric, offended at a mode of expression by which the Normans frequentlyexpressed their habitual contempt of the English, “will do thee an honour as great as it is undeserved.”Front-de-Bœuf would have replied, but Prince John’s petulance and levity got the start.“Assuredly,” said be, “my lords, the noble Cedric speaks truth; and his race may claim precedence over us as much in the length oftheir pedigrees as in the longitude of their cloaks.”“They go before us indeed in the ﬁeld—as deer before dogs,” said Malvoisin.“And with good right may they go before us—forget not,” said the Prior Aymer, “the superior decency and decorum of theirmanners.”“Their singular abstemiousness and temperance,” said De Bracy, forgetting the plan which promised him a Saxon bride.“Together with the courage and conduct,” said Brian de Bois-Guilbert, “by which they distinguished themselves at Hastings andelsewhere.”While, with smooth and smiling cheek, the courtiers, each in turn, followed their Prince’s example, and aimed a shaft of ridicule atCedric, the face of the Saxon became inﬂamed with passion, and he glanced his eyes ﬁercely from one to another, as if the quicksuccession of so many injuries had prevented his replying to them in turn; or, like a baited bull, who, surrounded by his tormentors, isat a loss to choose from among them the immediate object of his revenge. At length he spoke, in a voice half choked with passion;and, addressing himself to Prince John as the head and front of the offence which he had received, “Whatever,” he said, “have beenthe follies and vices of our race, a Saxon would have been held ‘nidering’,” 21 (the most emphatic term for abject worthlessness,)“who should in his own hall, and while his own wine-cup passed, have treated, or suffered to be treated, an unoffending guest as yourhighness has this day beheld me used; and whatever was the misfortune of our fathers on the ﬁeld of Hastings, those may at least besilent,” here he looked at Front-de-Bœuf and the Templar, “who have within these few hours once and again lost saddle and stirrupbefore the lance of a Saxon.”“By my faith, a biting jest!” said Prince John. “How like you it, sirs?—Our Saxon subjects rise in spirit and courage; becomeshrewd in wit, and bold in bearing, in these unsettled times—What say ye, my lords?—By this good light, I hold it best to take ourgalleys, and return to Normandy in time.”“For fear of the Saxons?” said De Bracy, laughing; “we should need no weapon but our hunting spears to bring these boars to bay.”“A truce with your raillery, Sir Knights,” said Fitzurse;—“and it were well,” he added, addressing the Prince, “that your highnessshould assure the worthy Cedric there is no insult intended him by jests, which must sound but harshly in the ear of a stranger.”“Insult?” answered Prince John, resuming his courtesy of demeanour; “I trust it will not be thought that I could mean, or permit any,to be offered in my presence. Here! I ﬁll my cup to Cedric himself, since he refuses to pledge his son’s health.”The cup went round amid the well-dissembled applause of the courtiers, which, however, failed to make the impression on the mindof the Saxon that had been designed. He was not naturally acute of perception, but those too much undervalued his understanding whodeemed that this ﬂattering compliment would obliterate the sense of the prior insult. He was silent, however, when the royal pledgeagain passed round, “To Sir Athelstane of Coningsburgh.”The knight made his obeisance, and showed his sense of the honour by draining a huge goblet in answer to it.“And now, sirs,” said Prince John, who began to be warmed with the wine which he had drank, “having done justice to our Saxonguests, we will pray of them some requital to our courtesy.—Worthy Thane,” he continued, addressing Cedric, “may we pray you toname to us some Norman whose mention may least sully your mouth, and to wash down with a goblet of wine all bitterness which thesound may leave behind it?”Fitzurse arose while Prince John spoke, and gliding behind the seat of the Saxon, whispered to him not to omit the opportunity ofputting an end to unkindness betwixt the two races, by naming Prince John. The Saxon replied not to this politic insinuation, but,rising up, and ﬁlling his cup to the brim, he addressed Prince John in these words: “Your highness has required that I should name aNorman deserving to be remembered at our banquet. This, perchance, is a hard task, since it calls on the slave to sing the praises of themaster—upon the vanquished, while pressed by all the evils of conquest, to sing the praises of the conqueror. Yet I will name aNorman—the ﬁrst in arms and in place—the best and the noblest of his race. And the lips that shall refuse to pledge me to his well-earned fame, I term false and dishonoured, and will so maintain them with my life.—I quaff this goblet to the health of Richard theLion-hearted!”Prince John, who had expected that his own name would have closed the Saxon’s speech, started when that of his injured brotherwas so unexpectedly introduced. He raised mechanically the wine-cup to his lips, then instantly set it down, to view the demeanour ofthe company at this unexpected proposal, which many of them felt it as unsafe to oppose as to comply with. Some of them, ancientand experienced courtiers, closely imitated the example of the Prince himself, raising the goblet to their lips, and again replacing itbefore them. There were many who, with a more generous feeling, exclaimed, “Long live King Richard! and may he be speedilyrestored to us!” And some few, among whom were Front-de-Bœuf and the Templar, in sullen disdain suffered their goblets to standuntasted before them. But no man ventured directly to gainsay a pledge ﬁlled to the health of the reigning monarch.Having enjoyed his triumph for about a minute, Cedric said to his companion, “Up, noble Athelstane! we have remained here longenough, since we have requited the hospitable courtesy of Prince John’s banquet. Those who wish to know further of our rude Saxonmanners must henceforth seek us in the homes of our fathers, since we have seen enough of royal banquets, and enough of Normancourtesy.”So saying, he arose and left the banqueting room, followed by Athelstane, and by several other guests, who, partaking of the Saxonlineage, held themselves insulted by the sarcasms of Prince John and his courtiers.“By the bones of St Thomas,” said Prince John, as they retreated, “the Saxon churls have borne off the best of the day, and haveretreated with triumph!”“‘Conclamatum est, poculatum est’,” said Prior Aymer; “we have drunk and we have shouted,—it were time we left our wineﬂagons.”“The monk hath some fair penitent to shrive to-night, that he is in such a hurry to depart,” said De Bracy.“Not so, Sir Knight,” replied the Abbot; “but I must move several miles forward this evening upon my homeward journey.”“They are breaking up,” said the Prince in a whisper to Fitzurse; “their fears anticipate the event, and this coward Prior is the ﬁrst toshrink from me.”“Fear not, my lord,” said Waldemar; “I will show him such reasons as shall induce him to join us when we hold our meeting atYork.—Sir Prior,” he said, “I must speak with you in private, before you mount your palfrey.”The other guests were now fast dispersing, with the exception of those immediately attached to Prince John’s faction, and hisretinue.“This, then, is the result of your advice,” said the Prince, turning an angry countenance upon Fitzurse; “that I should be bearded atmy own board by a drunken Saxon churl, and that, on the mere sound of my brother’s name, men should fall off from me as if I hadthe leprosy?”“Have patience, sir,” replied his counsellor; “I might retort your accusation, and blame the inconsiderate levity which foiled mydesign, and misled your own better judgment. But this is no time for recrimination. De Bracy and I will instantly go among theseshufﬂing cowards, and convince them they have gone too far to recede.”“It will be in vain,” said Prince John, pacing the apartment with disordered steps, and expressing himself with an agitation to whichthe wine he had drank partly contributed—“It will be in vain—they have seen the handwriting on the wall—they have marked the pawof the lion in the sand—they have heard his approaching roar shake the wood—nothing will reanimate their courage.”“Would to God,” said Fitzurse to De Bracy, “that aught could reanimate his own! His brother’s very name is an ague to him.Unhappy are the counsellors of a Prince, who wants fortitude and perseverance alike in good and in evil!”CHAPTER XVAnd yet he thinks,—ha, ha, ha, ha,—he thinksI am the tool and servant of his will.Well, let it be; through all the maze of troubleHis plots and base oppression must create,I’ll shape myself a way to higher things,And who will say ’tis wrong?BASIL, A TRAGEDYNo spider ever took more pains to repair the shattered meshes of his web, than did Waldemar Fitzurse to reunite and combine thescattered members of Prince John’s cabal. Few of these were attached to him from inclination, and none from personal regard. It wastherefore necessary, that Fitzurse should open to them new prospects of advantage, and remind them of those which they at presentenjoyed. To the young and wild nobles, he held out the prospect of unpunished license and uncontrolled revelry; to the ambitious, thatof power, and to the covetous, that of increased wealth and extended domains. The leaders of the mercenaries received a donation ingold; an argument the most persuasive to their minds, and without which all others would have proved in vain. Promises were stillmore liberally distributed than money by this active agent; and, in ﬁne, nothing was left undone that could determine the wavering, oranimate the disheartened. The return of King Richard he spoke of as an event altogether beyond the reach of probability; yet, when heobserved, from the doubtful looks and uncertain answers which he received, that this was the apprehension by which the minds of hisaccomplices were most haunted, he boldly treated that event, should it really take place, as one which ought not to alter their politicalcalculations.“If Richard returns,” said Fitzurse, “he returns to enrich his needy and impoverished crusaders at the expense of those who did notfollow him to the Holy Land. He returns to call to a fearful reckoning, those who, during his absence, have done aught that can beconstrued offence or encroachment upon either the laws of the land or the privileges of the crown. He returns to avenge upon theOrders of the Temple and the Hospital, the preference which they showed to Philip of France during the wars in the Holy Land. Hereturns, in ﬁne, to punish as a rebel every adherent of his brother Prince John. Are ye afraid of his power?” continued the artfulconﬁdent of that Prince, “we acknowledge him a strong and valiant knight; but these are not the days of King Arthur, when achampion could encounter an army. If Richard indeed comes back, it must be alone,—unfollowed—unfriended. The bones of hisgallant army have whitened the sands of Palestine. The few of his followers who have returned have straggled hither like this Wilfredof Ivanhoe, beggared and broken men.—And what talk ye of Richard’s right of birth?” he proceeded, in answer to those who objectedscruples on that head. “Is Richard’s title of primogeniture more decidedly certain than that of Duke Robert of Normandy, theConqueror’s eldest son? And yet William the Red, and Henry, his second and third brothers, were successively preferred to him by thevoice of the nation, Robert had every merit which can be pleaded for Richard; he was a bold knight, a good leader, generous to hisfriends and to the church, and, to crown the whole, a crusader and a conqueror of the Holy Sepulchre; and yet he died a blind andmiserable prisoner in the Castle of Cardiff, because he opposed himself to the will of the people, who chose that he should not ruleover them. It is our right,” he said, “to choose from the blood royal the prince who is best qualiﬁed to hold the supreme power—thatis,” said he, correcting himself, “him whose election will best promote the interests of the nobility. In personal qualiﬁcations,” headded, “it was possible that Prince John might be inferior to his brother Richard; but when it was considered that the latter returnedwith the sword of vengeance in his hand, while the former held out rewards, immunities, privileges, wealth, and honours, it could notbe doubted which was the king whom in wisdom the nobility were called on to support.”These, and many more arguments, some adapted to the peculiar circumstances of those whom he addressed, had the expectedweight with the nobles of Prince John’s faction. Most of them consented to attend the proposed meeting at York, for the purpose ofmaking general arrangements for placing the crown upon the head of Prince John.It was late at night, when, worn out and exhausted with his various exertions, however gratiﬁed with the result, Fitzurse, returningto the Castle of Ashby, met with De Bracy, who had exchanged his banqueting garments for a short green kirtle, with hose of the samecloth and colour, a leathern cap or head-piece, a short sword, a horn slung over his shoulder, a long bow in his hand, and a bundle ofarrows stuck in his belt. Had Fitzurse met this ﬁgure in an outer apartment, he would have passed him without notice, as one of theyeomen of the guard; but ﬁnding him in the inner hall, he looked at him with more attention, and recognised the Norman knight in thedress of an English yeoman.“What mummery is this, De Bracy?” said Fitzurse, somewhat angrily; “is this a time for Christmas gambols and quaint maskings,when the fate of our master, Prince John, is on the very verge of decision? Why hast thou not been, like me, among these heartlesscravens, whom the very name of King Richard terriﬁes, as it is said to do the children of the Saracens?”“I have been attending to mine own business,” answered De Bracy calmly, “as you, Fitzurse, have been minding yours.”“I minding mine own business!” echoed Waldemar; “I have been engaged in that of Prince John, our joint patron.”“As if thou hadst any other reason for that, Waldemar,” said De Bracy, “than the promotion of thine own individual interest? Come,Fitzurse, we know each other—ambition is thy pursuit, pleasure is mine, and they become our different ages. Of Prince John thouthinkest as I do; that he is too weak to be a determined monarch, too tyrannical to be an easy monarch, too insolent and presumptuousto be a popular monarch, and too ﬁckle and timid to be long a monarch of any kind. But he is a monarch by whom Fitzurse and DeBracy hope to rise and thrive; and therefore you aid him with your policy, and I with the lances of my Free Companions.”“A hopeful auxiliary,” said Fitzurse impatiently; “playing the fool in the very moment of utter necessity.—What on earth dost thoupurpose by this absurd disguise at a moment so urgent?”“To get me a wife,” answered De Bracy coolly, “after the manner of the tribe of Benjamin.”“The tribe of Benjamin?” said Fitzurse; “I comprehend thee not.”“Wert thou not in presence yester-even,” said De Bracy, “when we heard the Prior Aymer tell us a tale in reply to the romancewhich was sung by the Minstrel?—He told how, long since in Palestine, a deadly feud arose between the tribe of Benjamin and therest of the Israelitish nation; and how they cut to pieces well-nigh all the chivalry of that tribe; and how they swore by our blessedLady, that they would not permit those who remained to marry in their lineage; and how they became grieved for their vow, and sentto consult his holiness the Pope how they might be absolved from it; and how, by the advice of the Holy Father, the youth of the tribeof Benjamin carried off from a superb tournament all the ladies who were there present, and thus won them wives without the consenteither of their brides or their brides’ families.”“I have heard the story,” said Fitzurse, “though either the Prior or thou has made some singular alterations in date andcircumstances.”“I tell thee,” said De Bracy, “that I mean to purvey me a wife after the fashion of the tribe of Benjamin; which is as much as to say,that in this same equipment I will fall upon that herd of Saxon bullocks, who have this night left the castle, and carry off from them thelovely Rowena.”“Art thou mad, De Bracy?” said Fitzurse. “Bethink thee that, though the men be Saxons, they are rich and powerful, and regardedwith the more respect by their countrymen, that wealth and honour are but the lot of few of Saxon descent.”“And should belong to none,” said De Bracy; “the work of the Conquest should be completed.”“This is no time for it at least,” said Fitzurse “the approaching crisis renders the favour of the multitude indispensable, and PrinceJohn cannot refuse justice to any one who injures their favourites.”“Let him grant it, if he dare,” said De Bracy; “he will soon see the difference betwixt the support of such a lusty lot of spears asmine, and that of a heartless mob of Saxon churls. Yet I mean no immediate discovery of myself. Seem I not in this garb as bold aforester as ever blew horn? The blame of the violence shall rest with the outlaws of the Yorkshire forests. I have sure spies on theSaxon’s motions—To-night they sleep in the convent of Saint Wittol, or Withold, or whatever they call that churl of a Saxon Saint atBurton-on-Trent. Next day’s march brings them within our reach, and, falcon-ways, we swoop on them at once. Presently after I willappear in mine own shape, play the courteous knight, rescue the unfortunate and afﬂicted fair one from the hands of the rude ravishers,conduct her to Front-de-Bœuf’s Castle, or to Normandy, if it should be necessary, and produce her not again to her kindred until she bethe bride and dame of Maurice de Bracy.”“A marvellously sage plan,” said Fitzurse, “and, as I think, not entirely of thine own device.—Come, be frank, De Bracy, who aidedthee in the invention? and who is to assist in the execution? for, as I think, thine own band lies as far off as York.”“Marry, if thou must needs know,” said De Bracy, “it was the Templar Brian de Bois-Guilbert that shaped out the enterprise, whichthe adventure of the men of Benjamin suggested to me. He is to aid me in the onslaught, and he and his followers will personate theoutlaws, from whom my valorous arm is, after changing my garb, to rescue the lady.”“By my halidome,” said Fitzurse, “the plan was worthy of your united wisdom! and thy prudence, De Bracy, is most especiallymanifested in the project of leaving the lady in the hands of thy worthy confederate. Thou mayst, I think, succeed in taking her fromher Saxon friends, but how thou wilt rescue her afterwards from the clutches of Bois-Guilbert seems considerably more doubtful—Heis a falcon well accustomed to pounce on a partridge, and to hold his prey fast.”“He is a Templar,” said De Bracy, “and cannot therefore rival me in my plan of wedding this heiress;—and to attempt aughtdishonourable against the intended bride of De Bracy—By Heaven! were he a whole Chapter of his Order in his single person, hedared not do me such an injury!”“Then since nought that I can say,” said Fitzurse, “will put this folly from thy imagination, (for well I know the obstinacy of thydisposition,) at least waste as little time as possible—let not thy folly be lasting as well as untimely.”“I tell thee,” answered De Bracy, “that it will be the work of a few hours, and I shall be at York—at the head of my daring andvalorous fellows, as ready to support any bold design as thy policy can be to form one.—But I hear my comrades assembling, and thesteeds stamping and neighing in the outer court.—Farewell.—I go, like a true knight, to win the smiles of beauty.”“Like a true knight?” repeated Fitzurse, looking after him; “like a fool, I should say, or like a child, who will leave the most seriousand needful occupation, to chase the down of the thistle that drives past him.—But it is with such tools that I must work;—and forwhose advantage?—For that of a Prince as unwise as he is proﬂigate, and as likely to be an ungrateful master as he has already proveda rebellious son and an unnatural brother.—But he—he, too, is but one of the tools with which I labour; and, proud as he is, should hepresume to separate his interest from mine, this is a secret which he shall soon learn.”The meditations of the statesman were here interrupted by the voice of the Prince from an interior apartment, calling out, “NobleWaldemar Fitzurse!” and, with bonnet doffed, the future Chancellor (for to such high preferment did the wily Norman aspire) hastenedto receive the orders of the future sovereign.CHAPTER XVIFar in a wild, unknown to public view,From youth to age a reverend hermit grew;The moss his bed, the cave his humble cell,His food the fruits, his drink the crystal wellRemote from man, with God he pass’d his days,Prayer all his business—all his pleasure praise.PARNELLThe reader cannot have forgotten that the event of the tournament was decided by the exertions of an unknown knight, whom, onaccount of the passive and indifferent conduct which he had manifested on the former part of the day, the spectators had entitled, “LeNoir Faineant”. This knight had left the ﬁeld abruptly when the victory was achieved; and when he was called upon to receive thereward of his valour, he was nowhere to be found. In the meantime, while summoned by heralds and by trumpets, the knight washolding his course northward, avoiding all frequented paths, and taking the shortest road through the woodlands. He paused for thenight at a small hostelry lying out of the ordinary route, where, however, he obtained from a wandering minstrel news of the event ofthe tourney.On the next morning the knight departed early, with the intention of making a long journey; the condition of his horse, which he hadcarefully spared during the preceding morning, being such as enabled him to travel far without the necessity of much repose. Yet hispurpose was bafﬂed by the devious paths through which he rode, so that when evening closed upon him, he only found himself on thefrontiers of the West Riding of Yorkshire. By this time both horse and man required refreshment, and it became necessary, moreover,to look out for some place in which they might spend the night, which was now fast approaching.The place where the traveller found himself seemed unpropitious for obtaining either shelter or refreshment, and he was likely to bereduced to the usual expedient of knights-errant, who, on such occasions, turned their horses to graze, and laid themselves down tomeditate on their lady-mistress, with an oak-tree for a canopy. But the Black Knight either had no mistress to meditate upon, or, beingas indifferent in love as he seemed to be in war, was not sufﬁciently occupied by passionate reﬂections upon her beauty and cruelty, tobe able to parry the effects of fatigue and hunger, and suffer love to act as a substitute for the solid comforts of a bed and supper. Hefelt dissatisﬁed, therefore, when, looking around, he found himself deeply involved in woods, through which indeed there were manyopen glades, and some paths, but such as seemed only formed by the numerous herds of cattle which grazed in the forest, or by theanimals of chase, and the hunters who made prey of them.The sun, by which the knight had chieﬂy directed his course, had now sunk behind the Derbyshire hills on his left, and every effortwhich he might make to pursue his journey was as likely to lead him out of his road as to advance him on his route. After having invain endeavoured to select the most beaten path, in hopes it might lead to the cottage of some herdsman, or the silvan lodge of aforester, and having repeatedly found himself totally unable to determine on a choice, the knight resolved to trust to the sagacity of hishorse; experience having, on former occasions, made him acquainted with the wonderful talent possessed by these animals forextricating themselves and their riders on such emergencies.The good steed, grievously fatigued with so long a day’s journey under a rider cased in mail, had no sooner found, by the slackenedreins, that he was abandoned to his own guidance, than he seemed to assume new strength and spirit; and whereas, formerly he hadscarce replied to the spur, otherwise than by a groan, he now, as if proud of the conﬁdence reposed in him, pricked up his ears, andassumed, of his own accord, a more lively motion. The path which the animal adopted rather turned off from the course pursued by theknight during the day; but as the horse seemed conﬁdent in his choice, the rider abandoned himself to his discretion.He was justiﬁed by the event; for the footpath soon after appeared a little wider and more worn, and the tinkle of a small bell gavethe knight to understand that he was in the vicinity of some chapel or hermitage.Accordingly, he soon reached an open plat of turf, on the opposite side of which, a rock, rising abruptly from a gently sloping plain,offered its grey and weatherbeaten front to the traveller. Ivy mantled its sides in some places, and in others oaks and holly bushes,whose roots found nourishment in the cliffs of the crag, waved over the precipices below, like the plumage of the warrior over his steelhelmet, giving grace to that whose chief expression was terror. At the bottom of the rock, and leaning, as it were, against it, wasconstructed a rude hut, built chieﬂy of the trunks of trees felled in the neighbouring forest, and secured against the weather by havingits crevices stuffed with moss mingled with clay. The stem of a young ﬁr-tree lopped of its branches, with a piece of wood tied acrossnear the top, was planted upright by the door, as a rude emblem of the holy cross. At a little distance on the right hand, a fountain ofthe purest water trickled out of the rock, and was received in a hollow stone, which labour had formed into a rustic basin. Escapingfrom thence, the stream murmured down the descent by a channel which its course had long worn, and so wandered through the littleplain to lose itself in the neighbouring wood.Beside this fountain were the ruins of a very small chapel, of which the roof had partly fallen in. The building, when entire, hadnever been above sixteen feet long by twelve feet in breadth, and the roof, low in proportion, rested upon four concentric arches whichsprung from the four corners of the building, each supported upon a short and heavy pillar. The ribs of two of these arches remained,though the roof had fallen down betwixt them; over the others it remained entire. The entrance to this ancient place of devotion wasunder a very low round arch, ornamented by several courses of that zig-zag moulding, resembling shark’s teeth, which appears sooften in the more ancient Saxon architecture. A belfry rose above the porch on four small pillars, within which hung the green andweatherbeaten bell, the feeble sounds of which had been some time before heard by the Black Knight.The whole peaceful and quiet scene lay glimmering in twilight before the eyes of the traveller, giving him good assurance oflodging for the night; since it was a special duty of those hermits who dwelt in the woods, to exercise hospitality towards benighted orbewildered passengers.Accordingly, the knight took no time to consider minutely the particulars which we have detailed, but thanking Saint Julian (thepatron of travellers) who had sent him good harbourage, he leaped from his horse and assailed the door of the hermitage with the buttof his lance, in order to arouse attention and gain admittance.It was some time before he obtained any answer, and the reply, when made, was unpropitious.“Pass on, whosoever thou art,” was the answer given by a deep hoarse voice from within the hut, “and disturb not the servant ofGod and St Dunstan in his evening devotions.”“Worthy father,” answered the knight, “here is a poor wanderer bewildered in these woods, who gives thee the opportunity ofexercising thy charity and hospitality.”“Good brother,” replied the inhabitant of the hermitage, “it has pleased Our Lady and St Dunstan to destine me for the object ofthose virtues, instead of the exercise thereof. I have no provisions here which even a dog would share with me, and a horse of anytenderness of nurture would despise my couch—pass therefore on thy way, and God speed thee.”“But how,” replied the knight, “is it possible for me to ﬁnd my way through such a wood as this, when darkness is coming on? Ipray you, reverend father as you are a Christian, to undo your door, and at least point out to me my road.”“And I pray you, good Christian brother,” replied the anchorite, “to disturb me no more. You have already interrupted one ‘pater’,two ‘aves’, and a ‘credo’, which I, miserable sinner that I am, should, according to my vow, have said before moonrise.”“The road—the road!” vociferated the knight, “give me directions for the road, if I am to expect no more from thee.”“The road,” replied the hermit, “is easy to hit. The path from the wood leads to a morass, and from thence to a ford, which, as therains have abated, may now be passable. When thou hast crossed the ford, thou wilt take care of thy footing up the left bank, as it issomewhat precipitous; and the path, which hangs over the river, has lately, as I learn, (for I seldom leave the duties of my chapel,)given way in sundry places. Thou wilt then keep straight forward—-”“A broken path—a precipice—a ford, and a morass!” said the knight interrupting him,—“Sir Hermit, if you were the holiest thatever wore beard or told bead, you shall scarce prevail on me to hold this road to-night. I tell thee, that thou, who livest by the charityof the country—ill deserved, as I doubt it is—hast no right to refuse shelter to the wayfarer when in distress. Either open the doorquickly, or, by the rood, I will beat it down and make entry for myself.”“Friend wayfarer,” replied the hermit, “be not importunate; if thou puttest me to use the carnal weapon in mine own defence, it willbe e’en the worse for you.”At this moment a distant noise of barking and growling, which the traveller had for some time heard, became extremely loud andfurious, and made the knight suppose that the hermit, alarmed by his threat of making forcible entry, had called the dogs who madethis clamour to aid him in his defence, out of some inner recess in which they had been kennelled. Incensed at this preparation on thehermit’s part for making good his inhospitable purpose, the knight struck the door so furiously with his foot, that posts as well asstaples shook with violence.The anchorite, not caring again to expose his door to a similar shock, now called out aloud, “Patience, patience—spare thy strength,good traveller, and I will presently undo the door, though, it may be, my doing so will be little to thy pleasure.”The door accordingly was opened; and the hermit, a large, strong-built man, in his sackcloth gown and hood, girt with a rope ofrushes, stood before the knight. He had in one hand a lighted torch, or link, and in the other a baton of crab-tree, so thick and heavy,that it might well be termed a club. Two large shaggy dogs, half greyhound half mastiff, stood ready to rush upon the traveller as soonas the door should be opened. But when the torch glanced upon the lofty crest and golden spurs of the knight, who stood without, thehermit, altering probably his original intentions, repressed the rage of his auxiliaries, and, changing his tone to a sort of churlishcourtesy, invited the knight to enter his hut, making excuse for his unwillingness to open his lodge after sunset, by alleging themultitude of robbers and outlaws who were abroad, and who gave no honour to Our Lady or St Dunstan, nor to those holy men whospent life in their service.“The poverty of your cell, good father,” said the knight, looking around him, and seeing nothing but a bed of leaves, a cruciﬁxrudely carved in oak, a missal, with a rough-hewn table and two stools, and one or two clumsy articles of furniture—“the poverty ofyour cell should seem a sufﬁcient defence against any risk of thieves, not to mention the aid of two trusty dogs, large and strongenough, I think, to pull down a stag, and of course, to match with most men.”“The good keeper of the forest,” said the hermit, “hath allowed me the use of these animals, to protect my solitude until the timesshall mend.”Having said this, he ﬁxed his torch in a twisted branch of iron which served for a candlestick; and, placing the oaken trivet beforethe embers of the ﬁre, which he refreshed with some dry wood, he placed a stool upon one side of the table, and beckoned to theknight to do the same upon the other.They sat down, and gazed with great gravity at each other, each thinking in his heart that he had seldom seen a stronger or moreathletic ﬁgure than was placed opposite to him.“Reverend hermit,” said the knight, after looking long and ﬁxedly at his host, “were it not to interrupt your devout meditations, Iwould pray to know three things of your holiness; ﬁrst, where I am to put my horse?—secondly, what I can have for supper?—thirdly,where I am to take up my couch for the night?”“I will reply to you,” said the hermit, “with my ﬁnger, it being against my rule to speak by words where signs can answer thepurpose.” So saying, he pointed successively to two corners of the hut. “Your stable,” said he, “is there—your bed there; and,”reaching down a platter with two handfuls of parched pease upon it from the neighbouring shelf, and placing it upon the table, headded, “your supper is here.”The knight shrugged his shoulders, and leaving the hut, brought in his horse, (which in the interim he had fastened to a tree,)unsaddled him with much attention, and spread upon the steed’s weary back his own mantle.The hermit was apparently somewhat moved to compassion by the anxiety as well as address which the stranger displayed intending his horse; for, muttering something about provender left for the keeper’s palfrey, he dragged out of a recess a bundle of forage,which he spread before the knight’s charger, and immediately afterwards shook down a quantity of dried fern in the corner which hehad assigned for the rider’s couch. The knight returned him thanks for his courtesy; and, this duty done, both resumed their seats bythe table, whereon stood the trencher of pease placed between them. The hermit, after a long grace, which had once been Latin, but ofwhich original language few traces remained, excepting here and there the long rolling termination of some word or phrase, setexample to his guest, by modestly putting into a very large mouth, furnished with teeth which might have ranked with those of a boarboth in sharpness and whiteness, some three or four dried pease, a miserable grist as it seemed for so large and able a mill.The knight, in order to follow so laudable an example, laid aside his helmet, his corslet, and the greater part of his armour, andshowed to the hermit a head thick-curled with yellow hair, high features, blue eyes, remarkably bright and sparkling, a mouth wellformed, having an upper lip clothed with mustachoes darker than his hair, and bearing altogether the look of a bold, daring, andenterprising man, with which his strong form well corresponded.The hermit, as if wishing to answer to the conﬁdence of his guest, threw back his cowl, and showed a round bullet head belongingto a man in the prime of life. His close-shaven crown, surrounded by a circle of stiff curled black hair, had something the appearanceof a parish pinfold begirt by its high hedge. The features expressed nothing of monastic austerity, or of ascetic privations; on thecontrary, it was a bold bluff countenance, with broad black eyebrows, a well-turned forehead, and cheeks as round and vermilion asthose of a trumpeter, from which descended a long and curly black beard. Such a visage, joined to the brawny form of the holy man,spoke rather of sirloins and haunches, than of pease and pulse. This incongruity did not escape the guest. After he had with greatdifﬁculty accomplished the mastication of a mouthful of the dried pease, he found it absolutely necessary to request his piousentertainer to furnish him with some liquor; who replied to his request by placing before him a large can of the purest water from thefountain.“It is from the well of St Dunstan,” said he, “in which, betwixt sun and sun, he baptized ﬁve hundred heathen Danes and Britons—blessed be his name!” And applying his black beard to the pitcher, he took a draught much more moderate in quantity than hisencomium seemed to warrant.“It seems to me, reverend father,” said the knight, “that the small morsels which you eat, together with this holy, but somewhat thinbeverage, have thriven with you marvellously. You appear a man more ﬁt to win the ram at a wrestling match, or the ring at a bout atquarter-staff, or the bucklers at a sword-play, than to linger out your time in this desolate wilderness, saying masses, and living uponparched pease and cold water.”“Sir Knight,” answered the hermit, “your thoughts, like those of the ignorant laity, are according to the ﬂesh. It has pleased OurLady and my patron saint to bless the pittance to which I restrain myself, even as the pulse and water was blessed to the childrenShadrach, Meshech, and Abednego, who drank the same rather than deﬁle themselves with the wine and meats which were appointedthem by the King of the Saracens.”“Holy father,” said the knight, “upon whose countenance it hath pleased Heaven to work such a miracle, permit a sinful layman tocrave thy name?”“Thou mayst call me,” answered the hermit, “the Clerk of Copmanhurst, for so I am termed in these parts—They add, it is true, theepithet holy, but I stand not upon that, as being unworthy of such addition.—And now, valiant knight, may I pray ye for the name ofmy honourable guest?”“Truly,” said the knight, “Holy Clerk of Copmanhurst, men call me in these parts the Black Knight,—many, sir, add to it the epithetof Sluggard, whereby I am no way ambitious to be distinguished.”The hermit could scarcely forbear from smiling at his guest’s reply.“I see,” said he, “Sir Sluggish Knight, that thou art a man of prudence and of counsel; and moreover, I see that my poor monasticfare likes thee not, accustomed, perhaps, as thou hast been, to the license of courts and of camps, and the luxuries of cities; and now Ibethink me, Sir Sluggard, that when the charitable keeper of this forest-walk left those dogs for my protection, and also those bundlesof forage, he left me also some food, which, being unﬁt for my use, the very recollection of it had escaped me amid my more weightymeditations.”“I dare be sworn he did so,” said the knight; “I was convinced that there was better food in the cell, Holy Clerk, since you ﬁrstdoffed your cowl.—Your keeper is ever a jovial fellow; and none who beheld thy grinders contending with these pease, and thy throatﬂooded with this ungenial element, could see thee doomed to such horse-provender and horse-beverage,” (pointing to the provisionsupon the table,) “and refrain from mending thy cheer. Let us see the keeper’s bounty, therefore, without delay.”The hermit cast a wistful look upon the knight, in which there was a sort of comic expression of hesitation, as if uncertain how farhe should act prudently in trusting his guest. There was, however, as much of bold frankness in the knight’s countenance as waspossible to be expressed by features. His smile, too, had something in it irresistibly comic, and gave an assurance of faith and loyalty,with which his host could not refrain from sympathizing.After exchanging a mute glance or two, the hermit went to the further side of the hut, and opened a hutch, which was concealedwith great care and some ingenuity. Out of the recesses of a dark closet, into which this aperture gave admittance, he brought a largepasty, baked in a pewter platter of unusual dimensions. This mighty dish he placed before his guest, who, using his poniard to cut itopen, lost no time in making himself acquainted with its contents.“How long is it since the good keeper has been here?” said the knight to his host, after having swallowed several hasty morsels ofthis reinforcement to the hermit’s good cheer.“About two months,” answered the father hastily.“By the true Lord,” answered the knight, “every thing in your hermitage is miraculous, Holy Clerk! for I would have been swornthat the fat buck which furnished this venison had been running on foot within the week.”The hermit was somewhat discountenanced by this observation; and, moreover, he made but a poor ﬁgure while gazing on thediminution of the pasty, on which his guest was making desperate inroads; a warfare in which his previous profession of abstinenceleft him no pretext for joining.“I have been in Palestine, Sir Clerk,” said the knight, stopping short of a sudden, “and I bethink me it is a custom there that everyhost who entertains a guest shall assure him of the wholesomeness of his food, by partaking of it along with him. Far be it from me tosuspect so holy a man of aught inhospitable; nevertheless I will be highly bound to you would you comply with this Eastern custom.”“To ease your unnecessary scruples, Sir Knight, I will for once depart from my rule,” replied the hermit. And as there were no forksin those days, his clutches were instantly in the bowels of the pasty.The ice of ceremony being once broken, it seemed matter of rivalry between the guest and the entertainer which should display thebest appetite; and although the former had probably fasted longest, yet the hermit fairly surpassed him.“Holy Clerk,” said the knight, when his hunger was appeased, “I would gage my good horse yonder against a zecchin, that thatsame honest keeper to whom we are obliged for the venison has left thee a stoup of wine, or a runlet of canary, or some such triﬂe, byway of ally to this noble pasty. This would be a circumstance, doubtless, totally unworthy to dwell in the memory of so rigid ananchorite; yet, I think, were you to search yonder crypt once more, you would ﬁnd that I am right in my conjecture.”The hermit only replied by a grin; and returning to the hutch, he produced a leathern bottle, which might contain about four quarts.He also brought forth two large drinking cups, made out of the horn of the urus, and hooped with silver. Having made this goodlyprovision for washing down the supper, he seemed to think no farther ceremonious scruple necessary on his part; but ﬁlling both cups,and saying, in the Saxon fashion, “‘Waes hael’, Sir Sluggish Knight!” he emptied his own at a draught.“‘Drink hael’, Holy Clerk of Copmanhurst!” answered the warrior, and did his host reason in a similar brimmer.“Holy Clerk,” said the stranger, after the ﬁrst cup was thus swallowed, “I cannot but marvel that a man possessed of such thews andsinews as thine, and who therewithal shows the talent of so goodly a trencher-man, should think of abiding by himself in thiswilderness. In my judgment, you are ﬁtter to keep a castle or a fort, eating of the fat and drinking of the strong, than to live here uponpulse and water, or even upon the charity of the keeper. At least, were I as thou, I should ﬁnd myself both disport and plenty out of theking’s deer. There is many a goodly herd in these forests, and a buck will never be missed that goes to the use of Saint Dunstan’schaplain.”“Sir Sluggish Knight,” replied the Clerk, “these are dangerous words, and I pray you to forbear them. I am true hermit to the kingand law, and were I to spoil my liege’s game, I should be sure of the prison, and, an my gown saved me not, were in some peril ofhanging.”“Nevertheless, were I as thou,” said the knight, “I would take my walk by moonlight, when foresters and keepers were warm in bed,and ever and anon,—as I pattered my prayers,—I would let ﬂy a shaft among the herds of dun deer that feed in the glades—Resolveme, Holy Clerk, hast thou never practised such a pastime?”“Friend Sluggard,” answered the hermit, “thou hast seen all that can concern thee of my housekeeping, and something more than hedeserves who takes up his quarters by violence. Credit me, it is better to enjoy the good which God sends thee, than to beimpertinently curious how it comes. Fill thy cup, and welcome; and do not, I pray thee, by further impertinent enquiries, put me toshow that thou couldst hardly have made good thy lodging had I been earnest to oppose thee.”“By my faith,” said the knight, “thou makest me more curious than ever! Thou art the most mysterious hermit I ever met; and I willknow more of thee ere we part. As for thy threats, know, holy man, thou speakest to one whose trade it is to ﬁnd out danger whereverit is to be met with.”“Sir Sluggish Knight, I drink to thee,” said the hermit; “respecting thy valour much, but deeming wondrous slightly of thydiscretion. If thou wilt take equal arms with me, I will give thee, in all friendship and brotherly love, such sufﬁcing penance andcomplete absolution, that thou shalt not for the next twelve months sin the sin of excess of curiosity.”The knight pledged him, and desired him to name his weapons.“There is none,” replied the hermit, “from the scissors of Delilah, and the tenpenny nail of Jael, to the scimitar of Goliath, at which Iam not a match for thee—But, if I am to make the election, what sayst thou, good friend, to these trinkets?”Thus speaking, he opened another hutch, and took out from it a couple of broadswords and bucklers, such as were used by theyeomanry of the period. The knight, who watched his motions, observed that this second place of concealment was furnished with twoor three good long-bows, a cross-bow, a bundle of bolts for the latter, and half-a-dozen sheaves of arrows for the former. A harp, andother matters of a very uncanonical appearance, were also visible when this dark recess was opened.“I promise thee, brother Clerk,” said he, “I will ask thee no more offensive questions. The contents of that cupboard are an answerto all my enquiries; and I see a weapon there” (here he stooped and took out the harp) “on which I would more gladly prove my skillwith thee, than at the sword and buckler.”“I hope, Sir Knight,” said the hermit, “thou hast given no good reason for thy surname of the Sluggard. I do promise thee I suspectthee grievously. Nevertheless, thou art my guest, and I will not put thy manhood to the proof without thine own free will. Sit theedown, then, and ﬁll thy cup; let us drink, sing, and be merry. If thou knowest ever a good lay, thou shalt be welcome to a nook of pastyat Copmanhurst so long as I serve the chapel of St Dunstan, which, please God, shall be till I change my grey covering for one ofgreen turf. But come, ﬁll a ﬂagon, for it will crave some time to tune the harp; and nought pitches the voice and sharpens the ear like acup of wine. For my part, I love to feel the grape at my very ﬁnger-ends before they make the harp-strings tinkle.” 22CHAPTER XVIIAt eve, within yon studious nook,I ope my brass-embossed book,Portray’d with many a holy deedOf martyrs crown’d with heavenly meed;Then, as my taper waxes dim,Chant, ere I sleep, my measured hymn.Who but would cast his pomp away,To take my staff and amice grey,And to the world’s tumultuous stage,Prefer the peaceful Hermitage?WARTONNotwithstanding the prescription of the genial hermit, with which his guest willingly complied, he found it no easy matter to bringthe harp to harmony.“Methinks, holy father,” said he, “the instrument wants one string, and the rest have been somewhat misused.”“Ay, mark’st thou that?” replied the hermit; “that shows thee a master of the craft. Wine and wassail,” he added, gravely casting uphis eyes—“all the fault of wine and wassail!—I told Allan-a-Dale, the northern minstrel, that he would damage the harp if he touchedit after the seventh cup, but he would not be controlled—Friend, I drink to thy successful performance.”So saying, he took off his cup with much gravity, at the same time shaking his head at the intemperance of the Scottish harper.The knight in the meantime, had brought the strings into some order, and after a short prelude, asked his host whether he wouldchoose a “sirvente” in the language of “oc”, or a “lai” in the language of “oui”, or a “virelai”, or a ballad in the vulgar English. 23“A ballad, a ballad,” said the hermit, “against all the ‘ocs’ and ‘ouis’ of France. Downright English am I, Sir Knight, and downrightEnglish was my patron St Dunstan, and scorned ‘oc’ and ‘oui’, as he would have scorned the parings of the devil’s hoof—downrightEnglish alone shall be sung in this cell.”“I will assay, then,” said the knight, “a ballad composed by a Saxon glee-man, whom I knew in Holy Land.”It speedily appeared, that if the knight was not a complete master of the minstrel art, his taste for it had at least been cultivatedunder the best instructors. Art had taught him to soften the faults of a voice which had little compass, and was naturally rough ratherthan mellow, and, in short, had done all that culture can do in supplying natural deﬁciencies. His performance, therefore, might havebeen termed very respectable by abler judges than the hermit, especially as the knight threw into the notes now a degree of spirit, andnow of plaintive enthusiasm, which gave force and energy to the verses which he sung.THE CRUSADER’S RETURN.1.High deeds achieved of knightly fame,From Palestine the champion came;The cross upon his shoulders borne,Battle and blast had dimm’d and torn.Each dint upon his batter’d shieldWas token of a foughten ﬁeld;And thus, beneath his lady’s bower,He sung as fell the twilight hour:—2.“Joy to the fair!—thy knight behold,Return’d from yonder land of gold;No wealth he brings, nor wealth can need,Save his good arms and battle-steedHis spurs, to dash against a foe,His lance and sword to lay him low;Such all the trophies of his toil,Such—and the hope of Tekla’s smile!3.“Joy to the fair! whose constant knightHer favour ﬁred to feats of might;Unnoted shall she not remain,Where meet the bright and noble train;Minstrel shall sing and herald tell—‘Mark yonder maid of beauty well,’Tis she for whose bright eyes were wonThe listed ﬁeld at Askalon!4.“‘Note well her smile!—it edged the bladeWhich ﬁfty wives to widows made,When, vain his strength and Mahound’s spell,Iconium’s turban’d Soldan fell.Seest thou her locks, whose sunny glowHalf shows, half shades, her neck of snow?Twines not of them one golden thread,But for its sake a Paynim bled.’5.“Joy to the fair!—my name unknown,Each deed, and all its praise thine ownThen, oh! unbar this churlish gate,The night dew falls, the hour is late.Inured to Syria’s glowing breath,I feel the north breeze chill as death;Let grateful love quell maiden shame,And grant him bliss who brings thee fame.”During this performance, the hermit demeaned himself much like a ﬁrst-rate critic of the present day at a new opera. He reclinedback upon his seat, with his eyes half shut; now, folding his hands and twisting his thumbs, he seemed absorbed in attention, and anon,balancing his expanded palms, he gently ﬂourished them in time to the music. At one or two favourite cadences, he threw in a littleassistance of his own, where the knight’s voice seemed unable to carry the air so high as his worshipful taste approved. When the songwas ended, the anchorite emphatically declared it a good one, and well sung.“And yet,” said he, “I think my Saxon countrymen had herded long enough with the Normans, to fall into the tone of theirmelancholy ditties. What took the honest knight from home? or what could he expect but to ﬁnd his mistress agreeably engaged with arival on his return, and his serenade, as they call it, as little regarded as the caterwauling of a cat in the gutter? Nevertheless, SirKnight, I drink this cup to thee, to the success of all true lovers—I fear you are none,” he added, on observing that the knight (whosebrain began to be heated with these repeated draughts) qualiﬁed his ﬂagon from the water pitcher.“Why,” said the knight, “did you not tell me that this water was from the well of your blessed patron, St Dunstan?”“Ay, truly,” said the hermit, “and many a hundred of pagans did he baptize there, but I never heard that he drank any of it. Everything should be put to its proper use in this world. St Dunstan knew, as well as any one, the prerogatives of a jovial friar.”And so saying, he reached the harp, and entertained his guest with the following characteristic song, to a sort of derry-down chorus,appropriate to an old English ditty. 24
THE BAREFOOTED FRIAR.1.I’ll give thee, good fellow, a twelvemonth or twain,To search Europe through, from Byzantium to Spain;But ne’er shall you ﬁnd, should you search till you tire,So happy a man as the Barefooted Friar.2.Your knight for his lady pricks forth in career,And is brought home at even-song prick’d through with a spear;I confess him in haste—for his lady desiresNo comfort on earth save the Barefooted Friar’s.3.Your monarch?—Pshaw! many a prince has been knownTo barter his robes for our cowl and our gown,But which of us e’er felt the idle desireTo exchange for a crown the grey hood of a Friar!4.The Friar has walk’d out, and where’er he has gone,The land and its fatness is mark’d for his own;He can roam where he lists, he can stop when he tires,For every man’s house is the Barefooted Friar’s.5.He’s expected at noon, and no wight till he comesMay profane the great chair, or the porridge of plumsFor the best of the cheer, and the seat by the ﬁre,Is the undenied right of the Barefooted Friar.6.He’s expected at night, and the pasty’s made hot,They broach the brown ale, and they ﬁll the black pot,And the goodwife would wish the goodman in the mire,Ere he lack’d a soft pillow, the Barefooted Friar.7.Long ﬂourish the sandal, the cord, and the cope,The dread of the devil and trust of the Pope;For to gather life’s roses, unscathed by the briar,Is granted alone to the Barefooted Friar.“By my troth,” said the knight, “thou hast sung well and lustily, and in high praise of thine order. And, talking of the devil, HolyClerk, are you not afraid that he may pay you a visit during some of your uncanonical pastimes?”“I uncanonical!” answered the hermit; “I scorn the charge—I scorn it with my heels!—I serve the duty of my chapel duly and truly—Two masses daily, morning and evening, primes, noons, and vespers, ‘aves, credos, paters’—”“Excepting moonlight nights, when the venison is in season,” said his guest.“‘Exceptis excipiendis’” replied the hermit, “as our old abbot taught me to say, when impertinent laymen should ask me if I keptevery punctilio of mine order.”“True, holy father,” said the knight; “but the devil is apt to keep an eye on such exceptions; he goes about, thou knowest, like aroaring lion.”“Let him roar here if he dares,” said the friar; “a touch of my cord will make him roar as loud as the tongs of St Dunstan himselfdid. I never feared man, and I as little fear the devil and his imps. Saint Dunstan, Saint Dubric, Saint Winibald, Saint Winifred, SaintSwibert, Saint Willick, not forgetting Saint Thomas a Kent, and my own poor merits to speed, I defy every devil of them, come cutand long tail.—But to let you into a secret, I never speak upon such subjects, my friend, until after morning vespers.”He changed the conversation; fast and furious grew the mirth of the parties, and many a song was exchanged betwixt them, whentheir revels were interrupted by a loud knocking at the door of the hermitage.The occasion of this interruption we can only explain by resuming the adventures of another set of our characters; for, like oldAriosto, we do not pique ourselves upon continuing uniformly to keep company with any one personage of our drama.CHAPTER XVIIIAway! our journey lies through dell and dingle,Where the blithe fawn trips by its timid mother,Where the broad oak, with intercepting boughs,Chequers the sunbeam in the green-sward alley—Up and away!—for lovely paths are theseTo tread, when the glad Sun is on his throneLess pleasant, and less safe, when Cynthia’s lampWith doubtful glimmer lights the dreary forest.ETTRICK FORESTWhen Cedric the Saxon saw his son drop down senseless in the lists at Ashby, his ﬁrst impulse was to order him into the custodyand care of his own attendants, but the words choked in his throat. He could not bring himself to acknowledge, in presence of such anassembly, the son whom he had renounced and disinherited. He ordered, however, Oswald to keep an eye upon him; and directed thatofﬁcer, with two of his serfs, to convey Ivanhoe to Ashby as soon as the crowd had dispersed. Oswald, however, was anticipated inthis good ofﬁce. The crowd dispersed, indeed, but the knight was nowhere to be seen.It was in vain that Cedric’s cupbearer looked around for his young master—he saw the bloody spot on which he had lately sunkdown, but himself he saw no longer; it seemed as if the fairies had conveyed him from the spot. Perhaps Oswald (for the Saxons werevery superstitious) might have adopted some such hypothesis, to account for Ivanhoe’s disappearance, had he not suddenly cast hiseye upon a person attired like a squire, in whom he recognised the features of his fellow-servant Gurth. Anxious concerning hismaster’s fate, and in despair at his sudden disappearance, the translated swineherd was searching for him everywhere, and hadneglected, in doing so, the concealment on which his own safety depended. Oswald deemed it his duty to secure Gurth, as a fugitive ofwhose fate his master was to judge.Renewing his enquiries concerning the fate of Ivanhoe, the only information which the cupbearer could collect from the bystanderswas, that the knight had been raised with care by certain well-attired grooms, and placed in a litter belonging to a lady among thespectators, which had immediately transported him out of the press. Oswald, on receiving this intelligence, resolved to return to hismaster for farther instructions, carrying along with him Gurth, whom he considered in some sort as a deserter from the service ofCedric.The Saxon had been under very intense and agonizing apprehensions concerning his son; for Nature had asserted her rights, in spiteof the patriotic stoicism which laboured to disown her. But no sooner was he informed that Ivanhoe was in careful, and probably infriendly hands, than the paternal anxiety which had been excited by the dubiety of his fate, gave way anew to the feeling of injuredpride and resentment, at what he termed Wilfred’s ﬁlial disobedience.“Let him wander his way,” said he—“let those leech his wounds for whose sake he encountered them. He is ﬁtter to do the jugglingtricks of the Norman chivalry than to maintain the fame and honour of his English ancestry with the glaive and brown-bill, the goodold weapons of his country.”“If to maintain the honour of ancestry,” said Rowena, who was present, “it is sufﬁcient to be wise in council and brave in execution—to be boldest among the bold, and gentlest among the gentle, I know no voice, save his father’s—-”“Be silent, Lady Rowena!—on this subject only I hear you not. Prepare yourself for the Prince’s festival: we have been summonedthither with unwonted circumstance of honour and of courtesy, such as the haughty Normans have rarely used to our race since thefatal day of Hastings. Thither will I go, were it only to show these proud Normans how little the fate of a son, who could defeat theirbravest, can affect a Saxon.”“Thither,” said Rowena, “do I NOT go; and I pray you to beware, lest what you mean for courage and constancy, shall be accountedhardness of heart.”“Remain at home, then, ungrateful lady,” answered Cedric; “thine is the hard heart, which can sacriﬁce the weal of an oppressedpeople to an idle and unauthorized attachment. I seek the noble Athelstane, and with him attend the banquet of John of Anjou.”He went accordingly to the banquet, of which we have already mentioned the principal events. Immediately upon retiring from thecastle, the Saxon thanes, with their attendants, took horse; and it was during the bustle which attended their doing so, that Cedric, forthe ﬁrst time, cast his eyes upon the deserter Gurth. The noble Saxon had returned from the banquet, as we have seen, in no veryplacid humour, and wanted but a pretext for wreaking his anger upon some one.“The gyves!” he said, “the gyves!—Oswald—Hundibert!—Dogs and villains!—why leave ye the knave unfettered?”Without daring to remonstrate, the companions of Gurth bound him with a halter, as the readiest cord which occurred. He submittedto the operation without remonstrance, except that, darting a reproachful look at his master, he said, “This comes of loving your ﬂeshand blood better than mine own.”“To horse, and forward!” said Cedric.“It is indeed full time,” said the noble Athelstane; “for, if we ride not the faster, the worthy Abbot Waltheoff’s preparations for arere-supper 25 will be altogether spoiled.”The travellers, however, used such speed as to reach the convent of St Withold’s before the apprehended evil took place. The Abbot,himself of ancient Saxon descent, received the noble Saxons with the profuse and exuberant hospitality of their nation, wherein theyindulged to a late, or rather an early hour; nor did they take leave of their reverend host the next morning until they had shared withhim a sumptuous refection.As the cavalcade left the court of the monastery, an incident happened somewhat alarming to the Saxons, who, of all people ofEurope, were most addicted to a superstitious observance of omens, and to whose opinions can be traced most of those notions uponsuch subjects, still to be found among our popular antiquities. For the Normans being a mixed race, and better informed according tothe information of the times, had lost most of the superstitious prejudices which their ancestors had brought from Scandinavia, andpiqued themselves upon thinking freely on such topics.In the present instance, the apprehension of impending evil was inspired by no less respectable a prophet than a large lean blackdog, which, sitting upright, howled most piteously as the foremost riders left the gate, and presently afterwards, barking wildly, andjumping to and fro, seemed bent upon attaching itself to the party.“I like not that music, father Cedric,” said Athelstane; for by this title of respect he was accustomed to address him.“Nor I either, uncle,” said Wamba; “I greatly fear we shall have to pay the piper.”“In my mind,” said Athelstane, upon whose memory the Abbot’s good ale (for Burton was already famous for that genial liquor)had made a favourable impression,—“in my mind we had better turn back, and abide with the Abbot until the afternoon. It is unluckyto travel where your path is crossed by a monk, a hare, or a howling dog, until you have eaten your next meal.”“Away!” said Cedric, impatiently; “the day is already too short for our journey. For the dog, I know it to be the cur of the runawayslave Gurth, a useless fugitive like its master.”So saying, and rising at the same time in his stirrups, impatient at the interruption of his journey, he launched his javelin at poorFangs—for Fangs it was, who, having traced his master thus far upon his stolen expedition, had here lost him, and was now, in hisuncouth way, rejoicing at his reappearance. The javelin inﬂicted a wound upon the animal’s shoulder, and narrowly missed pinninghim to the earth; and Fangs ﬂed howling from the presence of the enraged thane. Gurth’s heart swelled within him; for he felt thismeditated slaughter of his faithful adherent in a degree much deeper than the harsh treatment he had himself received. Having in vainattempted to raise his hand to his eyes, he said to Wamba, who, seeing his master’s ill humour had prudently retreated to the rear, “Ipray thee, do me the kindness to wipe my eyes with the skirt of thy mantle; the dust offends me, and these bonds will not let me helpmyself one way or another.”Wamba did him the service he required, and they rode side by side for some time, during which Gurth maintained a moody silence.At length he could repress his feelings no longer.“Friend Wamba,” said he, “of all those who are fools enough to serve Cedric, thou alone hast dexterity enough to make thy follyacceptable to him. Go to him, therefore, and tell him that neither for love nor fear will Gurth serve him longer. He may strike the headfrom me—he may scourge me—he may load me with irons—but henceforth he shall never compel me either to love or to obey him.Go to him, then, and tell him that Gurth the son of Beowulph renounces his service.”Go to him, then, and tell him that Gurth the son of Beowulph renounces his service.”“Assuredly,” said Wamba, “fool as I am, I shall not do your fool’s errand. Cedric hath another javelin stuck into his girdle, and thouknowest he does not always miss his mark.”“I care not,” replied Gurth, “how soon he makes a mark of me. Yesterday he left Wilfred, my young master, in his blood. To-day hehas striven to kill before my face the only other living creature that ever showed me kindness. By St Edmund, St Dunstan, St Withold,St Edward the Confessor, and every other Saxon saint in the calendar,” (for Cedric never swore by any that was not of Saxon lineage,and all his household had the same limited devotion,) “I will never forgive him!”“To my thinking now,” said the Jester, who was frequently wont to act as peace-maker in the family, “our master did not propose tohurt Fangs, but only to affright him. For, if you observed, he rose in his stirrups, as thereby meaning to overcast the mark; and so hewould have done, but Fangs happening to bound up at the very moment, received a scratch, which I will be bound to heal with apenny’s breadth of tar.”“If I thought so,” said Gurth—“if I could but think so—but no—I saw the javelin was well aimed—I heard it whizz through the airwith all the wrathful malevolence of him who cast it, and it quivered after it had pitched in the ground, as if with regret for havingmissed its mark. By the hog dear to St Anthony, I renounce him!”And the indignant swineherd resumed his sullen silence, which no efforts of the Jester could again induce him to break.Meanwhile Cedric and Athelstane, the leaders of the troop, conversed together on the state of the land, on the dissensions of theroyal family, on the feuds and quarrels among the Norman nobles, and on the chance which there was that the oppressed Saxons mightbe able to free themselves from the yoke of the Normans, or at least to elevate themselves into national consequence andindependence, during the civil convulsions which were likely to ensue. On this subject Cedric was all animation. The restoration of theindependence of his race was the idol of his heart, to which he had willingly sacriﬁced domestic happiness and the interests of his ownson. But, in order to achieve this great revolution in favour of the native English, it was necessary that they should be united amongthemselves, and act under an acknowledged head. The necessity of choosing their chief from the Saxon blood-royal was not onlyevident in itself, but had been made a solemn condition by those whom Cedric had intrusted with his secret plans and hopes.Athelstane had this quality at least; and though he had few mental accomplishments or talents to recommend him as a leader, he hadstill a goodly person, was no coward, had been accustomed to martial exercises, and seemed willing to defer to the advice ofcounsellors more wise than himself. Above all, he was known to be liberal and hospitable, and believed to be good-natured. Butwhatever pretensions Athelstane had to be considered as head of the Saxon confederacy, many of that nation were disposed to preferto the title of the Lady Rowena, who drew her descent from Alfred, and whose father having been a chief renowned for wisdom,courage, and generosity, his memory was highly honoured by his oppressed countrymen.It would have been no difﬁcult thing for Cedric, had he been so disposed, to have placed himself at the head of a third party, asformidable at least as any of the others. To counterbalance their royal descent, he had courage, activity, energy, and, above all, thatdevoted attachment to the cause which had procured him the epithet of The Saxon, and his birth was inferior to none, excepting onlythat of Athelstane and his ward. These qualities, however, were unalloyed by the slightest shade of selﬁshness; and, instead of dividingyet farther his weakened nation by forming a faction of his own, it was a leading part of Cedric’s plan to extinguish that which alreadyexisted, by promoting a marriage betwixt Rowena and Athelstane. An obstacle occurred to this his favourite project, in the mutualattachment of his ward and his son and hence the original cause of the banishment of Wilfred from the house of his father.This stern measure Cedric had adopted, in hopes that, during Wilfred’s absence, Rowena might relinquish her preference, but in thishope he was disappointed; a disappointment which might be attributed in part to the mode in which his ward had been educated.Cedric, to whom the name of Alfred was as that of a deity, had treated the sole remaining scion of that great monarch with a degree ofobservance, such as, perhaps, was in those days scarce paid to an acknowledged princess. Rowena’s will had been in almost all cases alaw to his household; and Cedric himself, as if determined that her sovereignty should be fully acknowledged within that little circle atleast, seemed to take a pride in acting as the ﬁrst of her subjects. Thus trained in the exercise not only of free will, but despoticauthority, Rowena was, by her previous education, disposed both to resist and to resent any attempt to control her affections, ordispose of her hand contrary to her inclinations, and to assert her independence in a case in which even those females who have beentrained up to obedience and subjection, are not infrequently apt to dispute the authority of guardians and parents. The opinions whichshe felt strongly, she avowed boldly; and Cedric, who could not free himself from his habitual deference to her opinions, felt totally ata loss how to enforce his authority of guardian.It was in vain that he attempted to dazzle her with the prospect of a visionary throne. Rowena, who possessed strong sense, neitherconsidered his plan as practicable, nor as desirable, so far as she was concerned, could it have been achieved. Without attempting toconceal her avowed preference of Wilfred of Ivanhoe, she declared that, were that favoured knight out of question, she would rathertake refuge in a convent, than share a throne with Athelstane, whom, having always despised, she now began, on account of thetrouble she received on his account, thoroughly to detest.Nevertheless, Cedric, whose opinions of women’s constancy was far from strong, persisted in using every means in his power tobring about the proposed match, in which he conceived he was rendering an important service to the Saxon cause. The sudden andromantic appearance of his son in the lists at Ashby, he had justly regarded as almost a death’s blow to his hopes. His paternalaffection, it is true, had for an instant gained the victory over pride and patriotism; but both had returned in full force, and under theirjoint operation, he was now bent upon making a determined effort for the union of Athelstane and Rowena, together with expeditingthose other measures which seemed necessary to forward the restoration of Saxon independence.On this last subject, he was now labouring with Athelstane, not without having reason, every now and then, to lament, like Hotspur,that he should have moved such a dish of skimmed milk to so honourable an action. Athelstane, it is true, was vain enough, and lovedto have his ears tickled with tales of his high descent, and of his right by inheritance to homage and sovereignty. But his petty vanitywas sufﬁciently gratiﬁed by receiving this homage at the hands of his immediate attendants, and of the Saxons who approached him. Ifhe had the courage to encounter danger, he at least hated the trouble of going to seek it; and while he agreed in the general principleslaid down by Cedric concerning the claim of the Saxons to independence, and was still more easily convinced of his own title to reignover them when that independence should be attained, yet when the means of asserting these rights came to be discussed, he was still“Athelstane the Unready,” slow, irresolute, procrastinating, and unenterprising. The warm and impassioned exhortations of Cedric hadas little effect upon his impassive temper, as red-hot balls alighting in the water, which produce a little sound and smoke, and areinstantly extinguished.If, leaving this task, which might be compared to spurring a tired jade, or to hammering upon cold iron, Cedric fell back to his wardRowena, he received little more satisfaction from conferring with her. For, as his presence interrupted the discourse between the ladyand her favourite attendant upon the gallantry and fate of Wilfred, Elgitha failed not to revenge both her mistress and herself, byrecurring to the overthrow of Athelstane in the lists, the most disagreeable subject which could greet the ears of Cedric. To this sturdySaxon, therefore, the day’s journey was fraught with all manner of displeasure and discomfort; so that he more than once internallycursed the tournament, and him who had proclaimed it, together with his own folly in ever thinking of going thither.At noon, upon the motion of Athelstane, the travellers paused in a woodland shade by a fountain, to repose their horses and partakeof some provisions, with which the hospitable Abbot had loaded a sumpter mule. Their repast was a pretty long one; and these severalinterruptions rendered it impossible for them to hope to reach Rotherwood without travelling all night, a conviction which inducedthem to proceed on their way at a more hasty pace than they had hitherto used.CHAPTER XIXA train of armed men, some noble dameEscorting, (so their scatter’d words discover’d,As unperceived I hung upon their rear,)Are close at hand, and mean to pass the nightWithin the castle.ORRA, A TRAGEDYThe travellers had now reached the verge of the wooded country, and were about to plunge into its recesses, held dangerous at thattime from the number of outlaws whom oppression and poverty had driven to despair, and who occupied the forests in such largebands as could easily bid deﬁance to the feeble police of the period. From these rovers, however, notwithstanding the lateness of thehour Cedric and Athelstane accounted themselves secure, as they had in attendance ten servants, besides Wamba and Gurth, whose aidcould not be counted upon, the one being a jester and the other a captive. It may be added, that in travelling thus late through theforest, Cedric and Athelstane relied on their descent and character, as well as their courage. The outlaws, whom the severity of theforest laws had reduced to this roving and desperate mode of life, were chieﬂy peasants and yeomen of Saxon descent, and weregenerally supposed to respect the persons and property of their countrymen.As the travellers journeyed on their way, they were alarmed by repeated cries for assistance; and when they rode up to the placefrom whence they came, they were surprised to ﬁnd a horse-litter placed upon the ground, beside which sat a young woman, richlydressed in the Jewish fashion, while an old man, whose yellow cap proclaimed him to belong to the same nation, walked up and downwith gestures expressive of the deepest despair, and wrung his hands, as if affected by some strange disaster.To the enquiries of Athelstane and Cedric, the old Jew could for some time only answer by invoking the protection of all thepatriarchs of the Old Testament successively against the sons of Ishmael, who were coming to smite them, hip and thigh, with the edgeof the sword. When he began to come to himself out of this agony of terror, Isaac of York (for it was our old friend) was at length ableto explain, that he had hired a body-guard of six men at Ashby, together with mules for carrying the litter of a sick friend. This partyhad undertaken to escort him as far as Doncaster. They had come thus far in safety; but having received information from a wood-cutter that there was a strong band of outlaws lying in wait in the woods before them, Isaac’s mercenaries had not only taken ﬂight, buthad carried off with them the horses which bore the litter and left the Jew and his daughter without the means either of defence or ofretreat, to be plundered, and probably murdered, by the banditti, who they expected every moment would bring down upon them.“Would it but please your valours,” added Isaac, in a tone of deep humiliation, “to permit the poor Jews to travel under your safeguard,I swear by the tables of our law, that never has favour been conferred upon a child of Israel since the days of our captivity, which shallbe more gratefully acknowledged.”“Dog of a Jew!” said Athelstane, whose memory was of that petty kind which stores up triﬂes of all kinds, but particularly triﬂingoffences, “dost not remember how thou didst beard us in the gallery at the tilt-yard? Fight or ﬂee, or compound with the outlaws asthou dost list, ask neither aid nor company from us; and if they rob only such as thee, who rob all the world, I, for mine own share,shall hold them right honest folk.”Cedric did not assent to the severe proposal of his companion. “We shall do better,” said he, “to leave them two of our attendantsand two horses to convey them back to the next village. It will diminish our strength but little; and with your good sword, nobleAthelstane, and the aid of those who remain, it will be light work for us to face twenty of those runagates.”Rowena, somewhat alarmed by the mention of outlaws in force, and so near them, strongly seconded the proposal of her guardian.But Rebecca suddenly quitting her dejected posture, and making her way through the attendants to the palfrey of the Saxon lady, kneltdown, and, after the Oriental fashion in addressing superiors, kissed the hem of Rowena’s garment. Then rising, and throwing back herveil, she implored her in the great name of the God whom they both worshipped, and by that revelation of the Law upon Mount Sinai,in which they both believed, that she would have compassion upon them, and suffer them to go forward under their safeguard. “It isnot for myself that I pray this favour,” said Rebecca; “nor is it even for that poor old man. I know that to wrong and to spoil our nationis a light fault, if not a merit, with the Christians; and what is it to us whether it be done in the city, in the desert, or in the ﬁeld? But itis in the name of one dear to many, and dear even to you, that I beseech you to let this sick person be transported with care andtenderness under your protection. For, if evil chance him, the last moment of your life would be embittered with regret for denyingthat which I ask of you.”The noble and solemn air with which Rebecca made this appeal, gave it double weight with the fair Saxon.“The man is old and feeble,” she said to her guardian, “the maiden young and beautiful, their friend sick and in peril of his life—Jews though they be, we cannot as Christians leave them in this extremity. Let them unload two of the sumpter-mules, and put thebaggage behind two of the serfs. The mules may transport the litter, and we have led horses for the old man and his daughter.”Cedric readily assented to what she proposed, and Athelstane only added the condition, “that they should travel in the rear of thewhole party, where Wamba,” he said, “might attend them with his shield of boar’s brawn.”“I have left my shield in the tilt-yard,” answered the Jester, “as has been the fate of many a better knight than myself.”Athelstane coloured deeply, for such had been his own fate on the last day of the tournament; while Rowena, who was pleased inthe same proportion, as if to make amends for the brutal jest of her unfeeling suitor, requested Rebecca to ride by her side.“It were not ﬁt I should do so,” answered Rebecca, with proud humility, “where my society might be held a disgrace to myprotectress.”By this time the change of baggage was hastily achieved; for the single word “outlaws” rendered every one sufﬁciently alert, andthe approach of twilight made the sound yet more impressive. Amid the bustle, Gurth was taken from horseback, in the course ofwhich removal he prevailed upon the Jester to slack the cord with which his arms were bound. It was so negligently refastened,perhaps intentionally, on the part of Wamba, that Gurth found no difﬁculty in freeing his arms altogether from bondage, and then,gliding into the thicket, he made his escape from the party.The bustle had been considerable, and it was some time before Gurth was missed; for, as he was to be placed for the rest of thejourney behind a servant, every one supposed that some other of his companions had him under his custody, and when it began to bewhispered among them that Gurth had actually disappeared, they were under such immediate expectation of an attack from theoutlaws, that it was not held convenient to pay much attention to the circumstance.The path upon which the party travelled was now so narrow, as not to admit, with any sort of convenience, above two riders abreast,and began to descend into a dingle, traversed by a brook whose banks were broken, swampy, and overgrown with dwarf willows.Cedric and Athelstane, who were at the head of their retinue, saw the risk of being attacked at this pass; but neither of them having hadmuch practice in war, no better mode of preventing the danger occurred to them than that they should hasten through the deﬁle as fastas possible. Advancing, therefore, without much order, they had just crossed the brook with a part of their followers, when they wereassailed in front, ﬂank, and rear at once, with an impetuosity to which, in their confused and ill-prepared condition, it was impossibleto offer effectual resistance. The shout of “A white dragon!—a white dragon!—Saint George for merry England!” war-cries adoptedby the assailants, as belonging to their assumed character of Saxon outlaws, was heard on every side, and on every side enemiesappeared with a rapidity of advance and attack which seemed to multiply their numbers.Both the Saxon chiefs were made prisoners at the same moment, and each under circumstances expressive of his character. Cedric,the instant that an enemy appeared, launched at him his remaining javelin, which, taking better effect than that which he had hurled atFangs, nailed the man against an oak-tree that happened to be close behind him. Thus far successful, Cedric spurred his horse against asecond, drawing his sword at the same time, and striking with such inconsiderate fury, that his weapon encountered a thick branchwhich hung over him, and he was disarmed by the violence of his own blow. He was instantly made prisoner, and pulled from hishorse by two or three of the banditti who crowded around him. Athelstane shared his captivity, his bridle having been seized, and hehimself forcibly dismounted, long before he could draw his weapon, or assume any posture of effectual defence.The attendants, embarrassed with baggage, surprised and terriﬁed at the fate of their masters, fell an easy prey to the assailants;while the Lady Rowena, in the centre of the cavalcade, and the Jew and his daughter in the rear, experienced the same misfortune.Of all the train none escaped except Wamba, who showed upon the occasion much more courage than those who pretended togreater sense. He possessed himself of a sword belonging to one of the domestics, who was just drawing it with a tardy and irresolutehand, laid it about him like a lion, drove back several who approached him, and made a brave though ineffectual attempt to succourhis master. Finding himself overpowered, the Jester at length threw himself from his horse, plunged into the thicket, and, favoured bythe general confusion, escaped from the scene of action. Yet the valiant Jester, as soon as he found himself safe, hesitated more thanonce whether he should not turn back and share the captivity of a master to whom he was sincerely attached.“I have heard men talk of the blessings of freedom,” he said to himself, “but I wish any wise man would teach me what use to makeof it now that I have it.”As he pronounced these words aloud, a voice very near him called out in a low and cautious tone, “Wamba!” and, at the same time,a dog, which he recognised to be Fangs, jumped up and fawned upon him. “Gurth!” answered Wamba, with the same caution, and theswineherd immediately stood before him.“What is the matter?” said he eagerly; “what mean these cries, and that clashing of swords?”“Only a trick of the times,” said Wamba; “they are all prisoners.”“Who are prisoners?” exclaimed Gurth, impatiently.“My lord, and my lady, and Athelstane, and Hundibert, and Oswald.”“In the name of God!” said Gurth, “how came they prisoners?—and to whom?”“Our master was too ready to ﬁght,” said the Jester; “and Athelstane was not ready enough, and no other person was ready at all.And they are prisoners to green cassocks, and black visors. And they lie all tumbled about on the green, like the crab-apples that youshake down to your swine. And I would laugh at it,” said the honest Jester, “if I could for weeping.” And he shed tears of unfeignedsorrow.Gurth’s countenance kindled—“Wamba,” he said, “thou hast a weapon, and thy heart was ever stronger than thy brain,—we areonly two—but a sudden attack from men of resolution will do much—follow me!”“Whither?—and for what purpose?” said the Jester.“To rescue Cedric.”“But you have renounced his service but now,” said Wamba.“That,” said Gurth, “was but while he was fortunate—follow me!”As the Jester was about to obey, a third person suddenly made his appearance, and commanded them both to halt. From his dressand arms, Wamba would have conjectured him to be one of those outlaws who had just assailed his master; but, besides that he woreno mask, the glittering baldric across his shoulder, with the rich bugle-horn which it supported, as well as the calm and commandingexpression of his voice and manner, made him, notwithstanding the twilight, recognise Locksley the yeoman, who had beenvictorious, under such disadvantageous circumstances, in the contest for the prize of archery.“What is the meaning of all this,” said he, “or who is it that riﬂe, and ransom, and make prisoners, in these forests?”“You may look at their cassocks close by,” said Wamba, “and see whether they be thy children’s coats or no—for they are as likethine own, as one green pea-cod is to another.”“I will learn that presently,” answered Locksley; “and I charge ye, on peril of your lives, not to stir from the place where ye stand,until I have returned. Obey me, and it shall be the better for you and your masters.—Yet stay, I must render myself as like these men aspossible.”So saying he unbuckled his baldric with the bugle, took a feather from his cap, and gave them to Wamba; then drew a vizard fromhis pouch, and, repeating his charges to them to stand fast, went to execute his purposes of reconnoitring.“Shall we stand fast, Gurth?” said Wamba; “or shall we e’en give him leg-bail? In my foolish mind, he had all the equipage of athief too much in readiness, to be himself a true man.”“Let him be the devil,” said Gurth, “an he will. We can be no worse of waiting his return. If he belong to that party, he must alreadyhave given them the alarm, and it will avail nothing either to ﬁght or ﬂy. Besides, I have late experience, that errant thieves are not theworst men in the world to have to deal with.”The yeoman returned in the course of a few minutes.“Friend Gurth,” he said, “I have mingled among yon men, and have learnt to whom they belong, and whither they are bound. Thereis, I think, no chance that they will proceed to any actual violence against their prisoners. For three men to attempt them at thismoment, were little else than madness; for they are good men of war, and have, as such, placed sentinels to give the alarm when anyone approaches. But I trust soon to gather such a force, as may act in deﬁance of all their precautions; you are both servants, and, as Ithink, faithful servants, of Cedric the Saxon, the friend of the rights of Englishmen. He shall not want English hands to help him in thisextremity. Come then with me, until I gather more aid.”So saying, he walked through the wood at a great pace, followed by the jester and the swineherd. It was not consistent withWamba’s humour to travel long in silence.“I think,” said he, looking at the baldric and bugle which he still carried, “that I saw the arrow shot which won this gay prize, andthat not so long since as Christmas.”“And I,” said Gurth, “could take it on my halidome, that I have heard the voice of the good yeoman who won it, by night as well asby day, and that the moon is not three days older since I did so.”“Mine honest friends,” replied the yeoman, “who, or what I am, is little to the present purpose; should I free your master, you willhave reason to think me the best friend you have ever had in your lives. And whether I am known by one name or another—orwhether I can draw a bow as well or better than a cow-keeper, or whether it is my pleasure to walk in sunshine or by moonlight, arematters, which, as they do not concern you, so neither need ye busy yourselves respecting them.”“Our heads are in the lion’s mouth,” said Wamba, in a whisper to Gurth, “get them out how we can.”“Hush—be silent,” said Gurth. “Offend him not by thy folly, and I trust sincerely that all will go well.”CHAPTER XXWhen autumn nights were long and drear,    And forest walks were dark and dim,How sweetly on the pilgrim’s ear    Was wont to steal the hermit’s hymnDevotion borrows Music’s tone,    And Music took Devotion’s wing;And, like the bird that hails the sun,    They soar to heaven, and soaring sing.THE HERMIT OF ST CLEMENT’S WELLIt was after three hours’ good walking that the servants of Cedric, with their mysterious guide, arrived at a small opening in theforest, in the centre of which grew an oak-tree of enormous magnitude, throwing its twisted branches in every direction. Beneath thistree four or ﬁve yeomen lay stretched on the ground, while another, as sentinel, walked to and fro in the moonlight shade.Upon hearing the sound of feet approaching, the watch instantly gave the alarm, and the sleepers as suddenly started up and benttheir bows. Six arrows placed on the string were pointed towards the quarter from which the travellers approached, when their guide,being recognised, was welcomed with every token of respect and attachment, and all signs and fears of a rough reception at oncesubsided.“Where is the Miller?” was his ﬁrst question.“On the road towards Rotherham.”“With how many?” demanded the leader, for such he seemed to be.“With six men, and good hope of booty, if it please St Nicholas.”“Devoutly spoken,” said Locksley; “and where is Allan-a-Dale?”“Walked up towards the Watling-street, to watch for the Prior of Jorvaulx.”“That is well thought on also,” replied the Captain;—“and where is the Friar?”“In his cell.”“Thither will I go,” said Locksley. “Disperse and seek your companions. Collect what force you can, for there’s game afoot thatmust be hunted hard, and will turn to bay. Meet me here by daybreak.—And stay,” he added, “I have forgotten what is most necessaryof the whole—Two of you take the road quickly towards Torquilstone, the Castle of Front-de-Bœuf. A set of gallants, who have beenmasquerading in such guise as our own, are carrying a band of prisoners thither—Watch them closely, for even if they reach the castlebefore we collect our force, our honour is concerned to punish them, and we will ﬁnd means to do so. Keep a close watch on themtherefore; and dispatch one of your comrades, the lightest of foot, to bring the news of the yeomen thereabout.”They promised implicit obedience, and departed with alacrity on their different errands. In the meanwhile, their leader and his twocompanions, who now looked upon him with great respect, as well as some fear, pursued their way to the Chapel of Copmanhurst.When they had reached the little moonlight glade, having in front the reverend, though ruinous chapel, and the rude hermitage, sowell suited to ascetic devotion, Wamba whispered to Gurth, “If this be the habitation of a thief, it makes good the old proverb, Thenearer the church the farther from God.—And by my coxcomb,” he added, “I think it be even so—Hearken but to the black sanctuswhich they are singing in the hermitage!”In fact the anchorite and his guest were performing, at the full extent of their very powerful lungs, an old drinking song, of whichthis was the burden:—“Come, trowl the brown bowl to me,    Bully boy, bully boy,Come, trowl the brown bowl to me:    Ho! jolly Jenkin, I spy a knave in drinking,Come, trowl the brown bowl to me.”“Now, that is not ill sung,” said Wamba, who had thrown in a few of his own ﬂourishes to help out the chorus. “But who, in thesaint’s name, ever expected to have heard such a jolly chant come from out a hermit’s cell at midnight!”“Marry, that should I,” said Gurth, “for the jolly Clerk of Copmanhurst is a known man, and kills half the deer that are stolen in thiswalk. Men say that the keeper has complained to his ofﬁcial, and that he will be stripped of his cowl and cope altogether, if he keepsnot better order.”While they were thus speaking, Locksley’s loud and repeated knocks had at length disturbed the anchorite and his guest. “By mybeads,” said the hermit, stopping short in a grand ﬂourish, “here come more benighted guests. I would not for my cowl that they foundus in this goodly exercise. All men have their enemies, good Sir Sluggard; and there be those malignant enough to construe thehospitable refreshment which I have been offering to you, a weary traveller, for the matter of three short hours, into sheer drunkennessand debauchery, vices alike alien to my profession and my disposition.”“Base calumniators!” replied the knight; “I would I had the chastising of them. Nevertheless, Holy Clerk, it is true that all have theirenemies; and there be those in this very land whom I would rather speak to through the bars of my helmet than barefaced.”“Get thine iron pot on thy head then, friend Sluggard, as quickly as thy nature will permit,” said the hermit, “while I remove thesepewter ﬂagons, whose late contents run strangely in mine own pate; and to drown the clatter—for, in faith, I feel somewhat unsteady—strike into the tune which thou hearest me sing; it is no matter for the words—I scarce know them myself.”So saying, he struck up a thundering “De profundis clamavi”, under cover of which he removed the apparatus of their banquet:while the knight, laughing heartily, and arming himself all the while, assisted his host with his voice from time to time as his mirthpermitted.“What devil’s matins are you after at this hour?” said a voice from without.“Heaven forgive you, Sir Traveller!” said the hermit, whose own noise, and perhaps his nocturnal potations, prevented fromrecognising accents which were tolerably familiar to him—“Wend on your way, in the name of God and Saint Dunstan, and disturbnot the devotions of me and my holy brother.”“Mad priest,” answered the voice from without, “open to Locksley!”“All’s safe—all’s right,” said the hermit to his companion.“But who is he?” said the Black Knight; “it imports me much to know.”“Who is he?” answered the hermit; “I tell thee he is a friend.”“But what friend?” answered the knight; “for he may be friend to thee and none of mine?”“What friend?” replied the hermit; “that, now, is one of the questions that is more easily asked than answered. What friend?—why,he is, now that I bethink me a little, the very same honest keeper I told thee of a while since.”“Ay, as honest a keeper as thou art a pious hermit,” replied the knight, “I doubt it not. But undo the door to him before he beat itfrom its hinges.”The dogs, in the meantime, which had made a dreadful baying at the commencement of the disturbance, seemed now to recognisethe voice of him who stood without; for, totally changing their manner, they scratched and whined at the door, as if interceding for hisadmission. The hermit speedily unbolted his portal, and admitted Locksley, with his two companions.“Why, hermit,” was the yeoman’s ﬁrst question as soon as he beheld the knight, “what boon companion hast thou here?”“A brother of our order,” replied the friar, shaking his head; “we have been at our orisons all night.”“He is a monk of the church militant, I think,” answered Locksley; “and there be more of them abroad. I tell thee, friar, thou mustlay down the rosary and take up the quarter-staff; we shall need every one of our merry men, whether clerk or layman.—But,” headded, taking him a step aside, “art thou mad? to give admittance to a knight thou dost not know? Hast thou forgot our articles?”“Not know him!” replied the friar, boldly, “I know him as well as the beggar knows his dish.”“And what is his name, then?” demanded Locksley.“His name,” said the hermit—“his name is Sir Anthony of Scrabelstone—as if I would drink with a man, and did not know hisname!”“Thou hast been drinking more than enough, friar,” said the woodsman, “and, I fear, prating more than enough too.”“Good yeoman,” said the knight, coming forward, “be not wroth with my merry host. He did but afford me the hospitality which Iwould have compelled from him if he had refused it.”“Thou compel!” said the friar; “wait but till have changed this grey gown for a green cassock, and if I make not a quarter-staff ringtwelve upon thy pate, I am neither true clerk nor good woodsman.”While he spoke thus, he stript off his gown, and appeared in a close black buckram doublet and drawers, over which he speedily didon a cassock of green, and hose of the same colour. “I pray thee truss my points,” said he to Wamba, “and thou shalt have a cup ofsack for thy labour.”“Gramercy for thy sack,” said Wamba; “but think’st thou it is lawful for me to aid you to transmew thyself from a holy hermit into asinful forester?”“Never fear,” said the hermit; “I will but confess the sins of my green cloak to my greyfriar’s frock, and all shall be well again.”“Amen!” answered the Jester; “a broadcloth penitent should have a sackcloth confessor, and your frock may absolve my motleydoublet into the bargain.”So saying, he accommodated the friar with his assistance in tying the endless number of points, as the laces which attached the hoseto the doublet were then termed.While they were thus employed, Locksley led the knight a little apart, and addressed him thus:—“Deny it not, Sir Knight—you arehe who decided the victory to the advantage of the English against the strangers on the second day of the tournament at Ashby.”“And what follows if you guess truly, good yeoman?” replied the knight.“I should in that case hold you,” replied the yeoman, “a friend to the weaker party.”“Such is the duty of a true knight at least,” replied the Black Champion; “and I would not willingly that there were reason to thinkotherwise of me.”“But for my purpose,” said the yeoman, “thou shouldst be as well a good Englishman as a good knight; for that, which I have tospeak of, concerns, indeed, the duty of every honest man, but is more especially that of a true-born native of England.”“You can speak to no one,” replied the knight, “to whom England, and the life of every Englishman, can be dearer than to me.”“I would willingly believe so,” said the woodsman, “for never had this country such need to be supported by those who love her.Hear me, and I will tell thee of an enterprise, in which, if thou be’st really that which thou seemest, thou mayst take an honourablepart. A band of villains, in the disguise of better men than themselves, have made themselves master of the person of a nobleEnglishman, called Cedric the Saxon, together with his ward, and his friend Athelstane of Coningsburgh, and have transported them toa castle in this forest, called Torquilstone. I ask of thee, as a good knight and a good Englishman, wilt thou aid in their rescue?”“I am bound by my vow to do so,” replied the knight; “but I would willingly know who you are, who request my assistance in theirbehalf?”“I am,” said the forester, “a nameless man; but I am the friend of my country, and of my country’s friends—With this account of meyou must for the present remain satisﬁed, the more especially since you yourself desire to continue unknown. Believe, however, thatmy word, when pledged, is as inviolate as if I wore golden spurs.”“I willingly believe it,” said the knight; “I have been accustomed to study men’s countenances, and I can read in thine honesty andresolution. I will, therefore, ask thee no further questions, but aid thee in setting at freedom these oppressed captives; which done, Itrust we shall part better acquainted, and well satisﬁed with each other.”“So,” said Wamba to Gurth,—for the friar being now fully equipped, the Jester, having approached to the other side of the hut, hadheard the conclusion of the conversation,—“So we have got a new ally?—I trust the valour of the knight will be truer metal than thereligion of the hermit, or the honesty of the yeoman; for this Locksley looks like a born deer-stealer, and the priest like a lustyhypocrite.”“Hold thy peace, Wamba,” said Gurth; “it may all be as thou dost guess; but were the horned devil to rise and proffer me hisassistance to set at liberty Cedric and the Lady Rowena, I fear I should hardly have religion enough to refuse the foul ﬁend’s offer, andbid him get behind me.”The friar was now completely accoutred as a yeoman, with sword and buckler, bow, and quiver, and a strong partisan over hisshoulder. He left his cell at the head of the party, and, having carefully locked the door, deposited the key under the threshold.“Art thou in condition to do good service, friar,” said Locksley, “or does the brown bowl still run in thy head?”“Not more than a drought of St Dunstan’s fountain will allay,” answered the priest; “something there is of a whizzing in my brain,and of instability in my legs, but you shall presently see both pass away.”So saying, he stepped to the stone basin, in which the waters of the fountain as they fell formed bubbles which danced in the whitemoonlight, and took so long a drought as if he had meant to exhaust the spring.“When didst thou drink as deep a drought of water before, Holy Clerk of Copmanhurst?” said the Black Knight.“Never since my wine-butt leaked, and let out its liquor by an illegal vent,” replied the friar, “and so left me nothing to drink but mypatron’s bounty here.”Then plunging his hands and head into the fountain, he washed from them all marks of the midnight revel.Thus refreshed and sobered, the jolly priest twirled his heavy partisan round his head with three ﬁngers, as if he had been balancinga reed, exclaiming at the same time, “Where be those false ravishers, who carry off wenches against their will? May the foul ﬁend ﬂyoff with me, if I am not man enough for a dozen of them.”“Swearest thou, Holy Clerk?” said the Black Knight.“Clerk me no Clerks,” replied the transformed priest; “by Saint George and the Dragon, I am no longer a shaveling than while myfrock is on my back—When I am cased in my green cassock, I will drink, swear, and woo a lass, with any blithe forester in the WestRiding.”“Come on, Jack Priest,” said Locksley, “and be silent; thou art as noisy as a whole convent on a holy eve, when the Father Abbothas gone to bed.—Come on you, too, my masters, tarry not to talk of it—I say, come on, we must collect all our forces, and fewenough we shall have, if we are to storm the Castle of Reginald Front-de-Bœuf.”“What! is it Front-de-Bœuf,” said the Black Knight, “who has stopt on the king’s highway the king’s liege subjects?—Is he turnedthief and oppressor?”“Oppressor he ever was,” said Locksley.“And for thief,” said the priest, “I doubt if ever he were even half so honest a man as many a thief of my acquaintance.”“Move on, priest, and be silent,” said the yeoman; “it were better you led the way to the place of rendezvous, than say what shouldbe left unsaid, both in decency and prudence.”CHAPTER XXIAlas, how many hours and years have past,Since human forms have round this table sate,Or lamp, or taper, on its surface gleam’d!Methinks, I hear the sound of time long pass’dStill murmuring o’er us, in the lofty voidOf these dark arches, like the ling’ring voicesOf those who long within their graves have slept.ORRA, A TRAGEDYWhile these measures were taking in behalf of Cedric and his companions, the armed men by whom the latter had been seized,hurried their captives along towards the place of security, where they intended to imprison them. But darkness came on fast, and thepaths of the wood seemed but imperfectly known to the marauders. They were compelled to make several long halts, and once ortwice to return on their road to resume the direction which they wished to pursue. The summer morn had dawned upon them ere theycould travel in full assurance that they held the right path. But conﬁdence returned with light, and the cavalcade now moved rapidlyforward. Meanwhile, the following dialogue took place between the two leaders of the banditti.“It is time thou shouldst leave us, Sir Maurice,” said the Templar to De Bracy, “in order to prepare the second part of thy mystery.Thou art next, thou knowest, to act the Knight Deliverer.”“I have thought better of it,” said De Bracy; “I will not leave thee till the prize is fairly deposited in Front-de-Bœuf’s castle. Therewill I appear before the Lady Rowena in mine own shape, and trust that she will set down to the vehemence of my passion theviolence of which I have been guilty.”“And what has made thee change thy plan, De Bracy?” replied the Knight Templar.“That concerns thee nothing,” answered his companion.“I would hope, however, Sir Knight,” said the Templar, “that this alteration of measures arises from no suspicion of my honourablemeaning, such as Fitzurse endeavoured to instil into thee?”“My thoughts are my own,” answered De Bracy; “the ﬁend laughs, they say, when one thief robs another; and we know, that werehe to spit ﬁre and brimstone instead, it would never prevent a Templar from following his bent.”“Or the leader of a Free Company,” answered the Templar, “from dreading at the hands of a comrade and friend, the injustice hedoes to all mankind.”“This is unproﬁtable and perilous recrimination,” answered De Bracy; “sufﬁce it to say, I know the morals of the Temple-Order, andI will not give thee the power of cheating me out of the fair prey for which I have run such risks.”“Psha,” replied the Templar, “what hast thou to fear?—Thou knowest the vows of our order.”“Right well,” said De Bracy, “and also how they are kept. Come, Sir Templar, the laws of gallantry have a liberal interpretation inPalestine, and this is a case in which I will trust nothing to your conscience.”“Hear the truth, then,” said the Templar; “I care not for your blue-eyed beauty. There is in that train one who will make me a bettermate.”“What! wouldst thou stoop to the waiting damsel?” said De Bracy.“No, Sir Knight,” said the Templar, haughtily. “To the waiting-woman will I not stoop. I have a prize among the captives as lovelyas thine own.”“By the mass, thou meanest the fair Jewess!” said De Bracy.“And if I do,” said Bois-Guilbert, “who shall gainsay me?”“No one that I know,” said De Bracy, “unless it be your vow of celibacy, or a check of conscience for an intrigue with a Jewess.”“For my vow,” said the Templar, “our Grand Master hath granted me a dispensation. And for my conscience, a man that has slainthree hundred Saracens, need not reckon up every little failing, like a village girl at her ﬁrst confession upon Good Friday eve.”“Thou knowest best thine own privileges,” said De Bracy. “Yet, I would have sworn thy thought had been more on the old usurer’smoney bags, than on the black eyes of the daughter.”“I can admire both,” answered the Templar; “besides, the old Jew is but half-prize. I must share his spoils with Front-de-Bœuf, whowill not lend us the use of his castle for nothing. I must have something that I can term exclusively my own by this foray of ours, and Ihave ﬁxed on the lovely Jewess as my peculiar prize. But, now thou knowest my drift, thou wilt resume thine own original plan, wiltthou not?—Thou hast nothing, thou seest, to fear from my interference.”“No,” replied De Bracy, “I will remain beside my prize. What thou sayst is passing true, but I like not the privileges acquired by thedispensation of the Grand Master, and the merit acquired by the slaughter of three hundred Saracens. You have too good a right to afree pardon, to render you very scrupulous about peccadilloes.”While this dialogue was proceeding, Cedric was endeavouring to wring out of those who guarded him an avowal of their characterand purpose. “You should be Englishmen,” said he; “and yet, sacred Heaven! you prey upon your countrymen as if you were veryNormans. You should be my neighbours, and, if so, my friends; for which of my English neighbours have reason to be otherwise? Itell ye, yeomen, that even those among ye who have been branded with outlawry have had from me protection; for I have pitied theirmiseries, and curst the oppression of their tyrannic nobles. What, then, would you have of me? or in what can this violence serve ye?—Ye are worse than brute beasts in your actions, and will you imitate them in their very dumbness?”It was in vain that Cedric expostulated with his guards, who had too many good reasons for their silence to be induced to break iteither by his wrath or his expostulations. They continued to hurry him along, travelling at a very rapid rate, until, at the end of anavenue of huge trees, arose Torquilstone, now the hoary and ancient castle of Reginald Front-de-Bœuf. It was a fortress of no greatsize, consisting of a donjon, or large and high square tower, surrounded by buildings of inferior height, which were encircled by aninner court-yard. Around the exterior wall was a deep moat, supplied with water from a neighbouring rivulet. Front-de-Bœuf, whosecharacter placed him often at feud with his enemies, had made considerable additions to the strength of his castle, by building towersupon the outward wall, so as to ﬂank it at every angle. The access, as usual in castles of the period, lay through an arched barbican, oroutwork, which was terminated and defended by a small turret at each corner.Cedric no sooner saw the turrets of Front-de-Bœuf’s castle raise their grey and moss-grown battlements, glimmering in the morningsun above the wood by which they were surrounded, than he instantly augured more truly concerning the cause of his misfortune.“I did injustice,” he said, “to the thieves and outlaws of these woods, when I supposed such banditti to belong to their bands; Imight as justly have confounded the foxes of these brakes with the ravening wolves of France. Tell me, dogs—is it my life or mywealth that your master aims at? Is it too much that two Saxons, myself and the noble Athelstane, should hold land in the countrywhich was once the patrimony of our race?—Put us then to death, and complete your tyranny by taking our lives, as you began withour liberties. If the Saxon Cedric cannot rescue England, he is willing to die for her. Tell your tyrannical master, I do only beseech himto dismiss the Lady Rowena in honour and safety. She is a woman, and he need not dread her; and with us will die all who dare ﬁghtin her cause.”The attendants remained as mute to this address as to the former, and they now stood before the gate of the castle. De Bracy windedhis horn three times, and the archers and cross-bow men, who had manned the wall upon seeing their approach, hastened to lower thedrawbridge, and admit them. The prisoners were compelled by their guards to alight, and were conducted to an apartment where ahasty repast was offered them, of which none but Athelstane felt any inclination to partake. Neither had the descendant of theConfessor much time to do justice to the good cheer placed before them, for their guards gave him and Cedric to understand that theywere to be imprisoned in a chamber apart from Rowena. Resistance was vain; and they were compelled to follow to a large room,which, rising on clumsy Saxon pillars, resembled those refectories and chapter-houses which may be still seen in the most ancientparts of our most ancient monasteries.The Lady Rowena was next separated from her train, and conducted, with courtesy, indeed, but still without consulting herinclination, to a distant apartment. The same alarming distinction was conferred on Rebecca, in spite of her father’s entreaties, whooffered even money, in this extremity of distress, that she might be permitted to abide with him. “Base unbeliever,” answered one ofhis guards, “when thou hast seen thy lair, thou wilt not wish thy daughter to partake it.” And, without farther discussion, the old Jewwas forcibly dragged off in a different direction from the other prisoners. The domestics, after being carefully searched and disarmed,were conﬁned in another part of the castle; and Rowena was refused even the comfort she might have derived from the attendance ofher handmaiden Elgitha.The apartment in which the Saxon chiefs were conﬁned, for to them we turn our ﬁrst attention, although at present used as a sort ofguard-room, had formerly been the great hall of the castle. It was now abandoned to meaner purposes, because the present lord, amongother additions to the convenience, security, and beauty of his baronial residence, had erected a new and noble hall, whose vaulted roofwas supported by lighter and more elegant pillars, and ﬁtted up with that higher degree of ornament, which the Normans had alreadyintroduced into architecture.Cedric paced the apartment, ﬁlled with indignant reﬂections on the past and on the present, while the apathy of his companionserved, instead of patience and philosophy, to defend him against every thing save the inconvenience of the present moment; and solittle did he feel even this last, that he was only from time to time roused to a reply by Cedric’s animated and impassioned appeal tohim.“Yes,” said Cedric, half speaking to himself, and half addressing himself to Athelstane, “it was in this very hall that my fatherfeasted with Torquil Wolfganger, when he entertained the valiant and unfortunate Harold, then advancing against the Norwegians, whohad united themselves to the rebel Tosti. It was in this hall that Harold returned the magnanimous answer to the ambassador of hisrebel brother. Oft have I heard my father kindle as he told the tale. The envoy of Tosti was admitted, when this ample room couldscarce contain the crowd of noble Saxon leaders, who were quafﬁng the blood-red wine around their monarch.”“I hope,” said Athelstane, somewhat moved by this part of his friend’s discourse, “they will not forget to send us some wine andrefactions at noon—we had scarce a breathing-space allowed to break our fast, and I never have the beneﬁt of my food when I eatimmediately after dismounting from horseback, though the leeches recommend that practice.”Cedric went on with his story without noticing this interjectional observation of his friend.“The envoy of Tosti,” he said, “moved up the hall, undismayed by the frowning countenances of all around him, until he made hisobeisance before the throne of King Harold.“‘What terms,’ he said, ‘Lord King, hath thy brother Tosti to hope, if he should lay down his arms, and crave peace at thy hands?’“‘A brother’s love,’ cried the generous Harold, ‘and the fair earldom of Northumberland.’“‘But should Tosti accept these terms,’ continued the envoy, ‘what lands shall be assigned to his faithful ally, Hardrada, King ofNorway?’“‘Seven feet of English ground,’ answered Harold, ﬁercely, ‘or, as Hardrada is said to be a giant, perhaps we may allow him twelveinches more.’“The hall rung with acclamations, and cup and horn was ﬁlled to the Norwegian, who should be speedily in possession of hisEnglish territory.”“I could have pledged him with all my soul,” said Athelstane, “for my tongue cleaves to my palate.”“The bafﬂed envoy,” continued Cedric, pursuing with animation his tale, though it interested not the listener, “retreated, to carry toTosti and his ally the ominous answer of his injured brother. It was then that the distant towers of York, and the bloody streams of theDerwent, 26 beheld that direful conﬂict, in which, after displaying the most undaunted valour, the King of Norway, and Tosti, both fell,with ten thousand of their bravest followers. Who would have thought that upon the proud day when this battle was won, the very galewhich waved the Saxon banners in triumph, was ﬁlling the Norman sails, and impelling them to the fatal shores of Sussex?—Whowould have thought that Harold, within a few brief days, would himself possess no more of his kingdom, than the share which heallotted in his wrath to the Norwegian invader?—Who would have thought that you, noble Athelstane—that you, descended ofHarold’s blood, and that I, whose father was not the worst defender of the Saxon crown, should be prisoners to a vile Norman, in thevery hall in which our ancestors held such high festival?”“It is sad enough,” replied Athelstane; “but I trust they will hold us to a moderate ransom—At any rate it cannot be their purpose tostarve us outright; and yet, although it is high noon, I see no preparations for serving dinner. Look up at the window, noble Cedric, andjudge by the sunbeams if it is not on the verge of noon.”“It may be so,” answered Cedric; “but I cannot look on that stained lattice without its awakening other reﬂections than those whichconcern the passing moment, or its privations. When that window was wrought, my noble friend, our hardy fathers knew not the art ofmaking glass, or of staining it—The pride of Wolfganger’s father brought an artist from Normandy to adorn his hall with this newspecies of emblazonment, that breaks the golden light of God’s blessed day into so many fantastic hues. The foreigner came here poor,beggarly, cringing, and subservient, ready to doff his cap to the meanest native of the household. He returned pampered and proud, totell his rapacious countrymen of the wealth and the simplicity of the Saxon nobles—a folly, oh, Athelstane, foreboded of old, as wellas foreseen, by those descendants of Hengist and his hardy tribes, who retained the simplicity of their manners. We made thesestrangers our bosom friends, our conﬁdential servants; we borrowed their artists and their arts, and despised the honest simplicity andhardihood with which our brave ancestors supported themselves, and we became enervated by Norman arts long ere we fell underNorman arms. Far better was our homely diet, eaten in peace and liberty, than the luxurious dainties, the love of which hath deliveredus as bondsmen to the foreign conqueror!”“I should,” replied Athelstane, “hold very humble diet a luxury at present; and it astonishes me, noble Cedric, that you can bear sotruly in mind the memory of past deeds, when it appeareth you forget the very hour of dinner.”“It is time lost,” muttered Cedric apart and impatiently, “to speak to him of aught else but that which concerns his appetite! The soulof Hardicanute hath taken possession of him, and he hath no pleasure save to ﬁll, to swill, and to call for more.—Alas!” said he,looking at Athelstane with compassion, “that so dull a spirit should be lodged in so goodly a form! Alas! that such an enterprise as theregeneration of England should turn on a hinge so imperfect! Wedded to Rowena, indeed, her nobler and more generous soul may yetawake the better nature which is torpid within him. Yet how should this be, while Rowena, Athelstane, and I myself, remain theprisoners of this brutal marauder and have been made so perhaps from a sense of the dangers which our liberty might bring to theusurped power of his nation?”While the Saxon was plunged in these painful reﬂections, the door of their prison opened, and gave entrance to a sewer, holding hiswhite rod of ofﬁce. This important person advanced into the chamber with a grave pace, followed by four attendants, bearing in a tablecovered with dishes, the sight and smell of which seemed to be an instant compensation to Athelstane for all the inconvenience he hadundergone. The persons who attended on the feast were masked and cloaked.“What mummery is this?” said Cedric; “think you that we are ignorant whose prisoners we are, when we are in the castle of yourmaster? Tell him,” he continued, willing to use this opportunity to open a negotiation for his freedom,—“Tell your master, ReginaldFront-de-Bœuf, that we know no reason he can have for withholding our liberty, excepting his unlawful desire to enrich himself at ourexpense. Tell him that we yield to his rapacity, as in similar circumstances we should do to that of a literal robber. Let him name theransom at which he rates our liberty, and it shall be paid, providing the exaction is suited to our means.” The sewer made no answer,but bowed his head.“And tell Sir Reginald Front-de-Bœuf,” said Athelstane, “that I send him my mortal deﬁance, and challenge him to combat with me,on foot or horseback, at any secure place, within eight days after our liberation; which, if he be a true knight, he will not, under thesecircumstances, venture to refuse or to delay.”“I shall deliver to the knight your deﬁance,” answered the sewer; “meanwhile I leave you to your food.”The challenge of Athelstane was delivered with no good grace; for a large mouthful, which required the exercise of both jaws atonce, added to a natural hesitation, considerably damped the effect of the bold deﬁance it contained. Still, however, his speech washailed by Cedric as an incontestible token of reviving spirit in his companion, whose previous indifference had begun, notwithstandinghis respect for Athelstane’s descent, to wear out his patience. But he now cordially shook hands with him in token of his approbation,and was somewhat grieved when Athelstane observed, “that he would ﬁght a dozen such men as Front-de-Bœuf, if, by so doing, hecould hasten his departure from a dungeon where they put so much garlic into their pottage.” Notwithstanding this intimation of arelapse into the apathy of sensuality, Cedric placed himself opposite to Athelstane, and soon showed, that if the distresses of hiscountry could banish the recollection of food while the table was uncovered, yet no sooner were the victuals put there, than he provedthat the appetite of his Saxon ancestors had descended to him along with their other qualities.The captives had not long enjoyed their refreshment, however, ere their attention was disturbed even from this most seriousoccupation by the blast of a horn winded before the gate. It was repeated three times, with as much violence as if it had been blownbefore an enchanted castle by the destined knight, at whose summons halls and towers, barbican and battlement, were to roll off like amorning vapour. The Saxons started from the table, and hastened to the window. But their curiosity was disappointed; for these outletsonly looked upon the court of the castle, and the sound came from beyond its precincts. The summons, however, seemed ofimportance, for a considerable degree of bustle instantly took place in the castle.CHAPTER XXIIMy daughter—O my ducats—O my daughter!———O my Christian ducats!Justice—the Law—my ducats, and my daughter!MERCHANT OF VENICELeaving the Saxon chiefs to return to their banquet as soon as their ungratiﬁed curiosity should permit them to attend to the calls oftheir half-satiated appetite, we have to look in upon the yet more severe imprisonment of Isaac of York. The poor Jew had been hastilythrust into a dungeon-vault of the castle, the ﬂoor of which was deep beneath the level of the ground, and very damp, being lower thaneven the moat itself. The only light was received through one or two loop-holes far above the reach of the captive’s hand. Theseapertures admitted, even at mid-day, only a dim and uncertain light, which was changed for utter darkness long before the rest of thecastle had lost the blessing of day. Chains and shackles, which had been the portion of former captives, from whom active exertions toescape had been apprehended, hung rusted and empty on the walls of the prison, and in the rings of one of those sets of fetters thereremained two mouldering bones, which seemed to have been once those of the human leg, as if some prisoner had been left not only toperish there, but to be consumed to a skeleton.At one end of this ghastly apartment was a large ﬁre-grate, over the top of which were stretched some transverse iron bars, halfdevoured with rust.The whole appearance of the dungeon might have appalled a stouter heart than that of Isaac, who, nevertheless, was more composedunder the imminent pressure of danger, than he had seemed to be while affected by terrors, of which the cause was as yet remote andcontingent. The lovers of the chase say that the hare feels more agony during the pursuit of the greyhounds, than when she isstruggling in their fangs. 27And thus it is probable, that the Jews, by the very frequency of their fear on all occasions, had their minds in some degree preparedfor every effort of tyranny which could be practised upon them; so that no aggression, when it had taken place, could bring with it thatsurprise which is the most disabling quality of terror. Neither was it the ﬁrst time that Isaac had been placed in circumstances sodangerous. He had therefore experience to guide him, as well as hope, that he might again, as formerly, be delivered as a prey from thefowler. Above all, he had upon his side the unyielding obstinacy of his nation, and that unbending resolution, with which Israeliteshave been frequently known to submit to the uttermost evils which power and violence can inﬂict upon them, rather than gratify theiroppressors by granting their demands.In this humour of passive resistance, and with his garment collected beneath him to keep his limbs from the wet pavement, Isaac satin a corner of his dungeon, where his folded hands, his dishevelled hair and beard, his furred cloak and high cap, seen by the wiry andbroken light, would have afforded a study for Rembrandt, had that celebrated painter existed at the period. The Jew remained, withoutaltering his position, for nearly three hours, at the expiry of which steps were heard on the dungeon stair. The bolts screamed as theywere withdrawn—the hinges creaked as the wicket opened, and Reginald Front-de-Bœuf, followed by the two Saracen slaves of theTemplar, entered the prison.Front-de-Bœuf, a tall and strong man, whose life had been spent in public war or in private feuds and broils, and who had hesitatedat no means of extending his feudal power, had features corresponding to his character, and which strongly expressed the ﬁercer andmore malignant passions of the mind. The scars with which his visage was seamed, would, on features of a different cast, have excitedthe sympathy and veneration due to the marks of honourable valour; but, in the peculiar case of Front-de-Bœuf, they only added to theferocity of his countenance, and to the dread which his presence inspired. This formidable baron was clad in a leathern doublet, ﬁttedclose to his body, which was frayed and soiled with the stains of his armour. He had no weapon, excepting a poniard at his belt, whichserved to counterbalance the weight of the bunch of rusty keys that hung at his right side.The black slaves who attended Front-de-Bœuf were stripped of their gorgeous apparel, and attired in jerkins and trowsers of coarselinen, their sleeves being tucked up above the elbow, like those of butchers when about to exercise their function in the slaughter-house. Each had in his hand a small pannier; and, when they entered the dungeon, they stopt at the door until Front-de-Bœuf himselfcarefully locked and double-locked it. Having taken this precaution, he advanced slowly up the apartment towards the Jew, uponwhom he kept his eye ﬁxed, as if he wished to paralyze him with his glance, as some animals are said to fascinate their prey. It seemedindeed as if the sullen and malignant eye of Front-de-Bœuf possessed some portion of that supposed power over his unfortunateprisoner. The Jew sat with his mouth agape, and his eyes ﬁxed on the savage baron with such earnestness of terror, that his frameseemed literally to shrink together, and to diminish in size while encountering the ﬁerce Norman’s ﬁxed and baleful gaze. Theunhappy Isaac was deprived not only of the power of rising to make the obeisance which his terror dictated, but he could not even doffhis cap, or utter any word of supplication; so strongly was he agitated by the conviction that tortures and death were impending overhim.On the other hand, the stately form of the Norman appeared to dilate in magnitude, like that of the eagle, which rufﬂes up itsplumage when about to pounce on its defenceless prey. He paused within three steps of the corner in which the unfortunate Jew hadnow, as it were, coiled himself up into the smallest possible space, and made a sign for one of the slaves to approach. The blacksatellite came forward accordingly, and, producing from his basket a large pair of scales and several weights, he laid them at the feetof Front-de-Bœuf, and again retired to the respectful distance, at which his companion had already taken his station.The motions of these men were slow and solemn, as if there impended over their souls some preconception of horror and of cruelty.Front-de-Bœuf himself opened the scene by thus addressing his ill-fated captive.“Most accursed dog of an accursed race,” he said, awaking with his deep and sullen voice the sullen echoes of his dungeon vault,“seest thou these scales?”The unhappy Jew returned a feeble afﬁrmative.“In these very scales shalt thou weigh me out,” said the relentless Baron, “a thousand silver pounds, after the just measure andweight of the Tower of London.”“Holy Abraham!” returned the Jew, ﬁnding voice through the very extremity of his danger, “heard man ever such a demand?—Whoever heard, even in a minstrel’s tale, of such a sum as a thousand pounds of silver?—What human sight was ever blessed with thevision of such a mass of treasure?—Not within the walls of York, ransack my house and that of all my tribe, wilt thou ﬁnd the tithe ofthat huge sum of silver that thou speakest of.”“I am reasonable,” answered Front-de-Bœuf, “and if silver be scant, I refuse not gold. At the rate of a mark of gold for each sixpounds of silver, thou shalt free thy unbelieving carcass from such punishment as thy heart has never even conceived.”“Have mercy on me, noble knight!” exclaimed Isaac; “I am old, and poor, and helpless. It were unworthy to triumph over me—It isa poor deed to crush a worm.”“Old thou mayst be,” replied the knight; “more shame to their folly who have suffered thee to grow grey in usury and knavery—Feeble thou mayst be, for when had a Jew either heart or hand—But rich it is well known thou art.”“I swear to you, noble knight,” said the Jew “by all which I believe, and by all which we believe in common—-”“Perjure not thyself,” said the Norman, interrupting him, “and let not thine obstinacy seal thy doom, until thou hast seen and wellconsidered the fate that awaits thee. Think not I speak to thee only to excite thy terror, and practise on the base cowardice thou hastderived from thy tribe. I swear to thee by that which thou dost NOT believe, by the gospel which our church teaches, and by the keyswhich are given her to bind and to loose, that my purpose is deep and peremptory. This dungeon is no place for triﬂing. Prisoners tenthousand times more distinguished than thou have died within these walls, and their fate hath never been known! But for thee isreserved a long and lingering death, to which theirs were luxury.”He again made a signal for the slaves to approach, and spoke to them apart, in their own language; for he also had been in Palestine,where perhaps, he had learnt his lesson of cruelty. The Saracens produced from their baskets a quantity of charcoal, a pair of bellows,and a ﬂask of oil. While the one struck a light with a ﬂint and steel, the other disposed the charcoal in the large rusty grate which wehave already mentioned, and exercised the bellows until the fuel came to a red glow.“Seest thou, Isaac,” said Front-de-Bœuf, “the range of iron bars above the glowing charcoal?— 28 on that warm couch thou shaltlie, stripped of thy clothes as if thou wert to rest on a bed of down. One of these slaves shall maintain the ﬁre beneath thee, while theother shall anoint thy wretched limbs with oil, lest the roast should burn.—Now, choose betwixt such a scorching bed and the paymentof a thousand pounds of silver; for, by the head of my father, thou hast no other option.”
“It is impossible,” exclaimed the miserable Jew—“it is impossible that your purpose can be real! The good God of nature nevermade a heart capable of exercising such cruelty!”“Trust not to that, Isaac,” said Front-de-Bœuf, “it were a fatal error. Dost thou think that I, who have seen a town sacked, in whichthousands of my Christian countrymen perished by sword, by ﬂood, and by ﬁre, will blench from my purpose for the outcries orscreams of one single wretched Jew?—or thinkest thou that these swarthy slaves, who have neither law, country, nor conscience, buttheir master’s will—who use the poison, or the stake, or the poniard, or the cord, at his slightest wink—thinkest thou that THEY willhave mercy, who do not even understand the language in which it is asked?—Be wise, old man; discharge thyself of a portion of thysuperﬂuous wealth; repay to the hands of a Christian a part of what thou hast acquired by the usury thou hast practised on those of hisreligion. Thy cunning may soon swell out once more thy shrivelled purse, but neither leech nor medicine can restore thy scorched hideand ﬂesh wert thou once stretched on these bars. Tell down thy ransom, I say, and rejoice that at such rate thou canst redeem thee froma dungeon, the secrets of which few have returned to tell. I waste no more words with thee—choose between thy dross and thy ﬂeshand blood, and as thou choosest, so shall it be.”“So may Abraham, Jacob, and all the fathers of our people assist me,” said Isaac, “I cannot make the choice, because I have not themeans of satisfying your exorbitant demand!”“Seize him and strip him, slaves,” said the knight, “and let the fathers of his race assist him if they can.”The assistants, taking their directions more from the Baron’s eye and his hand than his tongue, once more stepped forward, laidhands on the unfortunate Isaac, plucked him up from the ground, and, holding him between them, waited the hard-hearted Baron’sfarther signal. The unhappy Jew eyed their countenances and that of Front-de-Bœuf, in hope of discovering some symptoms ofrelenting; but that of the Baron exhibited the same cold, half-sullen, half-sarcastic smile which had been the prelude to his cruelty; andthe savage eyes of the Saracens, rolling gloomily under their dark brows, acquiring a yet more sinister expression by the whiteness ofthe circle which surrounds the pupil, evinced rather the secret pleasure which they expected from the approaching scene, than anyreluctance to be its directors or agents. The Jew then looked at the glowing furnace, over which he was presently to be stretched, andseeing no chance of his tormentor’s relenting, his resolution gave way.“I will pay,” he said, “the thousand pounds of silver—That is,” he added, after a moment’s pause, “I will pay it with the help of my“I will pay,” he said, “the thousand pounds of silver—That is,” he added, after a moment’s pause, “I will pay it with the help of mybrethren; for I must beg as a mendicant at the door of our synagogue ere I make up so unheard-of a sum.—When and where must it bedelivered?”“Here,” replied Front-de-Bœuf, “here it must be delivered—weighed it must be—weighed and told down on this very dungeonﬂoor.—Thinkest thou I will part with thee until thy ransom is secure?”“And what is to be my surety,” said the Jew, “that I shall be at liberty after this ransom is paid?”“The word of a Norman noble, thou pawn-broking slave,” answered Front-de-Bœuf; “the faith of a Norman nobleman, more purethan the gold and silver of thee and all thy tribe.”“I crave pardon, noble lord,” said Isaac timidly, “but wherefore should I rely wholly on the word of one who will trust nothing tomine?”“Because thou canst not help it, Jew,” said the knight, sternly. “Wert thou now in thy treasure-chamber at York, and were I craving aloan of thy shekels, it would be thine to dictate the time of payment, and the pledge of security. This is MY treasure-chamber. Here Ihave thee at advantage, nor will I again deign to repeat the terms on which I grant thee liberty.”The Jew groaned deeply.—“Grant me,” he said, “at least with my own liberty, that of the companions with whom I travel. Theyscorned me as a Jew, yet they pitied my desolation, and because they tarried to aid me by the way, a share of my evil hath come uponthem; moreover, they may contribute in some sort to my ransom.”“If thou meanest yonder Saxon churls,” said Front-de-Bœuf, “their ransom will depend upon other terms than thine. Mind thine ownconcerns, Jew, I warn thee, and meddle not with those of others.”“I am, then,” said Isaac, “only to be set at liberty, together with mine wounded friend?”“Shall I twice recommend it,” said Front-de-Bœuf, “to a son of Israel, to meddle with his own concerns, and leave those of othersalone?—Since thou hast made thy choice, it remains but that thou payest down thy ransom, and that at a short day.”“Yet hear me,” said the Jew—“for the sake of that very wealth which thou wouldst obtain at the expense of thy—-” Here he stoptshort, afraid of irritating the savage Norman. But Front-de-Bœuf only laughed, and himself ﬁlled up the blank at which the Jew hadhesitated.“At the expense of my conscience, thou wouldst say, Isaac; speak it out—I tell thee, I am reasonable. I can bear the reproaches of aloser, even when that loser is a Jew. Thou wert not so patient, Isaac, when thou didst invoke justice against Jacques Fitzdotterel, forcalling thee a usurious blood-sucker, when thy exactions had devoured his patrimony.”“I swear by the Talmud,” said the Jew, “that your valour has been misled in that matter. Fitzdotterel drew his poniard upon me inmine own chamber, because I craved him for mine own silver. The term of payment was due at the Passover.”“I care not what he did,” said Front-de-Bœuf; “the question is, when shall I have mine own?—when shall I have the shekels,Isaac?”“Let my daughter Rebecca go forth to York,” answered Isaac, “with your safe conduct, noble knight, and so soon as man and horsecan return, the treasure—-” Here he groaned deeply, but added, after the pause of a few seconds,—“The treasure shall be told down onthis very ﬂoor.”“Thy daughter!” said Front-de-Bœuf, as if surprised,—“By heavens, Isaac, I would I had known of this. I deemed that yonderblack-browed girl had been thy concubine, and I gave her to be a handmaiden to Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert, after the fashion ofpatriarchs and heroes of the days of old, who set us in these matters a wholesome example.”The yell which Isaac raised at this unfeeling communication made the very vault to ring, and astounded the two Saracens so muchthat they let go their hold of the Jew. He availed himself of his enlargement to throw himself on the pavement, and clasp the knees ofFront-de-Bœuf.“Take all that you have asked,” said he, “Sir Knight—take ten times more—reduce me to ruin and to beggary, if thou wilt,—nay,pierce me with thy poniard, broil me on that furnace, but spare my daughter, deliver her in safety and honour!—As thou art born ofwoman, spare the honour of a helpless maiden—She is the image of my deceased Rachel, she is the last of six pledges of her love—Will you deprive a widowed husband of his sole remaining comfort?—Will you reduce a father to wish that his only living child werelaid beside her dead mother, in the tomb of our fathers?”“I would,” said the Norman, somewhat relenting, “that I had known of this before. I thought your race had loved nothing save theirmoneybags.”“Think not so vilely of us, Jews though we be,” said Isaac, eager to improve the moment of apparent sympathy; “the hunted fox, thetortured wildcat loves its young—the despised and persecuted race of Abraham love their children!”“Be it so,” said Front-de-Bœuf; “I will believe it in future, Isaac, for thy very sake—but it aids us not now, I cannot help what hashappened, or what is to follow; my word is passed to my comrade in arms, nor would I break it for ten Jews and Jewesses to boot.Besides, why shouldst thou think evil is to come to the girl, even if she became Bois-Guilbert’s booty?”“There will, there must!” exclaimed Isaac, wringing his hands in agony; “when did Templars breathe aught but cruelty to men, anddishonour to women!”“Dog of an inﬁdel,” said Front-de-Bœuf, with sparkling eyes, and not sorry, perhaps, to seize a pretext for working himself into apassion, “blaspheme not the Holy Order of the Temple of Zion, but take thought instead to pay me the ransom thou hast promised, orwoe betide thy Jewish throat!”“Robber and villain!” said the Jew, retorting the insults of his oppressor with passion, which, however impotent, he now found itimpossible to bridle, “I will pay thee nothing—not one silver penny will I pay thee, unless my daughter is delivered to me in safetyand honour!”“Art thou in thy senses, Israelite?” said the Norman, sternly—“has thy ﬂesh and blood a charm against heated iron and scaldingoil?”“I care not!” said the Jew, rendered desperate by paternal affection; “do thy worst. My daughter is my ﬂesh and blood, dearer to mea thousand times than those limbs which thy cruelty threatens. No silver will I give thee, unless I were to pour it molten down thyavaricious throat—no, not a silver penny will I give thee, Nazarene, were it to save thee from the deep damnation thy whole life hasmerited! Take my life if thou wilt, and say, the Jew, amidst his tortures, knew how to disappoint the Christian.”“We shall see that,” said Front-de-Bœuf; “for by the blessed rood, which is the abomination of thy accursed tribe, thou shalt feel theextremities of ﬁre and steel!—Strip him, slaves, and chain him down upon the bars.”In spite of the feeble struggles of the old man, the Saracens had already torn from him his upper garment, and were proceedingtotally to disrobe him, when the sound of a bugle, twice winded without the castle, penetrated even to the recesses of the dungeon, andimmediately after loud voices were heard calling for Sir Reginald Front-de-Bœuf. Unwilling to be found engaged in his hellishoccupation, the savage Baron gave the slaves a signal to restore Isaac’s garment, and, quitting the dungeon with his attendants, he leftthe Jew to thank God for his own deliverance, or to lament over his daughter’s captivity, and probable fate, as his personal or parentalfeelings might prove strongest.CHAPTER XXIIINay, if the gentle spirit of moving wordsCan no way change you to a milder form,I’ll woo you, like a soldier, at arms’ end,And love you ’gainst the nature of love, force you.TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONAThe apartment to which the Lady Rowena had been introduced was ﬁtted up with some rude attempts at ornament andmagniﬁcence, and her being placed there might be considered as a peculiar mark of respect not offered to the other prisoners. But thewife of Front-de-Bœuf, for whom it had been originally furnished, was long dead, and decay and neglect had impaired the fewornaments with which her taste had adorned it. The tapestry hung down from the walls in many places, and in others was tarnishedand faded under the effects of the sun, or tattered and decayed by age. Desolate, however, as it was, this was the apartment of thecastle which had been judged most ﬁtting for the accommodation of the Saxon heiress; and here she was left to meditate upon her fate,until the actors in this nefarious drama had arranged the several parts which each of them was to perform. This had been settled in acouncil held by Front-de-Bœuf, De Bracy, and the Templar, in which, after a long and warm debate concerning the several advantageswhich each insisted upon deriving from his peculiar share in this audacious enterprise, they had at length determined the fate of theirunhappy prisoners.It was about the hour of noon, therefore, when De Bracy, for whose advantage the expedition had been ﬁrst planned, appeared toprosecute his views upon the hand and possessions of the Lady Rowena.The interval had not entirely been bestowed in holding council with his confederates, for De Bracy had found leisure to decorate hisperson with all the foppery of the times. His green cassock and vizard were now ﬂung aside. His long luxuriant hair was trained toﬂow in quaint tresses down his richly furred cloak. His beard was closely shaved, his doublet reached to the middle of his leg, and thegirdle which secured it, and at the same time supported his ponderous sword, was embroidered and embossed with gold work. Wehave already noticed the extravagant fashion of the shoes at this period, and the points of Maurice de Bracy’s might have challengedthe prize of extravagance with the gayest, being turned up and twisted like the horns of a ram. Such was the dress of a gallant of theperiod; and, in the present instance, that effect was aided by the handsome person and good demeanour of the wearer, whose mannerspartook alike of the grace of a courtier, and the frankness of a soldier.He saluted Rowena by dofﬁng his velvet bonnet, garnished with a golden broach, representing St Michael trampling down thePrince of Evil. With this, he gently motioned the lady to a seat; and, as she still retained her standing posture, the knight ungloved hisright hand, and motioned to conduct her thither. But Rowena declined, by her gesture, the proffered compliment, and replied, “If I bein the presence of my jailor, Sir Knight—nor will circumstances allow me to think otherwise—it best becomes his prisoner to remainstanding till she learns her doom.”“Alas! fair Rowena,” returned De Bracy, “you are in presence of your captive, not your jailor; and it is from your fair eyes that DeBracy must receive that doom which you fondly expect from him.”“I know you not, sir,” said the lady, drawing herself up with all the pride of offended rank and beauty; “I know you not—and theinsolent familiarity with which you apply to me the jargon of a troubadour, forms no apology for the violence of a robber.”“To thyself, fair maid,” answered De Bracy, in his former tone—“to thine own charms be ascribed whate’er I have done whichpassed the respect due to her, whom I have chosen queen of my heart, and lodestar of my eyes.”“I repeat to you, Sir Knight, that I know you not, and that no man wearing chain and spurs ought thus to intrude himself upon thepresence of an unprotected lady.”“That I am unknown to you,” said De Bracy, “is indeed my misfortune; yet let me hope that De Bracy’s name has not been alwaysunspoken, when minstrels or heralds have praised deeds of chivalry, whether in the lists or in the battle-ﬁeld.”“To heralds and to minstrels, then, leave thy praise, Sir Knight,” replied Rowena, “more suiting for their mouths than for thine own;and tell me which of them shall record in song, or in book of tourney, the memorable conquest of this night, a conquest obtained overan old man, followed by a few timid hinds; and its booty, an unfortunate maiden, transported against her will to the castle of arobber?”“You are unjust, Lady Rowena,” said the knight, biting his lips in some confusion, and speaking in a tone more natural to him thanthat of affected gallantry, which he had at ﬁrst adopted; “yourself free from passion, you can allow no excuse for the frenzy of another,although caused by your own beauty.”“I pray you, Sir Knight,” said Rowena, “to cease a language so commonly used by strolling minstrels, that it becomes not the mouthof knights or nobles. Certes, you constrain me to sit down, since you enter upon such commonplace terms, of which each vile crowderhath a stock that might last from hence to Christmas.”“Proud damsel,” said De Bracy, incensed at ﬁnding his gallant style procured him nothing but contempt—“proud damsel, thou shaltbe as proudly encountered. Know then, that I have supported my pretensions to your hand in the way that best suited thy character. Itis meeter for thy humour to be wooed with bow and bill, than in set terms, and in courtly language.”“Courtesy of tongue,” said Rowena, “when it is used to veil churlishness of deed, is but a knight’s girdle around the breast of a baseclown. I wonder not that the restraint appears to gall you—more it were for your honour to have retained the dress and language of anoutlaw, than to veil the deeds of one under an affectation of gentle language and demeanour.”“You counsel well, lady,” said the Norman; “and in the bold language which best justiﬁes bold action I tell thee, thou shalt neverleave this castle, or thou shalt leave it as Maurice de Bracy’s wife. I am not wont to be bafﬂed in my enterprises, nor needs a Normannoble scrupulously to vindicate his conduct to the Saxon maiden whom he distinguishes by the offer of his hand. Thou art proud,Rowena, and thou art the ﬁtter to be my wife. By what other means couldst thou be raised to high honour and to princely place, savingby my alliance? How else wouldst thou escape from the mean precincts of a country grange, where Saxons herd with the swine whichform their wealth, to take thy seat, honoured as thou shouldst be, and shalt be, amid all in England that is distinguished by beauty, ordigniﬁed by power?”“Sir Knight,” replied Rowena, “the grange which you contemn hath been my shelter from infancy; and, trust me, when I leave it—should that day ever arrive—it shall be with one who has not learnt to despise the dwelling and manners in which I have been broughtup.”“I guess your meaning, lady,” said De Bracy, “though you may think it lies too obscure for my apprehension. But dream not, thatRichard Cœur de Lion will ever resume his throne, far less that Wilfred of Ivanhoe, his minion, will ever lead thee to his footstool, tobe there welcomed as the bride of a favourite. Another suitor might feel jealousy while he touched this string; but my ﬁrm purposecannot be changed by a passion so childish and so hopeless. Know, lady, that this rival is in my power, and that it rests but with me tobetray the secret of his being within the castle to Front-de-Bœuf, whose jealousy will be more fatal than mine.”“Wilfred here?” said Rowena, in disdain; “that is as true as that Front-de-Bœuf is his rival.”De Bracy looked at her steadily for an instant.“Wert thou really ignorant of this?” said he; “didst thou not know that Wilfred of Ivanhoe travelled in the litter of the Jew?—a meetconveyance for the crusader, whose doughty arm was to reconquer the Holy Sepulchre!” And he laughed scornfully.“And if he is here,” said Rowena, compelling herself to a tone of indifference, though trembling with an agony of apprehensionwhich she could not suppress, “in what is he the rival of Front-de-Bœuf? or what has he to fear beyond a short imprisonment, and anhonourable ransom, according to the use of chivalry?”“Rowena,” said De Bracy, “art thou, too, deceived by the common error of thy sex, who think there can be no rivalry but thatrespecting their own charms? Knowest thou not there is a jealousy of ambition and of wealth, as well as of love; and that this our host,Front-de-Bœuf, will push from his road him who opposes his claim to the fair barony of Ivanhoe, as readily, eagerly, andunscrupulously, as if he were preferred to him by some blue-eyed damsel? But smile on my suit, lady, and the wounded championshall have nothing to fear from Front-de-Bœuf, whom else thou mayst mourn for, as in the hands of one who has never showncompassion.”“Save him, for the love of Heaven!” said Rowena, her ﬁrmness giving way under terror for her lover’s impending fate.“I can—I will—it is my purpose,” said De Bracy; “for, when Rowena consents to be the bride of De Bracy, who is it shall dare toput forth a violent hand upon her kinsman—the son of her guardian—the companion of her youth? But it is thy love must buy hisprotection. I am not romantic fool enough to further the fortune, or avert the fate, of one who is likely to be a successful obstaclebetween me and my wishes. Use thine inﬂuence with me in his behalf, and he is safe,—refuse to employ it, Wilfred dies, and thouthyself art not the nearer to freedom.”“Thy language,” answered Rowena, “hath in its indifferent bluntness something which cannot be reconciled with the horrors itseems to express. I believe not that thy purpose is so wicked, or thy power so great.”“Flatter thyself, then, with that belief,” said De Bracy, “until time shall prove it false. Thy lover lies wounded in this castle—thypreferred lover. He is a bar betwixt Front-de-Bœuf and that which Front-de-Bœuf loves better than either ambition or beauty. Whatwill it cost beyond the blow of a poniard, or the thrust of a javelin, to silence his opposition for ever? Nay, were Front-de-Bœuf afraidto justify a deed so open, let the leech but give his patient a wrong draught—let the chamberlain, or the nurse who tends him, butpluck the pillow from his head, and Wilfred in his present condition, is sped without the effusion of blood. Cedric also—”“And Cedric also,” said Rowena, repeating his words; “my noble—my generous guardian! I deserved the evil I have encountered,for forgetting his fate even in that of his son!”“Cedric’s fate also depends upon thy determination,” said De Bracy; “and I leave thee to form it.”Hitherto, Rowena had sustained her part in this trying scene with undismayed courage, but it was because she had not consideredthe danger as serious and imminent. Her disposition was naturally that which physiognomists consider as proper to fair complexions,mild, timid, and gentle; but it had been tempered, and, as it were, hardened, by the circumstances of her education. Accustomed to seethe will of all, even of Cedric himself, (sufﬁciently arbitrary with others,) give way before her wishes, she had acquired that sort ofcourage and self-conﬁdence which arises from the habitual and constant deference of the circle in which we move. She could scarceconceive the possibility of her will being opposed, far less that of its being treated with total disregard.Her haughtiness and habit of domination was, therefore, a ﬁctitious character, induced over that which was natural to her, and itdeserted her when her eyes were opened to the extent of her own danger, as well as that of her lover and her guardian; and when shefound her will, the slightest expression of which was wont to command respect and attention, now placed in opposition to that of aman of a strong, ﬁerce, and determined mind, who possessed the advantage over her, and was resolved to use it, she quailed beforehim.After casting her eyes around, as if to look for the aid which was nowhere to be found, and after a few broken interjections, sheraised her hands to heaven, and burst into a passion of uncontrolled vexation and sorrow. It was impossible to see so beautiful acreature in such extremity without feeling for her, and De Bracy was not unmoved, though he was yet more embarrassed than touched.He had, in truth, gone too far to recede; and yet, in Rowena’s present condition, she could not be acted on either by argument orthreats. He paced the apartment to and fro, now vainly exhorting the terriﬁed maiden to compose herself, now hesitating concerninghis own line of conduct.If, thought he, I should be moved by the tears and sorrow of this disconsolate damsel, what should I reap but the loss of these fairhopes for which I have encountered so much risk, and the ridicule of Prince John and his jovial comrades? “And yet,” he said tohimself, “I feel myself ill framed for the part which I am playing. I cannot look on so fair a face while it is disturbed with agony, or onthose eyes when they are drowned in tears. I would she had retained her original haughtiness of disposition, or that I had a larger shareof Front-de-Bœuf’s thrice-tempered hardness of heart!”Agitated by these thoughts, he could only bid the unfortunate Rowena be comforted, and assure her, that as yet she had no reasonfor the excess of despair to which she was now giving way. But in this task of consolation De Bracy was interrupted by the horn,“hoarse-winded blowing far and keen,” which had at the same time alarmed the other inmates of the castle, and interrupted theirseveral plans of avarice and of license. Of them all, perhaps, De Bracy least regretted the interruption; for his conference with theLady Rowena had arrived at a point, where he found it equally difﬁcult to prosecute or to resign his enterprise.And here we cannot but think it necessary to offer some better proof than the incidents of an idle tale, to vindicate the melancholyrepresentation of manners which has been just laid before the reader. It is grievous to think that those valiant barons, to whose standagainst the crown the liberties of England were indebted for their existence, should themselves have been such dreadful oppressors,and capable of excesses contrary not only to the laws of England, but to those of nature and humanity. But, alas! we have only toextract from the industrious Henry one of those numerous passages which he has collected from contemporary historians, to prove thatﬁction itself can hardly reach the dark reality of the horrors of the period.The description given by the author of the Saxon Chronicle of the cruelties exercised in the reign of King Stephen by the greatbarons and lords of castles, who were all Normans, affords a strong proof of the excesses of which they were capable when theirpassions were inﬂamed. “They grievously oppressed the poor people by building castles; and when they were built, they ﬁlled themwith wicked men, or rather devils, who seized both men and women who they imagined had any money, threw them into prison, andput them to more cruel tortures than the martyrs ever endured. They suffocated some in mud, and suspended others by the feet, or thehead, or the thumbs, kindling ﬁres below them. They squeezed the heads of some with knotted cords till they pierced their brains,while they threw others into dungeons swarming with serpents, snakes, and toads.” But it would be cruel to put the reader to the painof perusing the remainder of this description. 29As another instance of these bitter fruits of conquest, and perhaps the strongest that can be quoted, we may mention, that thePrincess Matilda, though a daughter of the King of Scotland, and afterwards both Queen of England, niece to Edgar Atheling, andmother to the Empress of Germany, the daughter, the wife, and the mother of monarchs, was obliged, during her early residence foreducation in England, to assume the veil of a nun, as the only means of escaping the licentious pursuit of the Norman nobles. Thisexcuse she stated before a great council of the clergy of England, as the sole reason for her having taken the religious habit. Theassembled clergy admitted the validity of the plea, and the notoriety of the circumstances upon which it was founded; giving thus anindubitable and most remarkable testimony to the existence of that disgraceful license by which that age was stained. It was a matterof public knowledge, they said, that after the conquest of King William, his Norman followers, elated by so great a victory,acknowledged no law but their own wicked pleasure, and not only despoiled the conquered Saxons of their lands and their goods, butinvaded the honour of their wives and of their daughters with the most unbridled license; and hence it was then common for matronsand maidens of noble families to assume the veil, and take shelter in convents, not as called thither by the vocation of God, but solelyto preserve their honour from the unbridled wickedness of man.Such and so licentious were the times, as announced by the public declaration of the assembled clergy, recorded by Eadmer; and weneed add nothing more to vindicate the probability of the scenes which we have detailed, and are about to detail, upon the moreapocryphal authority of the Wardour MS.CHAPTER XXIVI’ll woo her as the lion woos his bride.DOUGLASWhile the scenes we have described were passing in other parts of the castle, the Jewess Rebecca awaited her fate in a distant andsequestered turret. Hither she had been led by two of her disguised ravishers, and on being thrust into the little cell, she found herselfin the presence of an old sibyl, who kept murmuring to herself a Saxon rhyme, as if to beat time to the revolving dance which herspindle was performing upon the ﬂoor. The hag raised her head as Rebecca entered, and scowled at the fair Jewess with the malignantenvy with which old age and ugliness, when united with evil conditions, are apt to look upon youth and beauty.“Thou must up and away, old house-cricket,” said one of the men; “our noble master commands it—Thou must e’en leave thischamber to a fairer guest.”“Ay,” grumbled the hag, “even thus is service requited. I have known when my bare word would have cast the best man-at-armsamong ye out of saddle and out of service; and now must I up and away at the command of every groom such as thou.”“Good Dame Urfried,” said the other man, “stand not to reason on it, but up and away. Lords’ hests must be listened to with a quickear. Thou hast had thy day, old dame, but thy sun has long been set. Thou art now the very emblem of an old war-horse turned out onthe barren heath—thou hast had thy paces in thy time, but now a broken amble is the best of them—Come, amble off with thee.”“Ill omens dog ye both!” said the old woman; “and a kennel be your burying-place! May the evil demon Zernebock tear me limbfrom limb, if I leave my own cell ere I have spun out the hemp on my distaff!”“Answer it to our lord, then, old houseﬁend,” said the man, and retired; leaving Rebecca in company with the old woman, uponwhose presence she had been thus unwillingly forced.“What devil’s deed have they now in the wind?” said the old hag, murmuring to herself, yet from time to time casting a sidelongand malignant glance at Rebecca; “but it is easy to guess—Bright eyes, black locks, and a skin like paper, ere the priest stains it withhis black unguent—Ay, it is easy to guess why they send her to this lone turret, whence a shriek could no more be heard than at thedepth of ﬁve hundred fathoms beneath the earth.—Thou wilt have owls for thy neighbours, fair one; and their screams will be heard asfar, and as much regarded, as thine own. Outlandish, too,” she said, marking the dress and turban of Rebecca—“What country art thouof?—a Saracen? or an Egyptian?—Why dost not answer?—thou canst weep, canst thou not speak?”“Be not angry, good mother,” said Rebecca.“Thou needst say no more,” replied Urfried “men know a fox by the train, and a Jewess by her tongue.”“For the sake of mercy,” said Rebecca, “tell me what I am to expect as the conclusion of the violence which hath dragged me hither!Is it my life they seek, to atone for my religion? I will lay it down cheerfully.”“Thy life, minion?” answered the sibyl; “what would taking thy life pleasure them?—Trust me, thy life is in no peril. Such usageshalt thou have as was once thought good enough for a noble Saxon maiden. And shall a Jewess, like thee, repine because she hath nobetter? Look at me—I was as young and twice as fair as thou, when Front-de-Bœuf, father of this Reginald, and his Normans, stormedthis castle. My father and his seven sons defended their inheritance from story to story, from chamber to chamber—There was not aroom, not a step of the stair, that was not slippery with their blood. They died—they died every man; and ere their bodies were cold,and ere their blood was dried, I had become the prey and the scorn of the conqueror!”“Is there no help?—Are there no means of escape?” said Rebecca—“Richly, richly would I requite thine aid.”“Think not of it,” said the hag; “from hence there is no escape but through the gates of death; and it is late, late,” she added, shakingher grey head, “ere these open to us—Yet it is comfort to think that we leave behind us on earth those who shall be wretched asourselves. Fare thee well, Jewess!—Jew or Gentile, thy fate would be the same; for thou hast to do with them that have neither scruplenor pity. Fare thee well, I say. My thread is spun out—thy task is yet to begin.”“Stay! stay! for Heaven’s sake!” said Rebecca; “stay, though it be to curse and to revile me—thy presence is yet some protection.”“The presence of the mother of God were no protection,” answered the old woman. “There she stands,” pointing to a rude image ofthe Virgin Mary, “see if she can avert the fate that awaits thee.”She left the room as she spoke, her features writhed into a sort of sneering laugh, which made them seem even more hideous thantheir habitual frown. She locked the door behind her, and Rebecca might hear her curse every step for its steepness, as slowly and withdifﬁculty she descended the turret-stair.Rebecca was now to expect a fate even more dreadful than that of Rowena; for what probability was there that either softness orceremony would be used towards one of her oppressed race, whatever shadow of these might be preserved towards a Saxon heiress?Yet had the Jewess this advantage, that she was better prepared by habits of thought, and by natural strength of mind, to encounter thedangers to which she was exposed. Of a strong and observing character, even from her earliest years, the pomp and wealth which herfather displayed within his walls, or which she witnessed in the houses of other wealthy Hebrews, had not been able to blind her to theprecarious circumstances under which they were enjoyed. Like Damocles at his celebrated banquet, Rebecca perpetually beheld, amidthat gorgeous display, the sword which was suspended over the heads of her people by a single hair. These reﬂections had tamed andbrought down to a pitch of sounder judgment a temper, which, under other circumstances, might have waxed haughty, supercilious,and obstinate.From her father’s example and injunctions, Rebecca had learnt to bear herself courteously towards all who approached her. Shecould not indeed imitate his excess of subservience, because she was a stranger to the meanness of mind, and to the constant state oftimid apprehension, by which it was dictated; but she bore herself with a proud humility, as if submitting to the evil circumstances inwhich she was placed as the daughter of a despised race, while she felt in her mind the consciousness that she was entitled to hold ahigher rank from her merit, than the arbitrary despotism of religious prejudice permitted her to aspire to.Thus prepared to expect adverse circumstances, she had acquired the ﬁrmness necessary for acting under them. Her presentsituation required all her presence of mind, and she summoned it up accordingly.Her ﬁrst care was to inspect the apartment; but it afforded few hopes either of escape or protection. It contained neither secretpassage nor trap-door, and unless where the door by which she had entered joined the main building, seemed to be circumscribed bythe round exterior wall of the turret. The door had no inside bolt or bar. The single window opened upon an embattled spacesurmounting the turret, which gave Rebecca, at ﬁrst sight, some hopes of escaping; but she soon found it had no communication withany other part of the battlements, being an isolated bartisan, or balcony, secured, as usual, by a parapet, with embrasures, at which afew archers might be stationed for defending the turret, and ﬂanking with their shot the wall of the castle on that side.There was therefore no hope but in passive fortitude, and in that strong reliance on Heaven natural to great and generous characters.Rebecca, however erroneously taught to interpret the promises of Scripture to the chosen people of Heaven, did not err in supposingthe present to be their hour of trial, or in trusting that the children of Zion would be one day called in with the fulness of the Gentiles.In the meanwhile, all around her showed that their present state was that of punishment and probation, and that it was their especialduty to suffer without sinning. Thus prepared to consider herself as the victim of misfortune, Rebecca had early reﬂected upon herown state, and schooled her mind to meet the dangers which she had probably to encounter.The prisoner trembled, however, and changed colour, when a step was heard on the stair, and the door of the turret-chamber slowlyopened, and a tall man, dressed as one of those banditti to whom they owed their misfortune, slowly entered, and shut the door behindhim; his cap, pulled down upon his brows, concealed the upper part of his face, and he held his mantle in such a manner as to mufﬂethe rest. In this guise, as if prepared for the execution of some deed, at the thought of which he was himself ashamed, he stood beforethe affrighted prisoner; yet, rufﬁan as his dress bespoke him, he seemed at a loss to express what purpose had brought him thither, sothat Rebecca, making an effort upon herself, had time to anticipate his explanation. She had already unclasped two costly bracelets anda collar, which she hastened to proffer to the supposed outlaw, concluding naturally that to gratify his avarice was to bespeak hisfavour.“Take these,” she said, “good friend, and for God’s sake be merciful to me and my aged father! These ornaments are of value, yetare they triﬂing to what he would bestow to obtain our dismissal from this castle, free and uninjured.”“Fair ﬂower of Palestine,” replied the outlaw, “these pearls are orient, but they yield in whiteness to your teeth; the diamonds arebrilliant, but they cannot match your eyes; and ever since I have taken up this wild trade, I have made a vow to prefer beauty towealth.”“Do not do yourself such wrong,” said Rebecca; “take ransom, and have mercy!—Gold will purchase you pleasure,—to misuse us,could only bring thee remorse. My father will willingly satiate thy utmost wishes; and if thou wilt act wisely, thou mayst purchasewith our spoils thy restoration to civil society—mayst obtain pardon for past errors, and be placed beyond the necessity of committingmore.”“It is well spoken,” replied the outlaw in French, ﬁnding it difﬁcult probably to sustain, in Saxon, a conversation which Rebeccahad opened in that language; “but know, bright lily of the vale of Baca! that thy father is already in the hands of a powerful alchemist,who knows how to convert into gold and silver even the rusty bars of a dungeon grate. The venerable Isaac is subjected to an alembic,which will distil from him all he holds dear, without any assistance from my requests or thy entreaty. The ransom must be paid by loveand beauty, and in no other coin will I accept it.”“Thou art no outlaw,” said Rebecca, in the same language in which he addressed her; “no outlaw had refused such offers. No outlawin this land uses the dialect in which thou hast spoken. Thou art no outlaw, but a Norman—a Norman, noble perhaps in birth—O, beso in thy actions, and cast off this fearful mask of outrage and violence!”“And thou, who canst guess so truly,” said Brian de Bois-Guilbert, dropping the mantle from his face, “art no true daughter ofIsrael, but in all, save youth and beauty, a very witch of Endor. I am not an outlaw, then, fair rose of Sharon. And I am one who will bemore prompt to hang thy neck and arms with pearls and diamonds, which so well become them, than to deprive thee of theseornaments.”“What wouldst thou have of me,” said Rebecca, “if not my wealth?—We can have nought in common between us—you are aChristian—I am a Jewess.—Our union were contrary to the laws, alike of the church and the synagogue.”“It were so, indeed,” replied the Templar, laughing; “wed with a Jewess? ‘Despardieux!’—Not if she were the Queen of Sheba! Andknow, besides, sweet daughter of Zion, that were the most Christian king to offer me his most Christian daughter, with Languedoc fora dowery, I could not wed her. It is against my vow to love any maiden, otherwise than ‘par amours’, as I will love thee. I am aTemplar. Behold the cross of my Holy Order.”“Darest thou appeal to it,” said Rebecca, “on an occasion like the present?”“And if I do so,” said the Templar, “it concerns not thee, who art no believer in the blessed sign of our salvation.”“I believe as my fathers taught,” said Rebecca; “and may God forgive my belief if erroneous! But you, Sir Knight, what is yours,when you appeal without scruple to that which you deem most holy, even while you are about to transgress the most solemn of yourvows as a knight, and as a man of religion?”“It is gravely and well preached, O daughter of Sirach!” answered the Templar; “but, gentle Ecclesiastics, thy narrow Jewishprejudices make thee blind to our high privilege. Marriage were an enduring crime on the part of a Templar; but what lesser folly Imay practise, I shall speedily be absolved from at the next Preceptory of our Order. Not the wisest of monarchs, not his father, whoseexamples you must needs allow are weighty, claimed wider privileges than we poor soldiers of the Temple of Zion have won by ourzeal in its defence. The protectors of Solomon’s Temple may claim license by the example of Solomon.”“If thou readest the Scripture,” said the Jewess, “and the lives of the saints, only to justify thine own license and proﬂigacy, thycrime is like that of him who extracts poison from the most healthful and necessary herbs.”The eyes of the Templar ﬂashed ﬁre at this reproof—“Hearken,” he said, “Rebecca; I have hitherto spoken mildly to thee, but nowmy language shall be that of a conqueror. Thou art the captive of my bow and spear—subject to my will by the laws of all nations; norwill I abate an inch of my right, or abstain from taking by violence what thou refusest to entreaty or necessity.”“Stand back,” said Rebecca—“stand back, and hear me ere thou offerest to commit a sin so deadly! My strength thou mayst indeedoverpower for God made women weak, and trusted their defence to man’s generosity. But I will proclaim thy villainy, Templar, fromone end of Europe to the other. I will owe to the superstition of thy brethren what their compassion might refuse me, Each Preceptory—each Chapter of thy Order, shall learn, that, like a heretic, thou hast sinned with a Jewess. Those who tremble not at thy crime, willhold thee accursed for having so far dishonoured the cross thou wearest, as to follow a daughter of my people.”“Thou art keen-witted, Jewess,” replied the Templar, well aware of the truth of what she spoke, and that the rules of his Ordercondemned in the most positive manner, and under high penalties, such intrigues as he now prosecuted, and that, in some instances,even degradation had followed upon it—“thou art sharp-witted,” he said; “but loud must be thy voice of complaint, if it is heardbeyond the iron walls of this castle; within these, murmurs, laments, appeals to justice, and screams for help, die alike silent away.One thing only can save thee, Rebecca. Submit to thy fate—embrace our religion, and thou shalt go forth in such state, that many aNorman lady shall yield as well in pomp as in beauty to the favourite of the best lance among the defenders of the Temple.”“Submit to my fate!” said Rebecca—“and, sacred Heaven! to what fate?—embrace thy religion! and what religion can it be thatharbours such a villain?—THOU the best lance of the Templars!—Craven knight!—forsworn priest! I spit at thee, and I defy thee.—The God of Abraham’s promise hath opened an escape to his daughter—even from this abyss of infamy!”As she spoke, she threw open the latticed window which led to the bartisan, and in an instant after, stood on the very verge of theparapet, with not the slightest screen between her and the tremendous depth below. Unprepared for such a desperate effort, for she hadhitherto stood perfectly motionless, Bois-Guilbert had neither time to intercept nor to stop her. As he offered to advance, sheexclaimed, “Remain where thou art, proud Templar, or at thy choice advance!—one foot nearer, and I plunge myself from theprecipice; my body shall be crushed out of the very form of humanity upon the stones of that court-yard, ere it become the victim ofthy brutality!”As she spoke this, she clasped her hands and extended them towards heaven, as if imploring mercy on her soul before she made theﬁnal plunge. The Templar hesitated, and a resolution which had never yielded to pity or distress, gave way to his admiration of herfortitude. “Come down,” he said, “rash girl!—I swear by earth, and sea, and sky, I will offer thee no offence.”“I will not trust thee, Templar,” said Rebecca; “thou hast taught me better how to estimate the virtues of thine Order. The nextPreceptory would grant thee absolution for an oath, the keeping of which concerned nought but the honour or the dishonour of amiserable Jewish maiden.”“You do me injustice,” exclaimed the Templar fervently; “I swear to you by the name which I bear—by the cross on my bosom—bythe sword on my side—by the ancient crest of my fathers do I swear, I will do thee no injury whatsoever! If not for thyself, yet for thyfather’s sake forbear! I will be his friend, and in this castle he will need a powerful one.”“Alas!” said Rebecca, “I know it but too well—dare I trust thee?”“May my arms be reversed, and my name dishonoured,” said Brian de Bois-Guilbert, “if thou shalt have reason to complain of me!Many a law, many a commandment have I broken, but my word never.”“I will then trust thee,” said Rebecca, “thus far;” and she descended from the verge of the battlement, but remained standing closeby one of the embrasures, or “machicolles”, as they were then called.—“Here,” she said, “I take my stand. Remain where thou art, andif thou shalt attempt to diminish by one step the distance now between us, thou shalt see that the Jewish maiden will rather trust hersoul with God, than her honour to the Templar!”While Rebecca spoke thus, her high and ﬁrm resolve, which corresponded so well with the expressive beauty of her countenance,gave to her looks, air, and manner, a dignity that seemed more than mortal. Her glance quailed not, her cheek blanched not, for the fearof a fate so instant and so horrible; on the contrary, the thought that she had her fate at her command, and could escape at will frominfamy to death, gave a yet deeper colour of carnation to her complexion, and a yet more brilliant ﬁre to her eye. Bois-Guilbert, proudhimself and high-spirited, thought he had never beheld beauty so animated and so commanding.“Let there be peace between us, Rebecca,” he said.“Peace, if thou wilt,” answered Rebecca—“Peace—but with this space between.”“Thou needst no longer fear me,” said Bois-Guilbert.“I fear thee not,” replied she; “thanks to him that reared this dizzy tower so high, that nought could fall from it and live—thanks tohim, and to the God of Israel!—I fear thee not.”“Thou dost me injustice,” said the Templar; “by earth, sea, and sky, thou dost me injustice! I am not naturally that which you haveseen me, hard, selﬁsh, and relentless. It was woman that taught me cruelty, and on woman therefore I have exercised it; but not uponsuch as thou. Hear me, Rebecca—Never did knight take lance in his hand with a heart more devoted to the lady of his love than Briande Bois-Guilbert. She, the daughter of a petty baron, who boasted for all his domains but a ruinous tower, and an unproductivevineyard, and some few leagues of the barren Landes of Bourdeaux, her name was known wherever deeds of arms were done, knownwider than that of many a lady’s that had a county for a dowery.—Yes,” he continued, pacing up and down the little platform, with ananimation in which he seemed to lose all consciousness of Rebecca’s presence—“Yes, my deeds, my danger, my blood, made thename of Adelaide de Montemare known from the court of Castile to that of Byzantium. And how was I requited?—When I returnedwith my dear-bought honours, purchased by toil and blood, I found her wedded to a Gascon squire, whose name was never heardbeyond the limits of his own paltry domain! Truly did I love her, and bitterly did I revenge me of her broken faith! But my vengeancehas recoiled on myself. Since that day I have separated myself from life and its ties—My manhood must know no domestic home—must be soothed by no affectionate wife—My age must know no kindly hearth—My grave must be solitary, and no offspring mustoutlive me, to bear the ancient name of Bois-Guilbert. At the feet of my Superior I have laid down the right of self-action—theprivilege of independence. The Templar, a serf in all but the name, can possess neither lands nor goods, and lives, moves, andbreathes, but at the will and pleasure of another.”“Alas!” said Rebecca, “what advantages could compensate for such an absolute sacriﬁce?”“The power of vengeance, Rebecca,” replied the Templar, “and the prospects of ambition.”“An evil recompense,” said Rebecca, “for the surrender of the rights which are dearest to humanity.”“Say not so, maiden,” answered the Templar; “revenge is a feast for the gods! And if they have reserved it, as priests tell us, tothemselves, it is because they hold it an enjoyment too precious for the possession of mere mortals.—And ambition? it is a temptationwhich could disturb even the bliss of heaven itself.”—He paused a moment, and then added, “Rebecca! she who could prefer death todishonour, must have a proud and a powerful soul. Mine thou must be!—Nay, start not,” he added, “it must be with thine own consent,and on thine own terms. Thou must consent to share with me hopes more extended than can be viewed from the throne of a monarch!—Hear me ere you answer and judge ere you refuse.—The Templar loses, as thou hast said, his social rights, his power of free agency,but he becomes a member and a limb of a mighty body, before which thrones already tremble,—even as the single drop of rain whichmixes with the sea becomes an individual part of that resistless ocean, which undermines rocks and ingulfs royal armadas. Such aswelling ﬂood is that powerful league. Of this mighty Order I am no mean member, but already one of the Chief Commanders, andmay well aspire one day to hold the batoon of Grand Master. The poor soldiers of the Temple will not alone place their foot upon thenecks of kings—a hemp-sandall’d monk can do that. Our mailed step shall ascend their throne—our gauntlet shall wrench the sceptrefrom their gripe. Not the reign of your vainly-expected Messiah offers such power to your dispersed tribes as my ambition may aim at.I have sought but a kindred spirit to share it, and I have found such in thee.”“Sayest thou this to one of my people?” answered Rebecca. “Bethink thee—”“Answer me not,” said the Templar, “by urging the difference of our creeds; within our secret conclaves we hold these nursery talesin derision. Think not we long remained blind to the idiotical folly of our founders, who forswore every delight of life for the pleasureof dying martyrs by hunger, by thirst, and by pestilence, and by the swords of savages, while they vainly strove to defend a barrendesert, valuable only in the eyes of superstition. Our Order soon adopted bolder and wider views, and found out a betterindemniﬁcation for our sacriﬁces. Our immense possessions in every kingdom of Europe, our high military fame, which brings withinour circle the ﬂower of chivalry from every Christian clime—these are dedicated to ends of which our pious founders little dreamed,and which are equally concealed from such weak spirits as embrace our Order on the ancient principles, and whose superstition makesthem our passive tools. But I will not further withdraw the veil of our mysteries. That bugle-sound announces something which mayrequire my presence. Think on what I have said.—Farewell!—I do not say forgive me the violence I have threatened, for it wasnecessary to the display of thy character. Gold can be only known by the application of the touchstone. I will soon return, and holdfurther conference with thee.”He re-entered the turret-chamber, and descended the stair, leaving Rebecca scarcely more terriﬁed at the prospect of the death towhich she had been so lately exposed, than at the furious ambition of the bold bad man in whose power she found herself so unhappilyplaced. When she entered the turret-chamber, her ﬁrst duty was to return thanks to the God of Jacob for the protection which he hadafforded her, and to implore its continuance for her and for her father. Another name glided into her petition—it was that of thewounded Christian, whom fate had placed in the hands of bloodthirsty men, his avowed enemies. Her heart indeed checked her, as if,even in communing with the Deity in prayer, she mingled in her devotions the recollection of one with whose fate hers could have noalliance—a Nazarene, and an enemy to her faith. But the petition was already breathed, nor could all the narrow prejudices of her sectinduce Rebecca to wish it recalled.CHAPTER XXVA damn’d cramp piece of penmanship as ever I saw in my life!SHE STOOPS TO CONQUERWhen the Templar reached the hall of the castle, he found De Bracy already there. “Your love-suit,” said De Bracy, “hath, Isuppose, been disturbed, like mine, by this obstreperous summons. But you have come later and more reluctantly, and therefore Ipresume your interview has proved more agreeable than mine.”“Has your suit, then, been unsuccessfully paid to the Saxon heiress?” said the Templar.“By the bones of Thomas a Becket,” answered De Bracy, “the Lady Rowena must have heard that I cannot endure the sight ofwomen’s tears.”“Away!” said the Templar; “thou a leader of a Free Company, and regard a woman’s tears! A few drops sprinkled on the torch oflove, make the ﬂame blaze the brighter.”“Gramercy for the few drops of thy sprinkling,” replied De Bracy; “but this damsel hath wept enough to extinguish a beacon-light.Never was such wringing of hands and such overﬂowing of eyes, since the days of St Niobe, of whom Prior Aymer told us. 30 Awater-ﬁend hath possessed the fair Saxon.”“A legion of ﬁends have occupied the bosom of the Jewess,” replied the Templar; “for, I think no single one, not even Apollyonhimself, could have inspired such indomitable pride and resolution.—But where is Front-de-Bœuf? That horn is sounded more andmore clamorously.”“He is negotiating with the Jew, I suppose,” replied De Bracy, coolly; “probably the howls of Isaac have drowned the blast of thebugle. Thou mayst know, by experience, Sir Brian, that a Jew parting with his treasures on such terms as our friend Front-de-Bœuf islike to offer, will raise a clamour loud enough to be heard over twenty horns and trumpets to boot. But we will make the vassals callhim.”They were soon after joined by Front-de-Bœuf, who had been disturbed in his tyrannic cruelty in the manner with which the readeris acquainted, and had only tarried to give some necessary directions.“Let us see the cause of this cursed clamour,” said Front-de-Bœuf—“here is a letter, and, if I mistake not, it is in Saxon.”He looked at it, turning it round and round as if he had had really some hopes of coming at the meaning by inverting the position ofthe paper, and then handed it to De Bracy.“It may be magic spells for aught I know,” said De Bracy, who possessed his full proportion of the ignorance which characterisedthe chivalry of the period. “Our chaplain attempted to teach me to write,” he said, “but all my letters were formed like spear-heads andsword-blades, and so the old shaveling gave up the task.”“Give it me,” said the Templar. “We have that of the priestly character, that we have some knowledge to enlighten our valour.”“Let us proﬁt by your most reverend knowledge, then,” said De Bracy; “what says the scroll?”“It is a formal letter of deﬁance,” answered the Templar; “but, by our Lady of Bethlehem, if it be not a foolish jest, it is the mostextraordinary cartel that ever was sent across the drawbridge of a baronial castle.”“Jest!” said Front-de-Bœuf, “I would gladly know who dares jest with me in such a matter!—Read it, Sir Brian.”The Templar accordingly read it as follows:—“I, Wamba, the son of Witless, Jester to a noble and free-born man, Cedric ofRotherwood, called the Saxon,—And I, Gurth, the son of Beowulph, the swineherd—-”“Thou art mad,” said Front-de-Bœuf, interrupting the reader.“By St Luke, it is so set down,” answered the Templar. Then resuming his task, he went on,—“I, Gurth, the son of Beowulph,swineherd unto the said Cedric, with the assistance of our allies and confederates, who make common cause with us in this our feud,namely, the good knight, called for the present ‘Le Noir Faineant’, and the stout yeoman, Robert Locksley, called Cleave-the-Wand.Do you, Reginald Front de-Bœuf, and your allies and accomplices whomsoever, to wit, that whereas you have, without cause given orfeud declared, wrongfully and by mastery seized upon the person of our lord and master the said Cedric; also upon the person of anoble and freeborn damsel, the Lady Rowena of Hargottstandstede; also upon the person of a noble and freeborn man, Athelstane ofConingsburgh; also upon the persons of certain freeborn men, their ‘cnichts’; also upon certain serfs, their born bondsmen; also upon acertain Jew, named Isaac of York, together with his daughter, a Jewess, and certain horses and mules: Which noble persons, with their‘cnichts’ and slaves, and also with the horses and mules, Jew and Jewess beforesaid, were all in peace with his majesty, and travellingas liege subjects upon the king’s highway; therefore we require and demand that the said noble persons, namely, Cedric ofRotherwood, Rowena of Hargottstandstede, Athelstane of Coningsburgh, with their servants, ‘cnichts’, and followers, also the horsesand mules, Jew and Jewess aforesaid, together with all goods and chattels to them pertaining, be, within an hour after the deliveryhereof, delivered to us, or to those whom we shall appoint to receive the same, and that untouched and unharmed in body and goods.Failing of which, we do pronounce to you, that we hold ye as robbers and traitors, and will wager our bodies against ye in battle, siege,or otherwise, and do our utmost to your annoyance and destruction. Wherefore may God have you in his keeping.—Signed by us uponthe eve of St Withold’s day, under the great trysting oak in the Hart-hill Walk, the above being written by a holy man, Clerk to God,our Lady, and St Dunstan, in the Chapel of Copmanhurst.”At the bottom of this document was scrawled, in the ﬁrst place, a rude sketch of a cock’s head and comb, with a legend expressingthis hieroglyphic to be the sign-manual of Wamba, son of Witless. Under this respectable emblem stood a cross, stated to be the markof Gurth, the son of Beowulph. Then was written, in rough bold characters, the words, “Le Noir Faineant”. And, to conclude thewhole, an arrow, neatly enough drawn, was described as the mark of the yeoman Locksley.The knights heard this uncommon document read from end to end, and then gazed upon each other in silent amazement, as beingutterly at a loss to know what it could portend. De Bracy was the ﬁrst to break silence by an uncontrollable ﬁt of laughter, wherein hewas joined, though with more moderation, by the Templar. Front-de-Bœuf, on the contrary, seemed impatient of their ill-timedjocularity.“I give you plain warning,” he said, “fair sirs, that you had better consult how to bear yourselves under these circumstances, thangive way to such misplaced merriment.”“Front-de-Bœuf has not recovered his temper since his late overthrow,” said De Bracy to the Templar; “he is cowed at the very ideaof a cartel, though it come but from a fool and a swineherd.”“By St Michael,” answered Front-de-Bœuf, “I would thou couldst stand the whole brunt of this adventure thyself, De Bracy. Thesefellows dared not have acted with such inconceivable impudence, had they not been supported by some strong bands. There areenough of outlaws in this forest to resent my protecting the deer. I did but tie one fellow, who was taken redhanded and in the fact, tothe horns of a wild stag, which gored him to death in ﬁve minutes, and I had as many arrows shot at me as there were launched againstyonder target at Ashby.—Here, fellow,” he added, to one of his attendants, “hast thou sent out to see by what force this preciouschallenge is to be supported?”“There are at least two hundred men assembled in the woods,” answered a squire who was in attendance.“Here is a proper matter!” said Front-de-Bœuf, “this comes of lending you the use of my castle, that cannot manage yourundertaking quietly, but you must bring this nest of hornets about my ears!”“Of hornets?” said De Bracy; “of stingless drones rather; a band of lazy knaves, who take to the wood, and destroy the venisonrather than labour for their maintenance.”“Stingless!” replied Front-de-Bœuf; “fork-headed shafts of a cloth-yard in length, and these shot within the breadth of a Frenchcrown, are sting enough.”“For shame, Sir Knight!” said the Templar. “Let us summon our people, and sally forth upon them. One knight—ay, one man-at-arms, were enough for twenty such peasants.”“Enough, and too much,” said De Bracy; “I should only be ashamed to couch lance against them.”“True,” answered Front-de-Bœuf; “were they black Turks or Moors, Sir Templar, or the craven peasants of France, most valiant DeBracy; but these are English yeomen, over whom we shall have no advantage, save what we may derive from our arms and horses,which will avail us little in the glades of the forest. Sally, saidst thou? we have scarce men enough to defend the castle. The best ofmine are at York; so is all your band, De Bracy; and we have scarcely twenty, besides the handful that were engaged in this madbusiness.”“Thou dost not fear,” said the Templar, “that they can assemble in force sufﬁcient to attempt the castle?”“Not so, Sir Brian,” answered Front-de-Bœuf. “These outlaws have indeed a daring captain; but without machines, scaling ladders,and experienced leaders, my castle may defy them.”“Send to thy neighbours,” said the Templar, “let them assemble their people, and come to the rescue of three knights, besieged by ajester and a swineherd in the baronial castle of Reginald Front-de-Bœuf!”“You jest, Sir Knight,” answered the baron; “but to whom should I send?—Malvoisin is by this time at York with his retainers, andso are my other allies; and so should I have been, but for this infernal enterprise.”“Then send to York, and recall our people,” said De Bracy. “If they abide the shaking of my standard, or the sight of my FreeCompanions, I will give them credit for the boldest outlaws ever bent bow in green-wood.”“And who shall bear such a message?” said Front-de-Bœuf; “they will beset every path, and rip the errand out of his bosom.—Ihave it,” he added, after pausing for a moment—“Sir Templar, thou canst write as well as read, and if we can but ﬁnd the writingmaterials of my chaplain, who died a twelvemonth since in the midst of his Christmas carousals—”“So please ye,” said the squire, who was still in attendance, “I think old Urfried has them somewhere in keeping, for love of theconfessor. He was the last man, I have heard her tell, who ever said aught to her, which man ought in courtesy to address to maid ormatron.”“Go, search them out, Engelred,” said Front-de-Bœuf; “and then, Sir Templar, thou shalt return an answer to this bold challenge.”“I would rather do it at the sword’s point than at that of the pen,” said Bois-Guilbert; “but be it as you will.”He sat down accordingly, and indited, in the French language, an epistle of the following tenor:—“Sir Reginald Front-de-Bœuf,with his noble and knightly allies and confederates, receive no deﬁances at the hands of slaves, bondsmen, or fugitives. If the personcalling himself the Black Knight have indeed a claim to the honours of chivalry, he ought to know that he stands degraded by hispresent association, and has no right to ask reckoning at the hands of good men of noble blood. Touching the prisoners we have made,we do in Christian charity require you to send a man of religion, to receive their confession, and reconcile them with God; since it isour ﬁxed intention to execute them this morning before noon, so that their heads being placed on the battlements, shall show to allmen how lightly we esteem those who have bestirred themselves in their rescue. Wherefore, as above, we require you to send a priestto reconcile them to God, in doing which you shall render them the last earthly service.”This letter being folded, was delivered to the squire, and by him to the messenger who waited without, as the answer to that whichhe had brought.The yeoman having thus accomplished his mission, returned to the head-quarters of the allies, which were for the presentestablished under a venerable oak-tree, about three arrow-ﬂights distant from the castle. Here Wamba and Gurth, with their allies theBlack Knight and Locksley, and the jovial hermit, awaited with impatience an answer to their summons. Around, and at a distancefrom them, were seen many a bold yeoman, whose silvan dress and weatherbeaten countenances showed the ordinary nature of theiroccupation. More than two hundred had already assembled, and others were fast coming in. Those whom they obeyed as leaders wereonly distinguished from the others by a feather in the cap, their dress, arms, and equipments being in all other respects the same.Besides these bands, a less orderly and a worse armed force, consisting of the Saxon inhabitants of the neighbouring township, aswell as many bondsmen and servants from Cedric’s extensive estate, had already arrived, for the purpose of assisting in his rescue.Few of these were armed otherwise than with such rustic weapons as necessity sometimes converts to military purposes. Boar-spears,scythes, ﬂails, and the like, were their chief arms; for the Normans, with the usual policy of conquerors, were jealous of permitting tothe vanquished Saxons the possession or the use of swords and spears. These circumstances rendered the assistance of the Saxons farfrom being so formidable to the besieged, as the strength of the men themselves, their superior numbers, and the animation inspired bya just cause, might otherwise well have made them. It was to the leaders of this motley army that the letter of the Templar was nowdelivered.Reference was at ﬁrst made to the chaplain for an exposition of its contents.“By the crook of St Dunstan,” said that worthy ecclesiastic, “which hath brought more sheep within the sheepfold than the crook ofe’er another saint in Paradise, I swear that I cannot expound unto you this jargon, which, whether it be French or Arabic, is beyond myguess.”He then gave the letter to Gurth, who shook his head grufﬂy, and passed it to Wamba. The Jester looked at each of the four cornersof the paper with such a grin of affected intelligence as a monkey is apt to assume upon similar occasions, then cut a caper, and gavethe letter to Locksley.“If the long letters were bows, and the short letters broad arrows, I might know something of the matter,” said the brave yeoman;“but as the matter stands, the meaning is as safe, for me, as the stag that’s at twelve miles distance.”“I must be clerk, then,” said the Black Knight; and taking the letter from Locksley, he ﬁrst read it over to himself, and thenexplained the meaning in Saxon to his confederates.“Execute the noble Cedric!” exclaimed Wamba; “by the rood, thou must be mistaken, Sir Knight.”“Not I, my worthy friend,” replied the knight, “I have explained the words as they are here set down.”“Then, by St Thomas of Canterbury,” replied Gurth, “we will have the castle, should we tear it down with our hands!”“We have nothing else to tear it with,” replied Wamba; “but mine are scarce ﬁt to make mammocks of freestone and mortar.”“’Tis but a contrivance to gain time,” said Locksley; “they dare not do a deed for which I could exact a fearful penalty.”“I would,” said the Black Knight, “there were some one among us who could obtain admission into the castle, and discover how thecase stands with the besieged. Methinks, as they require a confessor to be sent, this holy hermit might at once exercise his piousvocation, and procure us the information we desire.”“A plague on thee, and thy advice!” said the pious hermit; “I tell thee, Sir Slothful Knight, that when I doff my friar’s frock, mypriesthood, my sanctity, my very Latin, are put off along with it; and when in my green jerkin, I can better kill twenty deer thanconfess one Christian.”“I fear,” said the Black Knight, “I fear greatly, there is no one here that is qualiﬁed to take upon him, for the nonce, this samecharacter of father confessor?”All looked on each other, and were silent.“I see,” said Wamba, after a short pause, “that the fool must be still the fool, and put his neck in the venture which wise men shrinkfrom. You must know, my dear cousins and countrymen, that I wore russet before I wore motley, and was bred to be a friar, until abrain-fever came upon me and left me just wit enough to be a fool. I trust, with the assistance of the good hermit’s frock, together withthe priesthood, sanctity, and learning which are stitched into the cowl of it, I shall be found qualiﬁed to administer both worldly andghostly comfort to our worthy master Cedric, and his companions in adversity.”“Hath he sense enough, thinkst thou?” said the Black Knight, addressing Gurth.“I know not,” said Gurth; “but if he hath not, it will be the ﬁrst time he hath wanted wit to turn his folly to account.”“On with the frock, then, good fellow,” quoth the Knight, “and let thy master send us an account of their situation within the castle.Their numbers must be few, and it is ﬁve to one they may be accessible by a sudden and bold attack. Time wears—away with thee.”“And, in the meantime,” said Locksley, “we will beset the place so closely, that not so much as a ﬂy shall carry news from thence.So that, my good friend,” he continued, addressing Wamba, “thou mayst assure these tyrants, that whatever violence they exercise onthe persons of their prisoners, shall be most severely repaid upon their own.”“Pax vobiscum,” said Wamba, who was now mufﬂed in his religious disguise.And so saying he imitated the solemn and stately deportment of a friar, and departed to execute his mission.CHAPTER XXVIThe hottest horse will oft be cool,The dullest will show ﬁre;The friar will often play the fool,The fool will play the friar.OLD SONGWhen the Jester, arrayed in the cowl and frock of the hermit, and having his knotted cord twisted round his middle, stood before theportal of the castle of Front-de-Bœuf, the warder demanded of him his name and errand.“Pax vobiscum,” answered the Jester, “I am a poor brother of the Order of St Francis, who come hither to do my ofﬁce to certainunhappy prisoners now secured within this castle.”“Thou art a bold friar,” said the warder, “to come hither, where, saving our own drunken confessor, a cock of thy feather hath notcrowed these twenty years.”“Yet I pray thee, do mine errand to the lord of the castle,” answered the pretended friar; “trust me it will ﬁnd good acceptance withhim, and the cock shall crow, that the whole castle shall hear him.”“Gramercy,” said the warder; “but if I come to shame for leaving my post upon thine errand, I will try whether a friar’s grey gownbe proof against a grey-goose shaft.”With this threat he left his turret, and carried to the hall of the castle his unwonted intelligence, that a holy friar stood before the gateand demanded instant admission. With no small wonder he received his master’s commands to admit the holy man immediately; and,having previously manned the entrance to guard against surprise, he obeyed, without further scruple, the commands which he hadreceived. The harebrained self-conceit which had emboldened Wamba to undertake this dangerous ofﬁce, was scarce sufﬁcient tosupport him when he found himself in the presence of a man so dreadful, and so much dreaded, as Reginald Front-de-Bœuf, and hebrought out his “pax vobiscum”, to which he, in a good measure, trusted for supporting his character, with more anxiety and hesitationthan had hitherto accompanied it. But Front-de-Bœuf was accustomed to see men of all ranks tremble in his presence, so that thetimidity of the supposed father did not give him any cause of suspicion.“Who and whence art thou, priest?” said he.“‘Pax vobiscum’,” reiterated the Jester, “I am a poor servant of St Francis, who, travelling through this wilderness, have fallenamong thieves, (as Scripture hath it,) ‘quidam viator incidit in latrones’, which thieves have sent me unto this castle in order to do myghostly ofﬁce on two persons condemned by your honourable justice.”“Ay, right,” answered Front-de-Bœuf; “and canst thou tell me, holy father, the number of those banditti?”“Gallant sir,” answered the Jester, “‘nomen illis legio’, their name is legion.”“Tell me in plain terms what numbers there are, or, priest, thy cloak and cord will ill protect thee.”“Alas!” said the supposed friar, “‘cor meum eructavit’, that is to say, I was like to burst with fear! but I conceive they may be—whatof yeomen—what of commons, at least ﬁve hundred men.”“What!” said the Templar, who came into the hall that moment, “muster the wasps so thick here? it is time to stiﬂe such amischievous brood.” Then taking Front-de-Bœuf aside “Knowest thou the priest?”“He is a stranger from a distant convent,” said Front-de-Bœuf; “I know him not.”“Then trust him not with thy purpose in words,” answered the Templar. “Let him carry a written order to De Bracy’s company ofFree Companions, to repair instantly to their master’s aid. In the meantime, and that the shaveling may suspect nothing, permit him togo freely about his task of preparing these Saxon hogs for the slaughter-house.”“It shall be so,” said Front-de-Bœuf. And he forthwith appointed a domestic to conduct Wamba to the apartment where Cedric andAthelstane were conﬁned.The impatience of Cedric had been rather enhanced than diminished by his conﬁnement. He walked from one end of the hall to theother, with the attitude of one who advances to charge an enemy, or to storm the breach of a beleaguered place, sometimes ejaculatingto himself, sometimes addressing Athelstane, who stoutly and stoically awaited the issue of the adventure, digesting, in the meantime,with great composure, the liberal meal which he had made at noon, and not greatly interesting himself about the duration of hiscaptivity, which he concluded, would, like all earthly evils, ﬁnd an end in Heaven’s good time.“‘Pax vobiscum’,” said the Jester, entering the apartment; “the blessing of St Dunstan, St Dennis, St Duthoc, and all other saintswhatsoever, be upon ye and about ye.”“Enter freely,” answered Cedric to the supposed friar; “with what intent art thou come hither?”“To bid you prepare yourselves for death,” answered the Jester.“It is impossible!” replied Cedric, starting. “Fearless and wicked as they are, they dare not attempt such open and gratuitouscruelty!”“Alas!” said the Jester, “to restrain them by their sense of humanity, is the same as to stop a runaway horse with a bridle of silkthread. Bethink thee, therefore, noble Cedric, and you also, gallant Athelstane, what crimes you have committed in the ﬂesh; for thisvery day will ye be called to answer at a higher tribunal.”“Hearest thou this, Athelstane?” said Cedric; “we must rouse up our hearts to this last action, since better it is we should die likemen, than live like slaves.”“I am ready,” answered Athelstane, “to stand the worst of their malice, and shall walk to my death with as much composure as everI did to my dinner.”“Let us then unto our holy gear, father,” said Cedric.“Wait yet a moment, good uncle,” said the Jester, in his natural tone; “better look long before you leap in the dark.”“By my faith,” said Cedric, “I should know that voice!”“It is that of your trusty slave and jester,” answered Wamba, throwing back his cowl. “Had you taken a fool’s advice formerly, youwould not have been here at all. Take a fool’s advice now, and you will not be here long.”“How mean’st thou, knave?” answered the Saxon.“Even thus,” replied Wamba; “take thou this frock and cord, which are all the orders I ever had, and march quietly out of the castle,leaving me your cloak and girdle to take the long leap in thy stead.”“Leave thee in my stead!” said Cedric, astonished at the proposal; “why, they would hang thee, my poor knave.”“E’en let them do as they are permitted,” said Wamba; “I trust—no disparagement to your birth—that the son of Witless may hangin a chain with as much gravity as the chain hung upon his ancestor the alderman.”“Well, Wamba,” answered Cedric, “for one thing will I grant thy request. And that is, if thou wilt make the exchange of garmentswith Lord Athelstane instead of me.”“No, by St Dunstan,” answered Wamba; “there were little reason in that. Good right there is, that the son of Witless should suffer tosave the son of Hereward; but little wisdom there were in his dying for the beneﬁt of one whose fathers were strangers to his.”“Villain,” said Cedric, “the fathers of Athelstane were monarchs of England!”“They might be whomsoever they pleased,” replied Wamba; “but my neck stands too straight upon my shoulders to have it twistedfor their sake. Wherefore, good my master, either take my proffer yourself, or suffer me to leave this dungeon as free as I entered.”“Let the old tree wither,” continued Cedric, “so the stately hope of the forest be preserved. Save the noble Athelstane, my trustyWamba! it is the duty of each who has Saxon blood in his veins. Thou and I will abide together the utmost rage of our injuriousoppressors, while he, free and safe, shall arouse the awakened spirits of our countrymen to avenge us.”“Not so, father Cedric,” said Athelstane, grasping his hand,—for, when roused to think or act, his deeds and sentiments were notunbecoming his high race—“Not so,” he continued; “I would rather remain in this hall a week without food save the prisoner’s stintedloaf, or drink save the prisoner’s measure of water, than embrace the opportunity to escape which the slave’s untaught kindness haspurveyed for his master.”“You are called wise men, sirs,” said the Jester, “and I a crazed fool; but, uncle Cedric, and cousin Athelstane, the fool shall decidethis controversy for ye, and save ye the trouble of straining courtesies any farther. I am like John-a-Duck’s mare, that will let no manmount her but John-a-Duck. I came to save my master, and if he will not consent—basta—I can but go away home again. Kind servicecannot be chucked from hand to hand like a shuttlecock or stool-ball. I’ll hang for no man but my own born master.”“Go, then, noble Cedric,” said Athelstane, “neglect not this opportunity. Your presence without may encourage friends to our rescue—your remaining here would ruin us all.”“And is there any prospect, then, of rescue from without?” said Cedric, looking to the Jester.“Prospect, indeed!” echoed Wamba; “let me tell you, when you ﬁll my cloak, you are wrapped in a general’s cassock. Five hundredmen are there without, and I was this morning one of the chief leaders. My fool’s cap was a casque, and my bauble a truncheon. Well,we shall see what good they will make by exchanging a fool for a wise man. Truly, I fear they will lose in valour what they may gainin discretion. And so farewell, master, and be kind to poor Gurth and his dog Fangs; and let my cockscomb hang in the hall atRotherwood, in memory that I ﬂung away my life for my master, like a faithful—-fool.”The last word came out with a sort of double expression, betwixt jest and earnest. The tears stood in Cedric’s eyes.“Thy memory shall be preserved,” he said, “while ﬁdelity and affection have honour upon earth! But that I trust I shall ﬁnd themeans of saving Rowena, and thee, Athelstane, and thee, also, my poor Wamba, thou shouldst not overbear me in this matter.”The exchange of dress was now accomplished, when a sudden doubt struck Cedric.“I know no language,” he said, “but my own, and a few words of their mincing Norman. How shall I bear myself like a reverend“I know no language,” he said, “but my own, and a few words of their mincing Norman. How shall I bear myself like a reverendbrother?”“The spell lies in two words,” replied Wamba—“‘Pax vobiscum’ will answer all queries. If you go or come, eat or drink, bless orban, ‘Pax vobiscum’ carries you through it all. It is as useful to a friar as a broomstick to a witch, or a wand to a conjurer. Speak it butthus, in a deep grave tone,—‘Pax vobiscum!’—it is irresistible—Watch and ward, knight and squire, foot and horse, it acts as a charmupon them all. I think, if they bring me out to be hanged to-morrow, as is much to be doubted they may, I will try its weight upon theﬁnisher of the sentence.”“If such prove the case,” said the master, “my religious orders are soon taken—‘Pax vobiscum’. I trust I shall remember the pass-word.—Noble Athelstane, farewell; and farewell, my poor boy, whose heart might make amends for a weaker head—I will save you,or return and die with you. The royal blood of our Saxon kings shall not be spilt while mine beats in my veins; nor shall one hair fallfrom the head of the kind knave who risked himself for his master, if Cedric’s peril can prevent it.—Farewell.”“Farewell, noble Cedric,” said Athelstane; “remember it is the true part of a friar to accept refreshment, if you are offered any.”“Farewell, uncle,” added Wamba; “and remember ‘Pax vobiscum’.”Thus exhorted, Cedric sallied forth upon his expedition; and it was not long ere he had occasion to try the force of that spell whichhis Jester had recommended as omnipotent. In a low-arched and dusky passage, by which he endeavoured to work his way to the hallof the castle, he was interrupted by a female form.“‘Pax vobiscum!’” said the pseudo friar, and was endeavouring to hurry past, when a soft voice replied, “‘Et vobis—quaso, dominereverendissime, pro misericordia vestra’.”“I am somewhat deaf,” replied Cedric, in good Saxon, and at the same time muttered to himself, “A curse on the fool and his ‘Paxvobiscum!’ I have lost my javelin at the ﬁrst cast.”It was, however, no unusual thing for a priest of those days to be deaf of his Latin ear, and this the person who now addressedCedric knew full well.“I pray you of dear love, reverend father,” she replied in his own language, “that you will deign to visit with your ghostly comfort awounded prisoner of this castle, and have such compassion upon him and us as thy holy ofﬁce teaches—Never shall good deed sohighly advantage thy convent.”“Daughter,” answered Cedric, much embarrassed, “my time in this castle will not permit me to exercise the duties of mine ofﬁce—Imust presently forth—there is life and death upon my speed.”“Yet, father, let me entreat you by the vow you have taken on you,” replied the suppliant, “not to leave the oppressed andendangered without counsel or succour.”“May the ﬁend ﬂy away with me, and leave me in Ifrin with the souls of Odin and of Thor!” answered Cedric impatiently, andwould probably have proceeded in the same tone of total departure from his spiritual character, when the colloquy was interrupted bythe harsh voice of Urfried, the old crone of the turret.“How, minion,” said she to the female speaker, “is this the manner in which you requite the kindness which permitted thee to leavethy prison-cell yonder?—Puttest thou the reverend man to use ungracious language to free himself from the importunities of aJewess?”“A Jewess!” said Cedric, availing himself of the information to get clear of their interruption,—“Let me pass, woman! stop me notat your peril. I am fresh from my holy ofﬁce, and would avoid pollution.”“Come this way, father,” said the old hag, “thou art a stranger in this castle, and canst not leave it without a guide. Come hither, for Iwould speak with thee.—And you, daughter of an accursed race, go to the sick man’s chamber, and tend him until my return; and woebetide you if you again quit it without my permission!”Rebecca retreated. Her importunities had prevailed upon Urfried to suffer her to quit the turret, and Urfried had employed herservices where she herself would most gladly have paid them, by the bedside of the wounded Ivanhoe. With an understanding awaketo their dangerous situation, and prompt to avail herself of each means of safety which occurred, Rebecca had hoped something fromthe presence of a man of religion, who, she learned from Urfried, had penetrated into this godless castle. She watched the return of thesupposed ecclesiastic, with the purpose of addressing him, and interesting him in favour of the prisoners; with what imperfect successthe reader has been just acquainted.CHAPTER XXVIIFond wretch! and what canst thou relate,But deeds of sorrow, shame, and sin?Thy deeds are proved—thou know’st thy fate;But come, thy tale—begin—begin.But I have griefs of other kind,Troubles and sorrows more severe;Give me to ease my tortured mind,Lend to my woes a patient ear;And let me, if I may not ﬁndA friend to help—ﬁnd one to hear.CRABBE’S HALL OF JUSTICEWhen Urfried had with clamours and menaces driven Rebecca back to the apartment from which she had sallied, she proceeded toconduct the unwilling Cedric into a small apartment, the door of which she heedfully secured. Then fetching from a cupboard a stoupof wine and two ﬂagons, she placed them on the table, and said in a tone rather asserting a fact than asking a question, “Thou artSaxon, father—Deny it not,” she continued, observing that Cedric hastened not to reply; “the sounds of my native language are sweetto mine ears, though seldom heard save from the tongues of the wretched and degraded serfs on whom the proud Normans impose themeanest drudgery of this dwelling. Thou art a Saxon, father—a Saxon, and, save as thou art a servant of God, a freeman.—Thineaccents are sweet in mine ear.”“Do not Saxon priests visit this castle, then?” replied Cedric; “it were, methinks, their duty to comfort the outcast and oppressedchildren of the soil.”“They come not—or if they come, they better love to revel at the boards of their conquerors,” answered Urfried, “than to hear thegroans of their countrymen—so, at least, report speaks of them—of myself I can say little. This castle, for ten years, has opened to nopriest save the debauched Norman chaplain who partook the nightly revels of Front-de-Bœuf, and he has been long gone to render anaccount of his stewardship.—But thou art a Saxon—a Saxon priest, and I have one question to ask of thee.”“I am a Saxon,” answered Cedric, “but unworthy, surely, of the name of priest. Let me begone on my way—I swear I will return, orsend one of our fathers more worthy to hear your confession.”“Stay yet a while,” said Urfried; “the accents of the voice which thou hearest now will soon be choked with the cold earth, and Iwould not descend to it like the beast I have lived. But wine must give me strength to tell the horrors of my tale.” She poured out acup, and drank it with a frightful avidity, which seemed desirous of draining the last drop in the goblet. “It stupiﬁes,” she said, lookingupwards as she ﬁnished her drought, “but it cannot cheer—Partake it, father, if you would hear my tale without sinking down upon thepavement.” Cedric would have avoided pledging her in this ominous conviviality, but the sign which she made to him expressedimpatience and despair. He complied with her request, and answered her challenge in a large wine-cup; she then proceeded with herstory, as if appeased by his complaisance.“I was not born,” she said, “father, the wretch that thou now seest me. I was free, was happy, was honoured, loved, and wasbeloved. I am now a slave, miserable and degraded—the sport of my masters’ passions while I had yet beauty—the object of theircontempt, scorn, and hatred, since it has passed away. Dost thou wonder, father, that I should hate mankind, and, above all, the racethat has wrought this change in me? Can the wrinkled decrepit hag before thee, whose wrath must vent itself in impotent curses, forgetshe was once the daughter of the noble Thane of Torquilstone, before whose frown a thousand vassals trembled?”“Thou the daughter of Torquil Wolfganger!” said Cedric, receding as he spoke; “thou—thou—the daughter of that noble Saxon, myfather’s friend and companion in arms!”“Thy father’s friend!” echoed Urfried; “then Cedric called the Saxon stands before me, for the noble Hereward of Rotherwood hadbut one son, whose name is well known among his countrymen. But if thou art Cedric of Rotherwood, why this religious dress?—hastthou too despaired of saving thy country, and sought refuge from oppression in the shade of the convent?”“It matters not who I am,” said Cedric; “proceed, unhappy woman, with thy tale of horror and guilt!—Guilt there must be—there isguilt even in thy living to tell it.”“There is—there is,” answered the wretched woman, “deep, black, damning guilt,—guilt, that lies like a load at my breast—guilt,that all the penitential ﬁres of hereafter cannot cleanse.—Yes, in these halls, stained with the noble and pure blood of my father andmy brethren—in these very halls, to have lived the paramour of their murderer, the slave at once and the partaker of his pleasures, wasto render every breath which I drew of vital air, a crime and a curse.”“Wretched woman!” exclaimed Cedric. “And while the friends of thy father—while each true Saxon heart, as it breathed a requiemfor his soul, and those of his valiant sons, forgot not in their prayers the murdered Ulrica—while all mourned and honoured the dead,thou hast lived to merit our hate and execration—lived to unite thyself with the vile tyrant who murdered thy nearest and dearest—who shed the blood of infancy, rather than a male of the noble house of Torquil Wolfganger should survive—with him hast thou livedto unite thyself, and in the hands of lawless love!”“In lawless hands, indeed, but not in those of love!” answered the hag; “love will sooner visit the regions of eternal doom, thanthose unhallowed vaults.—No, with that at least I cannot reproach myself—hatred to Front-de-Bœuf and his race governed my soulmost deeply, even in the hour of his guilty endearments.”“You hated him, and yet you lived,” replied Cedric; “wretch! was there no poniard—no knife—no bodkin!—Well was it for thee,since thou didst prize such an existence, that the secrets of a Norman castle are like those of the grave. For had I but dreamed of thedaughter of Torquil living in foul communion with the murderer of her father, the sword of a true Saxon had found thee out even in thearms of thy paramour!”“Wouldst thou indeed have done this justice to the name of Torquil?” said Ulrica, for we may now lay aside her assumed name ofUrfried; “thou art then the true Saxon report speaks thee! for even within these accursed walls, where, as thou well sayest, guiltshrouds itself in inscrutable mystery, even there has the name of Cedric been sounded—and I, wretched and degraded, have rejoiced tothink that there yet breathed an avenger of our unhappy nation.—I also have had my hours of vengeance—I have fomented thequarrels of our foes, and heated drunken revelry into murderous broil—I have seen their blood ﬂow—I have heard their dying groans!—Look on me, Cedric—are there not still left on this foul and faded face some traces of the features of Torquil?”“Ask me not of them, Ulrica,” replied Cedric, in a tone of grief mixed with abhorrence; “these traces form such a resemblance asarises from the graves of the dead, when a ﬁend has animated the lifeless corpse.”“Be it so,” answered Ulrica; “yet wore these ﬁendish features the mask of a spirit of light when they were able to set at variance theelder Front-de-Bœuf and his son Reginald! The darkness of hell should hide what followed, but revenge must lift the veil, and darklyintimate what it would raise the dead to speak aloud. Long had the smouldering ﬁre of discord glowed between the tyrant father andhis savage son—long had I nursed, in secret, the unnatural hatred—it blazed forth in an hour of drunken wassail, and at his own boardfell my oppressor by the hand of his own son—such are the secrets these vaults conceal!—Rend asunder, ye accursed arches,” sheadded, looking up towards the roof, “and bury in your fall all who are conscious of the hideous mystery!”“And thou, creature of guilt and misery,” said Cedric, “what became thy lot on the death of thy ravisher?”“Guess it, but ask it not.—Here—here I dwelt, till age, premature age, has stamped its ghastly features on my countenance—scorned and insulted where I was once obeyed, and compelled to bound the revenge which had once such ample scope, to the effortsof petty malice of a discontented menial, or the vain or unheeded curses of an impotent hag—condemned to hear from my lonelyturret the sounds of revelry in which I once partook, or the shrieks and groans of new victims of oppression.”“Ulrica,” said Cedric, “with a heart which still, I fear, regrets the lost reward of thy crimes, as much as the deeds by which thoudidst acquire that meed, how didst thou dare to address thee to one who wears this robe? Consider, unhappy woman, what could thesainted Edward himself do for thee, were he here in bodily presence? The royal Confessor was endowed by heaven with power tocleanse the ulcers of the body, but only God himself can cure the leprosy of the soul.”“Yet, turn not from me, stern prophet of wrath,” she exclaimed, “but tell me, if thou canst, in what shall terminate these new andawful feelings that burst on my solitude—Why do deeds, long since done, rise before me in new and irresistible horrors? What fate isprepared beyond the grave for her, to whom God has assigned on earth a lot of such unspeakable wretchedness? Better had I turn toWoden, Hertha, and Zernebock—to Mista, and to Skogula, the gods of our yet unbaptized ancestors, than endure the dreadfulanticipations which have of late haunted my waking and my sleeping hours!”“I am no priest,” said Cedric, turning with disgust from this miserable picture of guilt, wretchedness, and despair; “I am no priest,though I wear a priest’s garment.”“Priest or layman,” answered Ulrica, “thou art the ﬁrst I have seen for twenty years, by whom God was feared or man regarded; anddost thou bid me despair?”“I bid thee repent,” said Cedric. “Seek to prayer and penance, and mayest thou ﬁnd acceptance! But I cannot, I will not, longerabide with thee.”“Stay yet a moment!” said Ulrica; “leave me not now, son of my father’s friend, lest the demon who has governed my life shouldtempt me to avenge myself of thy hard-hearted scorn—Thinkest thou, if Front-de-Bœuf found Cedric the Saxon in his castle, in such adisguise, that thy life would be a long one?—Already his eye has been upon thee like a falcon on his prey.”“And be it so,” said Cedric; “and let him tear me with beak and talons, ere my tongue say one word which my heart doth notwarrant. I will die a Saxon—true in word, open in deed—I bid thee avaunt!—touch me not, stay me not!—The sight of Front-de-Bœufhimself is less odious to me than thou, degraded and degenerate as thou art.”“Be it so,” said Ulrica, no longer interrupting him; “go thy way, and forget, in the insolence of thy superority, that the wretch beforethee is the daughter of thy father’s friend.—Go thy way—if I am separated from mankind by my sufferings—separated from thosewhose aid I might most justly expect—not less will I be separated from them in my revenge!—No man shall aid me, but the ears of allmen shall tingle to hear of the deed which I shall dare to do!—Farewell!—thy scorn has burst the last tie which seemed yet to unite meto my kind—a thought that my woes might claim the compassion of my people.”“Ulrica,” said Cedric, softened by this appeal, “hast thou borne up and endured to live through so much guilt and so much misery,and wilt thou now yield to despair when thine eyes are opened to thy crimes, and when repentance were thy ﬁtter occupation?”“Cedric,” answered Ulrica, “thou little knowest the human heart. To act as I have acted, to think as I have thought, requires themaddening love of pleasure, mingled with the keen appetite of revenge, the proud consciousness of power; droughts too intoxicatingfor the human heart to bear, and yet retain the power to prevent. Their force has long passed away—Age has no pleasures, wrinkleshave no inﬂuence, revenge itself dies away in impotent curses. Then comes remorse, with all its vipers, mixed with vain regrets for thepast, and despair for the future!—Then, when all other strong impulses have ceased, we become like the ﬁends in hell, who may feelremorse, but never repentance.—But thy words have awakened a new soul within me—Well hast thou said, all is possible for thosewho dare to die!—Thou hast shown me the means of revenge, and be assured I will embrace them. It has hitherto shared this wastedbosom with other and with rival passions—henceforward it shall possess me wholly, and thou thyself shalt say, that, whatever was thelife of Ulrica, her death well became the daughter of the noble Torquil. There is a force without beleaguering this accursed castle—hasten to lead them to the attack, and when thou shalt see a red ﬂag wave from the turret on the eastern angle of the donjon, press theNormans hard—they will then have enough to do within, and you may win the wall in spite both of bow and mangonel.—Begone, Ipray thee—follow thine own fate, and leave me to mine.”Cedric would have enquired farther into the purpose which she thus darkly announced, but the stern voice of Front-de-Bœuf washeard, exclaiming, “Where tarries this loitering priest? By the scallop-shell of Compostella, I will make a martyr of him, if he loitershere to hatch treason among my domestics!”“What a true prophet,” said Ulrica, “is an evil conscience! But heed him not—out and to thy people—Cry your Saxon onslaught,and let them sing their war-song of Rollo, if they will; vengeance shall bear a burden to it.”As she thus spoke, she vanished through a private door, and Reginald Front-de-Bœuf entered the apartment. Cedric, with somedifﬁculty, compelled himself to make obeisance to the haughty Baron, who returned his courtesy with a slight inclination of the head.“Thy penitents, father, have made a long shrift—it is the better for them, since it is the last they shall ever make. Hast thou preparedthem for death?”“I found them,” said Cedric, in such French as he could command, “expecting the worst, from the moment they knew into whosepower they had fallen.”“How now, Sir Friar,” replied Front-de-Bœuf, “thy speech, methinks, smacks of a Saxon tongue?”“I was bred in the convent of St Withold of Burton,” answered Cedric.“Ay?” said the Baron; “it had been better for thee to have been a Norman, and better for my purpose too; but need has no choice ofmessengers. That St Withold’s of Burton is an owlet’s nest worth the harrying. The day will soon come that the frock shall protect theSaxon as little as the mail-coat.”“God’s will be done,” said Cedric, in a voice tremulous with passion, which Front-de-Bœuf imputed to fear.“I see,” said he, “thou dreamest already that our men-at-arms are in thy refectory and thy ale-vaults. But do me one cast of thy holyofﬁce, and, come what list of others, thou shalt sleep as safe in thy cell as a snail within his shell of proof.”“Speak your commands,” said Cedric, with suppressed emotion.“Follow me through this passage, then, that I may dismiss thee by the postern.”And as he strode on his way before the supposed friar, Front-de-Bœuf thus schooled him in the part which he desired he should act.“Thou seest, Sir Friar, yon herd of Saxon swine, who have dared to environ this castle of Torquilstone—Tell them whatever thouhast a mind of the weakness of this fortalice, or aught else that can detain them before it for twenty-four hours. Meantime bear thouthis scroll—But soft—canst read, Sir Priest?”“Not a jot I,” answered Cedric, “save on my breviary; and then I know the characters, because I have the holy service by heart,praised be Our Lady and St Withold!”“The ﬁtter messenger for my purpose.—Carry thou this scroll to the castle of Philip de Malvoisin; say it cometh from me, and iswritten by the Templar Brian de Bois-Guilbert, and that I pray him to send it to York with all the speed man and horse can make.Meanwhile, tell him to doubt nothing, he shall ﬁnd us whole and sound behind our battlement—Shame on it, that we should becompelled to hide thus by a pack of runagates, who are wont to ﬂy even at the ﬂash of our pennons and the tramp of our horses! I sayto thee, priest, contrive some cast of thine art to keep the knaves where they are, until our friends bring up their lances. My vengeanceis awake, and she is a falcon that slumbers not till she has been gorged.”“By my patron saint,” said Cedric, with deeper energy than became his character, “and by every saint who has lived and died inEngland, your commands shall be obeyed! Not a Saxon shall stir from before these walls, if I have art and inﬂuence to detain themthere.”“Ha!” said Front-de-Bœuf, “thou changest thy tone, Sir Priest, and speakest brief and bold, as if thy heart were in the slaughter ofthe Saxon herd; and yet thou art thyself of kindred to the swine?”Cedric was no ready practiser of the art of dissimulation, and would at this moment have been much the better of a hint fromWamba’s more fertile brain. But necessity, according to the ancient proverb, sharpens invention, and he muttered something under hiscowl concerning the men in question being excommunicated outlaws both to church and to kingdom.“‘Despardieux’,” answered Front-de-Bœuf, “thou hast spoken the very truth—I forgot that the knaves can strip a fat abbot, as wellas if they had been born south of yonder salt channel. Was it not he of St Ives whom they tied to an oak-tree, and compelled to sing amass while they were riﬂing his mails and his wallets?—No, by our Lady—that jest was played by Gualtier of Middleton, one of ourown companions-at-arms. But they were Saxons who robbed the chapel at St Bees of cup, candlestick and chalice, were they not?”“They were godless men,” answered Cedric.“Ay, and they drank out all the good wine and ale that lay in store for many a secret carousal, when ye pretend ye are but busiedwith vigils and primes!—Priest, thou art bound to revenge such sacrilege.”“I am indeed bound to vengeance,” murmured Cedric; “Saint Withold knows my heart.”Front-de-Bœuf, in the meanwhile, led the way to a postern, where, passing the moat on a single plank, they reached a smallbarbican, or exterior defence, which communicated with the open ﬁeld by a well-fortiﬁed sallyport.“Begone, then; and if thou wilt do mine errand, and if thou return hither when it is done, thou shalt see Saxon ﬂesh cheap as everwas hog’s in the shambles of Shefﬁeld. And, hark thee, thou seemest to be a jolly confessor—come hither after the onslaught, and thoushalt have as much Malvoisie as would drench thy whole convent.”“Assuredly we shall meet again,” answered Cedric.“Something in hand the whilst,” continued the Norman; and, as they parted at the postern door, he thrust into Cedric’s reluctanthand a gold byzant, adding, “Remember, I will ﬂy off both cowl and skin, if thou failest in thy purpose.”“And full leave will I give thee to do both,” answered Cedric, leaving the postern, and striding forth over the free ﬁeld with a joyfulstep, “if, when we meet next, I deserve not better at thine hand.”—Turning then back towards the castle, he threw the piece of goldtowards the donor, exclaiming at the same time, “False Norman, thy money perish with thee!”Front-de-Bœuf heard the words imperfectly, but the action was suspicious—“Archers,” he called to the warders on the outwardbattlements, “send me an arrow through yon monk’s frock!—yet stay,” he said, as his retainers were bending their bows, “it avails not—we must thus far trust him since we have no better shift. I think he dares not betray me—at the worst I can but treat with theseSaxon dogs whom I have safe in kennel.—Ho! Giles jailor, let them bring Cedric of Rotherwood before me, and the other churl, hiscompanion—him I mean of Coningsburgh—Athelstane there, or what call they him? Their very names are an encumbrance to aNorman knight’s mouth, and have, as it were, a ﬂavour of bacon—Give me a stoup of wine, as jolly Prince John said, that I may washaway the relish—place it in the armoury, and thither lead the prisoners.”His commands were obeyed; and, upon entering that Gothic apartment, hung with many spoils won by his own valour and that ofhis father, he found a ﬂagon of wine on the massive oaken table, and the two Saxon captives under the guard of four of his dependants.Front-de-Bœuf took a long drought of wine, and then addressed his prisoners;—for the manner in which Wamba drew the cap over hisface, the change of dress, the gloomy and broken light, and the Baron’s imperfect acquaintance with the features of Cedric, (whoavoided his Norman neighbours, and seldom stirred beyond his own domains,) prevented him from discovering that the mostimportant of his captives had made his escape.“Gallants of England,” said Front-de-Bœuf, “how relish ye your entertainment at Torquilstone?—Are ye yet aware what your‘surquedy’ and ‘outrecuidance’ 31 merit, for scofﬁng at the entertainment of a prince of the House of Anjou?—Have ye forgotten howye requited the unmerited hospitality of the royal John? By God and St Dennis, an ye pay not the richer ransom, I will hang ye up bythe feet from the iron bars of these windows, till the kites and hooded crows have made skeletons of you!—Speak out, ye Saxon dogs—what bid ye for your worthless lives?—How say you, you of Rotherwood?”“Not a doit I,” answered poor Wamba—“and for hanging up by the feet, my brain has been topsy-turvy, they say, ever since thebiggin was bound ﬁrst round my head; so turning me upside down may peradventure restore it again.”“Saint Genevieve!” said Front-de-Bœuf, “what have we got here?”And with the back of his hand he struck Cedric’s cap from the head of the Jester, and throwing open his collar, discovered the fatalbadge of servitude, the silver collar round his neck.“Giles—Clement—dogs and varlets!” exclaimed the furious Norman, “what have you brought me here?”“I think I can tell you,” said De Bracy, who just entered the apartment. “This is Cedric’s clown, who fought so manful a skirmishwith Isaac of York about a question of precedence.”“I shall settle it for them both,” replied Front-de-Bœuf; “they shall hang on the same gallows, unless his master and this boar ofConingsburgh will pay well for their lives. Their wealth is the least they can surrender; they must also carry off with them the swarmsthat are besetting the castle, subscribe a surrender of their pretended immunities, and live under us as serfs and vassals; too happy if, inthe new world that is about to begin, we leave them the breath of their nostrils.—Go,” said he to two of his attendants, “fetch me theright Cedric hither, and I pardon your error for once; the rather that you but mistook a fool for a Saxon franklin.”“Ay, but,” said Wamba, “your chivalrous excellency will ﬁnd there are more fools than franklins among us.”“What means the knave?” said Front-de-Bœuf, looking towards his followers, who, lingering and loath, faltered forth their belief,that if this were not Cedric who was there in presence, they knew not what was become of him.“Saints of Heaven!” exclaimed De Bracy, “he must have escaped in the monk’s garments!”“Fiends of hell!” echoed Front-de-Bœuf, “it was then the boar of Rotherwood whom I ushered to the postern, and dismissed withmy own hands!—And thou,” he said to Wamba, “whose folly could overreach the wisdom of idiots yet more gross than thyself—I willgive thee holy orders—I will shave thy crown for thee!—Here, let them tear the scalp from his head, and then pitch him headlongfrom the battlements—Thy trade is to jest, canst thou jest now?”“You deal with me better than your word, noble knight,” whimpered forth poor Wamba, whose habits of buffoonery were not to beovercome even by the immediate prospect of death; “if you give me the red cap you propose, out of a simple monk you will make acardinal.”“The poor wretch,” said De Bracy, “is resolved to die in his vocation.—Front-de-Bœuf, you shall not slay him. Give him to me tomake sport for my Free Companions.—How sayst thou, knave? Wilt thou take heart of grace, and go to the wars with me?”“Ay, with my master’s leave,” said Wamba; “for, look you, I must not slip collar” (and he touched that which he wore) “without hispermission.”“Oh, a Norman saw will soon cut a Saxon collar.” said De Bracy.“Ay, noble sir,” said Wamba, “and thence goes the proverb—‘Norman saw on English oak,On English neck a Norman yoke;Norman spoon in English dish,And England ruled as Normans wish;Blithe world to England never will be more,Till England’s rid of all the four.’”“Thou dost well, De Bracy,” said Front-de-Bœuf, “to stand there listening to a fool’s jargon, when destruction is gaping for us!Seest thou not we are overreached, and that our proposed mode of communicating with our friends without has been disconcerted bythis same motley gentleman thou art so fond to brother? What views have we to expect but instant storm?”“To the battlements then,” said De Bracy; “when didst thou ever see me the graver for the thoughts of battle? Call the Templaryonder, and let him ﬁght but half so well for his life as he has done for his Order—Make thou to the walls thyself with thy huge body—Let me do my poor endeavour in my own way, and I tell thee the Saxon outlaws may as well attempt to scale the clouds, as thecastle of Torquilstone; or, if you will treat with the banditti, why not employ the mediation of this worthy franklin, who seems in suchdeep contemplation of the wine-ﬂagon?—Here, Saxon,” he continued, addressing Athelstane, and handing the cup to him, “rinse thythroat with that noble liquor, and rouse up thy soul to say what thou wilt do for thy liberty.”“What a man of mould may,” answered Athelstane, “providing it be what a man of manhood ought.—Dismiss me free, with mycompanions, and I will pay a ransom of a thousand marks.”“And wilt moreover assure us the retreat of that scum of mankind who are swarming around the castle, contrary to God’s peace andthe king’s?” said Front-de-Bœuf.“In so far as I can,” answered Athelstane, “I will withdraw them; and I fear not but that my father Cedric will do his best to assistme.”“We are agreed then,” said Front-de-Bœuf—“thou and they are to be set at freedom, and peace is to be on both sides, for payment ofa thousand marks. It is a triﬂing ransom, Saxon, and thou wilt owe gratitude to the moderation which accepts of it in exchange of yourpersons. But mark, this extends not to the Jew Isaac.”“Nor to the Jew Isaac’s daughter,” said the Templar, who had now joined them.“Neither,” said Front-de-Bœuf, “belong to this Saxon’s company.”“I were unworthy to be called Christian, if they did,” replied Athelstane: “deal with the unbelievers as ye list.”“Neither does the ransom include the Lady Rowena,” said De Bracy. “It shall never be said I was scared out of a fair prize withoutstriking a blow for it.”“Neither,” said Front-de-Bœuf, “does our treaty refer to this wretched Jester, whom I retain, that I may make him an example toevery knave who turns jest into earnest.”“The Lady Rowena,” answered Athelstane, with the most steady countenance, “is my afﬁanced bride. I will be drawn by wildhorses before I consent to part with her. The slave Wamba has this day saved the life of my father Cedric—I will lose mine ere a hairof his head be injured.”“Thy afﬁanced bride?—The Lady Rowena the afﬁanced bride of a vassal like thee?” said De Bracy; “Saxon, thou dreamest that thedays of thy seven kingdoms are returned again. I tell thee, the Princes of the House of Anjou confer not their wards on men of suchlineage as thine.”“My lineage, proud Norman,” replied Athelstane, “is drawn from a source more pure and ancient than that of a beggarlyFrenchman, whose living is won by selling the blood of the thieves whom he assembles under his paltry standard. Kings were myancestors, strong in war and wise in council, who every day feasted in their hall more hundreds than thou canst number individualfollowers; whose names have been sung by minstrels, and their laws recorded by Wittenagemotes; whose bones were interred amid theprayers of saints, and over whose tombs minsters have been builded.”“Thou hast it, De Bracy,” said Front-de-Bœuf, well pleased with the rebuff which his companion had received; “the Saxon hath hitthee fairly.”“As fairly as a captive can strike,” said De Bracy, with apparent carelessness; “for he whose hands are tied should have his tongue atfreedom.—But thy glibness of reply, comrade,” rejoined he, speaking to Athelstane, “will not win the freedom of the Lady Rowena.”To this Athelstane, who had already made a longer speech than was his custom to do on any topic, however interesting, returned noanswer. The conversation was interrupted by the arrival of a menial, who announced that a monk demanded admittance at the posterngate.“In the name of Saint Bennet, the prince of these bull-beggars,” said Front-de-Bœuf, “have we a real monk this time, or anotherimpostor? Search him, slaves—for an ye suffer a second impostor to be palmed upon you, I will have your eyes torn out, and hot coalsput into the sockets.”“Let me endure the extremity of your anger, my lord,” said Giles, “if this be not a real shaveling. Your squire Jocelyn knows himwell, and will vouch him to be brother Ambrose, a monk in attendance upon the Prior of Jorvaulx.”“Admit him,” said Front-de-Bœuf; “most likely he brings us news from his jovial master. Surely the devil keeps holiday, and thepriests are relieved from duty, that they are strolling thus wildly through the country. Remove these prisoners; and, Saxon, think onwhat thou hast heard.”“I claim,” said Athelstane, “an honourable imprisonment, with due care of my board and of my couch, as becomes my rank, and asis due to one who is in treaty for ransom. Moreover, I hold him that deems himself the best of you, bound to answer to me with hisbody for this aggression on my freedom. This deﬁance hath already been sent to thee by thy sewer; thou underliest it, and art bound toanswer me—There lies my glove.”“I answer not the challenge of my prisoner,” said Front-de-Bœuf; “nor shalt thou, Maurice de Bracy.—Giles,” he continued, “hangthe franklin’s glove upon the tine of yonder branched antlers: there shall it remain until he is a free man. Should he then presume todemand it, or to afﬁrm he was unlawfully made my prisoner, by the belt of Saint Christopher, he will speak to one who hath neverrefused to meet a foe on foot or on horseback, alone or with his vassals at his back!”The Saxon prisoners were accordingly removed, just as they introduced the monk Ambrose, who appeared to be in greatperturbation.“This is the real ‘Deus vobiscum’,” said Wamba, as he passed the reverend brother; “the others were but counterfeits.”“Holy Mother,” said the monk, as he addressed the assembled knights, “I am at last safe and in Christian keeping!”“Safe thou art,” replied De Bracy; “and for Christianity, here is the stout Baron Reginald Front-de-Bœuf, whose utter abomination isa Jew; and the good Knight Templar, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, whose trade is to slay Saracens—If these are not good marks ofChristianity, I know no other which they bear about them.”“Ye are friends and allies of our reverend father in God, Aymer, Prior of Jorvaulx,” said the monk, without noticing the tone of DeBracy’s reply; “ye owe him aid both by knightly faith and holy charity; for what saith the blessed Saint Augustin, in his treatise ‘DeCivitate Dei’—-”“What saith the devil!” interrupted Front-de-Bœuf; “or rather what dost thou say, Sir Priest? We have little time to hear texts fromthe holy fathers.”“‘Sancta Maria!’” ejaculated Father Ambrose, “how prompt to ire are these unhallowed laymen!—But be it known to you, braveknights, that certain murderous caitiffs, casting behind them fear of God, and reverence of his church, and not regarding the bull of theholy see, ‘Si quis, suadende Diabolo’—”“Brother priest,” said the Templar, “all this we know or guess at—tell us plainly, is thy master, the Prior, made prisoner, and towhom?”“Surely,” said Ambrose, “he is in the hands of the men of Belial, infesters of these woods, and contemners of the holy text, ‘Touchnot mine anointed, and do my prophets naught of evil.’”“Here is a new argument for our swords, sirs,” said Front-de-Bœuf, turning to his companions; “and so, instead of reaching us anyassistance, the Prior of Jorvaulx requests aid at our hands? a man is well helped of these lazy churchmen when he hath most to do!—But speak out, priest, and say at once, what doth thy master expect from us?”“So please you,” said Ambrose, “violent hands having been imposed on my reverend superior, contrary to the holy ordinance whichI did already quote, and the men of Belial having riﬂed his mails and budgets, and stripped him of two hundred marks of pure reﬁnedgold, they do yet demand of him a large sum beside, ere they will suffer him to depart from their uncircumcised hands. Wherefore thereverend father in God prays you, as his dear friends, to rescue him, either by paying down the ransom at which they hold him, or byforce of arms, at your best discretion.”“The foul ﬁend quell the Prior!” said Front-de-Bœuf; “his morning’s drought has been a deep one. When did thy master hear of aNorman baron unbuckling his purse to relieve a churchman, whose bags are ten times as weighty as ours?—And how can we do aughtby valour to free him, that are cooped up here by ten times our number, and expect an assault every moment?”“And that was what I was about to tell you,” said the monk, “had your hastiness allowed me time. But, God help me, I am old, andthese foul onslaughts distract an aged man’s brain. Nevertheless, it is of verity that they assemble a camp, and raise a bank against thewalls of this castle.”“To the battlements!” cried De Bracy, “and let us mark what these knaves do without;” and so saying, he opened a latticed windowwhich led to a sort of bartisan or projecting balcony, and immediately called from thence to those in the apartment—“Saint Dennis,but the old monk hath brought true tidings!—They bring forward mantelets and pavisses, 32 and the archers muster on the skirts of thewood like a dark cloud before a hailstorm.”Reginald Front-de-Bœuf also looked out upon the ﬁeld, and immediately snatched his bugle; and, after winding a long and loudblast, commanded his men to their posts on the walls.“De Bracy, look to the eastern side, where the walls are lowest—Noble Bois-Guilbert, thy trade hath well taught thee how to attackand defend, look thou to the western side—I myself will take post at the barbican. Yet, do not conﬁne your exertions to any one spot,noble friends!—we must this day be everywhere, and multiply ourselves, were it possible, so as to carry by our presence succour andrelief wherever the attack is hottest. Our numbers are few, but activity and courage may supply that defect, since we have only to dowith rascal clowns.”“But, noble knights,” exclaimed Father Ambrose, amidst the bustle and confusion occasioned by the preparations for defence, “willnone of ye hear the message of the reverend father in God Aymer, Prior of Jorvaulx?—I beseech thee to hear me, noble Sir Reginald!”“Go patter thy petitions to heaven,” said the ﬁerce Norman, “for we on earth have no time to listen to them.—Ho! there, Anselm Isee that seething pitch and oil are ready to pour on the heads of these audacious traitors—Look that the cross-bowmen lack not bolts.33—Fling abroad my banner with the old bull’s head—the knaves shall soon ﬁnd with whom they have to do this day!”“But, noble sir,” continued the monk, persevering in his endeavours to draw attention, “consider my vow of obedience, and let medischarge myself of my Superior’s errand.”“Away with this prating dotard,” said Front-de Bœuf, “lock him up in the chapel, to tell his beads till the broil be over. It will be anew thing to the saints in Torquilstone to hear aves and paters; they have not been so honoured, I trow, since they were cut out ofstone.”“Blaspheme not the holy saints, Sir Reginald,” said De Bracy, “we shall have need of their aid to-day before yon rascal routdisband.”“I expect little aid from their hand,” said Front-de-Bœuf, “unless we were to hurl them from the battlements on the heads of thevillains. There is a huge lumbering Saint Christopher yonder, sufﬁcient to bear a whole company to the earth.”The Templar had in the meantime been looking out on the proceedings of the besiegers, with rather more attention than the brutalFront-de-Bœuf or his giddy companion.“By the faith of mine order,” he said, “these men approach with more touch of discipline than could have been judged, howeverthey come by it. See ye how dexterously they avail themselves of every cover which a tree or bush affords, and shun exposingthemselves to the shot of our cross-bows? I spy neither banner nor pennon among them, and yet will I gage my golden chain, that theyare led on by some noble knight or gentleman, skilful in the practice of wars.”“I espy him,” said De Bracy; “I see the waving of a knight’s crest, and the gleam of his armour. See yon tall man in the black mail,who is busied marshalling the farther troop of the rascaille yeomen—by Saint Dennis, I hold him to be the same whom we called ‘LeNoir Faineant’, who overthrew thee, Front-de-Bœuf, in the lists at Ashby.”“So much the better,” said Front-de-Bœuf, “that he comes here to give me my revenge. Some hilding fellow he must be, who darednot stay to assert his claim to the tourney prize which chance had assigned him. I should in vain have sought for him where knightsand nobles seek their foes, and right glad am I he hath here shown himself among yon villain yeomanry.”The demonstrations of the enemy’s immediate approach cut off all farther discourse. Each knight repaired to his post, and at thehead of the few followers whom they were able to muster, and who were in numbers inadequate to defend the whole extent of thewalls, they awaited with calm determination the threatened assault.CHAPTER XXVIIIThis wandering race, sever’d from other men,Boast yet their intercourse with human arts;The seas, the woods, the deserts, which they haunt,Find them acquainted with their secret treasures:And unregarded herbs, and ﬂowers, and blossoms,Display undreamt-of powers when gather’d by them.THE JEWOur history must needs retrograde for the space of a few pages, to inform the reader of certain passages material to hisunderstanding the rest of this important narrative. His own intelligence may indeed have easily anticipated that, when Ivanhoe sunkdown, and seemed abandoned by all the world, it was the importunity of Rebecca which prevailed on her father to have the gallantyoung warrior transported from the lists to the house which for the time the Jews inhabited in the suburbs of Ashby.It would not have been difﬁcult to have persuaded Isaac to this step in any other circumstances, for his disposition was kind andgrateful. But he had also the prejudices and scrupulous timidity of his persecuted people, and those were to be conquered.“Holy Abraham!” he exclaimed, “he is a good youth, and my heart bleeds to see the gore trickle down his rich embroideredhacqueton, and his corslet of goodly price—but to carry him to our house!—damsel, hast thou well considered?—he is a Christian,and by our law we may not deal with the stranger and Gentile, save for the advantage of our commerce.”“Speak not so, my dear father,” replied Rebecca; “we may not indeed mix with them in banquet and in jollity; but in wounds and inmisery, the Gentile becometh the Jew’s brother.”“I would I knew what the Rabbi Jacob Ben Tudela would opine on it,” replied Isaac;—“nevertheless, the good youth must not bleedto death. Let Seth and Reuben bear him to Ashby.”“Nay, let them place him in my litter,” said Rebecca; “I will mount one of the palfreys.”“That were to expose thee to the gaze of those dogs of Ishmael and of Edom,” whispered Isaac, with a suspicious glance towardsthe crowd of knights and squires. But Rebecca was already busied in carrying her charitable purpose into effect, and listed not what hesaid, until Isaac, seizing the sleeve of her mantle, again exclaimed, in a hurried voice—“Beard of Aaron!—what if the youth perish!—if he die in our custody, shall we not be held guilty of his blood, and be torn to pieces by the multitude?”“He will not die, my father,” said Rebecca, gently extricating herself from the grasp of Isaac “he will not die unless we abandonhim; and if so, we are indeed answerable for his blood to God and to man.”“Nay,” said Isaac, releasing his hold, “it grieveth me as much to see the drops of his blood, as if they were so many golden byzantsfrom mine own purse; and I well know, that the lessons of Miriam, daughter of the Rabbi Manasses of Byzantium whose soul is inParadise, have made thee skilful in the art of healing, and that thou knowest the craft of herbs, and the force of elixirs. Therefore, do asthy mind giveth thee—thou art a good damsel, a blessing, and a crown, and a song of rejoicing unto me and unto my house, and untothe people of my fathers.”The apprehensions of Isaac, however, were not ill founded; and the generous and grateful benevolence of his daughter exposed her,on her return to Ashby, to the unhallowed gaze of Brian de Bois-Guilbert. The Templar twice passed and repassed them on the road,ﬁxing his bold and ardent look on the beautiful Jewess; and we have already seen the consequences of the admiration which hercharms excited when accident threw her into the power of that unprincipled voluptuary.Rebecca lost no time in causing the patient to be transported to their temporary dwelling, and proceeded with her own hands toexamine and to bind up his wounds. The youngest reader of romances and romantic ballads, must recollect how often the females,during the dark ages, as they are called, were initiated into the mysteries of surgery, and how frequently the gallant knight submittedthe wounds of his person to her cure, whose eyes had yet more deeply penetrated his heart.But the Jews, both male and female, possessed and practised the medical science in all its branches, and the monarchs and powerfulbarons of the time frequently committed themselves to the charge of some experienced sage among this despised people, whenwounded or in sickness. The aid of the Jewish physicians was not the less eagerly sought after, though a general belief prevailedamong the Christians, that the Jewish Rabbins were deeply acquainted with the occult sciences, and particularly with the cabalisticalart, which had its name and origin in the studies of the sages of Israel. Neither did the Rabbins disown such acquaintance withsupernatural arts, which added nothing (for what could add aught?) to the hatred with which their nation was regarded, while itdiminished the contempt with which that malevolence was mingled. A Jewish magician might be the subject of equal abhorrence witha Jewish usurer, but he could not be equally despised. It is besides probable, considering the wonderful cures they are said to haveperformed, that the Jews possessed some secrets of the healing art peculiar to themselves, and which, with the exclusive spirit arisingout of their condition, they took great care to conceal from the Christians amongst whom they dwelt.The beautiful Rebecca had been heedfully brought up in all the knowledge proper to her nation, which her apt and powerful mindhad retained, arranged, and enlarged, in the course of a progress beyond her years, her sex, and even the age in which she lived. Herknowledge of medicine and of the healing art had been acquired under an aged Jewess, the daughter of one of their most celebrateddoctors, who loved Rebecca as her own child, and was believed to have communicated to her secrets, which had been left to herself byher sage father at the same time, and under the same circumstances. The fate of Miriam had indeed been to fall a sacriﬁce to thefanaticism of the times; but her secrets had survived in her apt pupil.Rebecca, thus endowed with knowledge as with beauty, was universally revered and admired by her own tribe, who almost regardedher as one of those gifted women mentioned in the sacred history. Her father himself, out of reverence for her talents, whichinvoluntarily mingled itself with his unbounded affection, permitted the maiden a greater liberty than was usually indulged to those ofher sex by the habits of her people, and was, as we have just seen, frequently guided by her opinion, even in preference to his own.When Ivanhoe reached the habitation of Isaac, he was still in a state of unconsciousness, owing to the profuse loss of blood whichhad taken place during his exertions in the lists. Rebecca examined the wound, and having applied to it such vulnerary remedies as herart prescribed, informed her father that if fever could be averted, of which the great bleeding rendered her little apprehensive, and ifthe healing balsam of Miriam retained its virtue, there was nothing to fear for his guest’s life, and that he might with safety travel toYork with them on the ensuing day. Isaac looked a little blank at this annunciation. His charity would willingly have stopped short atAshby, or at most would have left the wounded Christian to be tended in the house where he was residing at present, with an assuranceto the Hebrew to whom it belonged, that all expenses should be duly discharged. To this, however, Rebecca opposed many reasons, ofwhich we shall only mention two that had peculiar weight with Isaac. The one was, that she would on no account put the phial ofprecious balsam into the hands of another physician even of her own tribe, lest that valuable mystery should be discovered; the other,that this wounded knight, Wilfred of Ivanhoe, was an intimate favourite of Richard Cœur-de-Lion, and that, in case the monarchshould return, Isaac, who had supplied his brother John with treasure to prosecute his rebellious purposes, would stand in no smallneed of a powerful protector who enjoyed Richard’s favour.“Thou art speaking but sooth, Rebecca,” said Isaac, giving way to these weighty arguments—“it were an offending of Heaven tobetray the secrets of the blessed Miriam; for the good which Heaven giveth, is not rashly to be squandered upon others, whether it betalents of gold and shekels of silver, or whether it be the secret mysteries of a wise physician—assuredly they should be preserved tothose to whom Providence hath vouchsafed them. And him whom the Nazarenes of England call the Lion’s Heart, assuredly it werebetter for me to fall into the hands of a strong lion of Idumea than into his, if he shall have got assurance of my dealing with hisbrother. Wherefore I will lend ear to thy counsel, and this youth shall journey with us unto York, and our house shall be as a home tohim until his wounds shall be healed. And if he of the Lion Heart shall return to the land, as is now noised abroad, then shall thisWilfred of Ivanhoe be unto me as a wall of defence, when the king’s displeasure shall burn high against thy father. And if he doth notreturn, this Wilfred may natheless repay us our charges when he shall gain treasure by the strength of his spear and of his sword, evenas he did yesterday and this day also. For the youth is a good youth, and keepeth the day which he appointeth, and restoreth that whichhe borroweth, and succoureth the Israelite, even the child of my father’s house, when he is encompassed by strong thieves and sons ofBelial.”It was not until evening was nearly closed that Ivanhoe was restored to consciousness of his situation. He awoke from a brokenslumber, under the confused impressions which are naturally attendant on the recovery from a state of insensibility. He was unable forsome time to recall exactly to memory the circumstances which had preceded his fall in the lists, or to make out any connected chainof the events in which he had been engaged upon the yesterday. A sense of wounds and injury, joined to great weakness andexhaustion, was mingled with the recollection of blows dealt and received, of steeds rushing upon each other, overthrowing andoverthrown—of shouts and clashing of arms, and all the heady tumult of a confused ﬁght. An effort to draw aside the curtain of hiscouch was in some degree successful, although rendered difﬁcult by the pain of his wound.To his great surprise he found himself in a room magniﬁcently furnished, but having cushions instead of chairs to rest upon, and inother respects partaking so much of Oriental costume, that he began to doubt whether he had not, during his sleep, been transportedback again to the land of Palestine. The impression was increased, when, the tapestry being drawn aside, a female form, dressed in arich habit, which partook more of the Eastern taste than that of Europe, glided through the door which it concealed, and was followedby a swarthy domestic.As the wounded knight was about to address this fair apparition, she imposed silence by placing her slender ﬁnger upon her rubylips, while the attendant, approaching him, proceeded to uncover Ivanhoe’s side, and the lovely Jewess satisﬁed herself that thebandage was in its place, and the wound doing well. She performed her task with a graceful and digniﬁed simplicity and modesty,which might, even in more civilized days, have served to redeem it from whatever might seem repugnant to female delicacy. The ideaof so young and beautiful a person engaged in attendance on a sick-bed, or in dressing the wound of one of a different sex, was meltedaway and lost in that of a beneﬁcent being contributing her effectual aid to relieve pain, and to avert the stroke of death. Rebecca’s fewand brief directions were given in the Hebrew language to the old domestic; and he, who had been frequently her assistant in similarcases, obeyed them without reply.The accents of an unknown tongue, however harsh they might have sounded when uttered by another, had, coming from thebeautiful Rebecca, the romantic and pleasing effect which fancy ascribes to the charms pronounced by some beneﬁcent fairy,unintelligible, indeed, to the ear, but, from the sweetness of utterance, and benignity of aspect, which accompanied them, touching andaffecting to the heart. Without making an attempt at further question, Ivanhoe suffered them in silence to take the measures theythought most proper for his recovery; and it was not until those were completed, and this kind physician about to retire, that hiscuriosity could no longer be suppressed.—“Gentle maiden,” he began in the Arabian tongue, with which his Eastern travels hadrendered him familiar, and which he thought most likely to be understood by the turban’d and caftan’d damsel who stood before him—“I pray you, gentle maiden, of your courtesy—-”But here he was interrupted by his fair physician, a smile which she could scarce suppress dimpling for an instant a face, whosegeneral expression was that of contemplative melancholy. “I am of England, Sir Knight, and speak the English tongue, although mydress and my lineage belong to another climate.”“Noble damsel,”—again the Knight of Ivanhoe began; and again Rebecca hastened to interrupt him.“Bestow not on me, Sir Knight,” she said, “the epithet of noble. It is well you should speedily know that your handmaiden is a poorJewess, the daughter of that Isaac of York, to whom you were so lately a good and kind lord. It well becomes him, and those of hishousehold, to render to you such careful tendance as your present state necessarily demands.”I know not whether the fair Rowena would have been altogether satisﬁed with the species of emotion with which her devoted knighthad hitherto gazed on the beautiful features, and fair form, and lustrous eyes, of the lovely Rebecca; eyes whose brilliancy was shaded,and, as it were, mellowed, by the fringe of her long silken eyelashes, and which a minstrel would have compared to the evening stardarting its rays through a bower of jessamine. But Ivanhoe was too good a Catholic to retain the same class of feelings towards aJewess. This Rebecca had foreseen, and for this very purpose she had hastened to mention her father’s name and lineage; yet—for thefair and wise daughter of Isaac was not without a touch of female weakness—she could not but sigh internally when the glance ofrespectful admiration, not altogether unmixed with tenderness, with which Ivanhoe had hitherto regarded his unknown benefactress,was exchanged at once for a manner cold, composed, and collected, and fraught with no deeper feeling than that which expressed agrateful sense of courtesy received from an unexpected quarter, and from one of an inferior race. It was not that Ivanhoe’s formercarriage expressed more than that general devotional homage which youth always pays to beauty; yet it was mortifying that one wordshould operate as a spell to remove poor Rebecca, who could not be supposed altogether ignorant of her title to such homage, into adegraded class, to whom it could not be honourably rendered.But the gentleness and candour of Rebecca’s nature imputed no fault to Ivanhoe for sharing in the universal prejudices of his ageand religion. On the contrary the fair Jewess, though sensible her patient now regarded her as one of a race of reprobation, with whomit was disgraceful to hold any beyond the most necessary intercourse, ceased not to pay the same patient and devoted attention to hissafety and convalescence. She informed him of the necessity they were under of removing to York, and of her father’s resolution totransport him thither, and tend him in his own house until his health should be restored. Ivanhoe expressed great repugnance to thisplan, which he grounded on unwillingness to give farther trouble to his benefactors.“Was there not,” he said, “in Ashby, or near it, some Saxon franklin, or even some wealthy peasant, who would endure the burdenof a wounded countryman’s residence with him until he should be again able to bear his armour?—Was there no convent of Saxonendowment, where he could be received?—Or could he not be transported as far as Burton, where he was sure to ﬁnd hospitality withWaltheoff, the Abbot of St Withold’s, to whom he was related?”“Any, the worst of these harbourages,” said Rebecca, with a melancholy smile, “would unquestionably be more ﬁtting for yourresidence than the abode of a despised Jew; yet, Sir Knight, unless you would dismiss your physician, you cannot change yourlodging. Our nation, as you well know, can cure wounds, though we deal not in inﬂicting them; and in our own family, in particular,are secrets which have been handed down since the days of Solomon, and of which you have already experienced the advantages. NoNazarene—I crave your forgiveness, Sir Knight—no Christian leech, within the four seas of Britain, could enable you to bear yourcorslet within a month.”“And how soon wilt THOU enable me to brook it?” said Ivanhoe, impatiently.“Within eight days, if thou wilt be patient and conformable to my directions,” replied Rebecca.“By Our Blessed Lady,” said Wilfred, “if it be not a sin to name her here, it is no time for me or any true knight to be bedridden; andif thou accomplish thy promise, maiden, I will pay thee with my casque full of crowns, come by them as I may.”“I will accomplish my promise,” said Rebecca, “and thou shalt bear thine armour on the eighth day from hence, if thou will grantme but one boon in the stead of the silver thou dost promise me.”“If it be within my power, and such as a true Christian knight may yield to one of thy people,” replied Ivanhoe, “I will grant thyboon blithely and thankfully.”“Nay,” answered Rebecca, “I will but pray of thee to believe henceforward that a Jew may do good service to a Christian, withoutdesiring other guerdon than the blessing of the Great Father who made both Jew and Gentile.”“It were sin to doubt it, maiden,” replied Ivanhoe; “and I repose myself on thy skill without further scruple or question, well trustingyou will enable me to bear my corslet on the eighth day. And now, my kind leech, let me enquire of the news abroad. What of thenoble Saxon Cedric and his household?—what of the lovely Lady—” He stopt, as if unwilling to speak Rowena’s name in the houseof a Jew—“Of her, I mean, who was named Queen of the tournament?”“And who was selected by you, Sir Knight, to hold that dignity, with judgment which was admired as much as your valour,” repliedRebecca.The blood which Ivanhoe had lost did not prevent a ﬂush from crossing his cheek, feeling that he had incautiously betrayed a deepinterest in Rowena by the awkward attempt he had made to conceal it.“It was less of her I would speak,” said he, “than of Prince John; and I would fain know somewhat of a faithful squire, and why henow attends me not?”“Let me use my authority as a leech,” answered Rebecca, “and enjoin you to keep silence, and avoid agitating reﬂections, whilst Iapprize you of what you desire to know. Prince John hath broken off the tournament, and set forward in all haste towards York, withthe nobles, knights, and churchmen of his party, after collecting such sums as they could wring, by fair means or foul, from those whoare esteemed the wealthy of the land. It is said he designs to assume his brother’s crown.”“Not without a blow struck in its defence,” said Ivanhoe, raising himself upon the couch, “if there were but one true subject inEngland I will ﬁght for Richard’s title with the best of them—ay, one or two, in his just quarrel!”“But that you may be able to do so,” said Rebecca touching his shoulder with her hand, “you must now observe my directions, andremain quiet.”“True, maiden,” said Ivanhoe, “as quiet as these disquieted times will permit—And of Cedric and his household?”“His steward came but brief while since,” said the Jewess, “panting with haste, to ask my father for certain monies, the price ofwool the growth of Cedric’s ﬂocks, and from him I learned that Cedric and Athelstane of Coningsburgh had left Prince John’s lodgingin high displeasure, and were about to set forth on their return homeward.”“Went any lady with them to the banquet?” said Wilfred.“The Lady Rowena,” said Rebecca, answering the question with more precision than it had been asked—“The Lady Rowena wentnot to the Prince’s feast, and, as the steward reported to us, she is now on her journey back to Rotherwood, with her guardian Cedric.And touching your faithful squire Gurth—-”“Ha!” exclaimed the knight, “knowest thou his name?—But thou dost,” he immediately added, “and well thou mayst, for it wasfrom thy hand, and, as I am now convinced, from thine own generosity of spirit, that he received but yesterday a hundred zecchins.”“Speak not of that,” said Rebecca, blushing deeply; “I see how easy it is for the tongue to betray what the heart would gladlyconceal.”“But this sum of gold,” said Ivanhoe, gravely, “my honour is concerned in repaying it to your father.”“Let it be as thou wilt,” said Rebecca, “when eight days have passed away; but think not, and speak not now, of aught that mayretard thy recovery.”“Be it so, kind maiden,” said Ivanhoe; “I were most ungrateful to dispute thy commands. But one word of the fate of poor Gurth,and I have done with questioning thee.”“I grieve to tell thee, Sir Knight,” answered the Jewess, “that he is in custody by the order of Cedric.”—And then observing thedistress which her communication gave to Wilfred, she instantly added, “But the steward Oswald said, that if nothing occurred torenew his master’s displeasure against him, he was sure that Cedric would pardon Gurth, a faithful serf, and one who stood high infavour, and who had but committed this error out of the love which he bore to Cedric’s son. And he said, moreover, that he and hiscomrades, and especially Wamba the Jester, were resolved to warn Gurth to make his escape by the way, in case Cedric’s ire againsthim could not be mitigated.”“Would to God they may keep their purpose!” said Ivanhoe; “but it seems as if I were destined to bring ruin on whomsoever hathshown kindness to me. My king, by whom I was honoured and distinguished, thou seest that the brother most indebted to him israising his arms to grasp his crown;—my regard hath brought restraint and trouble on the fairest of her sex;—and now my father in hismood may slay this poor bondsman but for his love and loyal service to me!—Thou seest, maiden, what an ill-fated wretch thou dostlabour to assist; be wise, and let me go, ere the misfortunes which track my footsteps like slot-hounds, shall involve thee also in theirpursuit.”“Nay,” said Rebecca, “thy weakness and thy grief, Sir Knight, make thee miscalculate the purposes of Heaven. Thou hast beenrestored to thy country when it most needed the assistance of a strong hand and a true heart, and thou hast humbled the pride of thineenemies and those of thy king, when their horn was most highly exalted, and for the evil which thou hast sustained, seest thou not thatHeaven has raised thee a helper and a physician, even among the most despised of the land?—Therefore, be of good courage, and trustthat thou art preserved for some marvel which thine arm shall work before this people. Adieu—and having taken the medicine which Ishall send thee by the hand of Reuben, compose thyself again to rest, that thou mayest be the more able to endure the journey on thesucceeding day.”Ivanhoe was convinced by the reasoning, and obeyed the directions, of Rebecca. The drought which Reuben administered was of asedative and narcotic quality, and secured the patient sound and undisturbed slumbers. In the morning his kind physician found himentirely free from feverish symptoms, and ﬁt to undergo the fatigue of a journey.He was deposited in the horse-litter which had brought him from the lists, and every precaution taken for his travelling with ease. Inone circumstance only even the entreaties of Rebecca were unable to secure sufﬁcient attention to the accommodation of the woundedknight. Isaac, like the enriched traveller of Juvenal’s tenth satire, had ever the fear of robbery before his eyes, conscious that he wouldbe alike accounted fair game by the marauding Norman noble, and by the Saxon outlaw. He therefore journeyed at a great rate, andmade short halts, and shorter repasts, so that he passed by Cedric and Athelstane who had several hours the start of him, but who hadbeen delayed by their protracted feasting at the convent of Saint Withold’s. Yet such was the virtue of Miriam’s balsam, or such thestrength of Ivanhoe’s constitution, that he did not sustain from the hurried journey that inconvenience which his kind physician hadapprehended.In another point of view, however, the Jew’s haste proved somewhat more than good speed. The rapidity with which he insisted ontravelling, bred several disputes between him and the party whom he had hired to attend him as a guard. These men were Saxons, andnot free by any means from the national love of ease and good living which the Normans stigmatized as laziness and gluttony.Reversing Shylock’s position, they had accepted the employment in hopes of feeding upon the wealthy Jew, and were very muchdispleased when they found themselves disappointed, by the rapidity with which he insisted on their proceeding. They remonstratedalso upon the risk of damage to their horses by these forced marches. Finally, there arose betwixt Isaac and his satellites a deadly feud,concerning the quantity of wine and ale to be allowed for consumption at each meal. And thus it happened, that when the alarm ofdanger approached, and that which Isaac feared was likely to come upon him, he was deserted by the discontented mercenaries onwhose protection he had relied, without using the means necessary to secure their attachment.In this deplorable condition the Jew, with his daughter and her wounded patient, were found by Cedric, as has already been noticed,and soon afterwards fell into the power of De Bracy and his confederates. Little notice was at ﬁrst taken of the horse-litter, and itmight have remained behind but for the curiosity of De Bracy, who looked into it under the impression that it might contain the objectof his enterprise, for Rowena had not unveiled herself. But De Bracy’s astonishment was considerable, when he discovered that thelitter contained a wounded man, who, conceiving himself to have fallen into the power of Saxon outlaws, with whom his name mightbe a protection for himself and his friends, frankly avowed himself to be Wilfred of Ivanhoe.The ideas of chivalrous honour, which, amidst his wildness and levity, never utterly abandoned De Bracy, prohibited him fromdoing the knight any injury in his defenceless condition, and equally interdicted his betraying him to Front-de-Bœuf, who would havehad no scruples to put to death, under any circumstances, the rival claimant of the ﬁef of Ivanhoe. On the other hand, to liberate asuitor preferred by the Lady Rowena, as the events of the tournament, and indeed Wilfred’s previous banishment from his father’shouse, had made matter of notoriety, was a pitch far above the ﬂight of De Bracy’s generosity. A middle course betwixt good and evilwas all which he found himself capable of adopting, and he commanded two of his own squires to keep close by the litter, and tosuffer no one to approach it. If questioned, they were directed by their master to say, that the empty litter of the Lady Rowena wasemployed to transport one of their comrades who had been wounded in the scufﬂe. On arriving at Torquilstone, while the KnightTemplar and the lord of that castle were each intent upon their own schemes, the one on the Jew’s treasure, and the other on hisdaughter, De Bracy’s squires conveyed Ivanhoe, still under the name of a wounded comrade, to a distant apartment. This explanationwas accordingly returned by these men to Front-de-Bœuf, when he questioned them why they did not make for the battlements uponthe alarm.“A wounded companion!” he replied in great wrath and astonishment. “No wonder that churls and yeomen wax so presumptuous aseven to lay leaguer before castles, and that clowns and swineherds send deﬁances to nobles, since men-at-arms have turned sick men’snurses, and Free Companions are grown keepers of dying folk’s curtains, when the castle is about to be assailed.—To the battlements,ye loitering villains!” he exclaimed, raising his stentorian voice till the arches around rung again, “to the battlements, or I will splinteryour bones with this truncheon!”The men sulkily replied, “that they desired nothing better than to go to the battlements, providing Front-de-Bœuf would bear themout with their master, who had commanded them to tend the dying man.”“The dying man, knaves!” rejoined the Baron; “I promise thee we shall all be dying men an we stand not to it the more stoutly. But Iwill relieve the guard upon this caitiff companion of yours.—Here, Urfried—hag—ﬁend of a Saxon witch—hearest me not?—tend methis bedridden fellow since he must needs be tended, whilst these knaves use their weapons.—Here be two arblasts, comrades, withwindlaces and quarrells 34—to the barbican with you, and see you drive each bolt through a Saxon brain.”The men, who, like most of their description, were fond of enterprise and detested inaction, went joyfully to the scene of danger asthey were commanded, and thus the charge of Ivanhoe was transferred to Urfried, or Ulrica. But she, whose brain was burning withremembrance of injuries and with hopes of vengeance, was readily induced to devolve upon Rebecca the care of her patient.CHAPTER XXIXAscend the watch-tower yonder, valiant soldier,Look on the ﬁeld, and say how goes the battle.SCHILLER’S MAID OF ORLEANSA moment of peril is often also a moment of open-hearted kindness and affection. We are thrown off our guard by the generalagitation of our feelings, and betray the intensity of those, which, at more tranquil periods, our prudence at least conceals, if it cannotaltogether suppress them. In ﬁnding herself once more by the side of Ivanhoe, Rebecca was astonished at the keen sensation ofpleasure which she experienced, even at a time when all around them both was danger, if not despair. As she felt his pulse, andenquired after his health, there was a softness in her touch and in her accents implying a kinder interest than she would herself havebeen pleased to have voluntarily expressed. Her voice faltered and her hand trembled, and it was only the cold question of Ivanhoe, “Isit you, gentle maiden?” which recalled her to herself, and reminded her the sensations which she felt were not and could not bemutual. A sigh escaped, but it was scarce audible; and the questions which she asked the knight concerning his state of health were putin the tone of calm friendship. Ivanhoe answered her hastily that he was, in point of health, as well, and better than he could haveexpected—“Thanks,” he said, “dear Rebecca, to thy helpful skill.”“He calls me DEAR Rebecca,” said the maiden to herself, “but it is in the cold and careless tone which ill suits the word. His war-horse—his hunting hound, are dearer to him than the despised Jewess!”“My mind, gentle maiden,” continued Ivanhoe, “is more disturbed by anxiety, than my body with pain. From the speeches of thosemen who were my warders just now, I learn that I am a prisoner, and, if I judge aright of the loud hoarse voice which even nowdispatched them hence on some military duty, I am in the castle of Front-de-Bœuf—If so, how will this end, or how can I protectRowena and my father?”“He names not the Jew or Jewess,” said Rebecca internally; “yet what is our portion in him, and how justly am I punished byHeaven for letting my thoughts dwell upon him!” She hastened after this brief self-accusation to give Ivanhoe what information shecould; but it amounted only to this, that the Templar Bois-Guilbert, and the Baron Front-de-Bœuf, were commanders within the castle;that it was beleaguered from without, but by whom she knew not. She added, that there was a Christian priest within the castle whomight be possessed of more information.“A Christian priest!” said the knight, joyfully; “fetch him hither, Rebecca, if thou canst—say a sick man desires his ghostly counsel—say what thou wilt, but bring him—something I must do or attempt, but how can I determine until I know how matters standwithout?”Rebecca in compliance with the wishes of Ivanhoe, made that attempt to bring Cedric into the wounded Knight’s chamber, whichwas defeated as we have already seen by the interference of Urfried, who had also been on the watch to intercept the supposed monk.Rebecca retired to communicate to Ivanhoe the result of her errand.They had not much leisure to regret the failure of this source of intelligence, or to contrive by what means it might be supplied; forthe noise within the castle, occasioned by the defensive preparations which had been considerable for some time, now increased intotenfold bustle and clamour. The heavy, yet hasty step of the men-at-arms, traversed the battlements or resounded on the narrow andwinding passages and stairs which led to the various bartisans and points of defence. The voices of the knights were heard, animatingtheir followers, or directing means of defence, while their commands were often drowned in the clashing of armour, or the clamorousshouts of those whom they addressed. Tremendous as these sounds were, and yet more terrible from the awful event which theypresaged, there was a sublimity mixed with them, which Rebecca’s high-toned mind could feel even in that moment of terror. Her eyekindled, although the blood ﬂed from her cheeks; and there was a strong mixture of fear, and of a thrilling sense of the sublime, as sherepeated, half whispering to herself, half speaking to her companion, the sacred text,—“The quiver rattleth—the glittering spear andthe shield—the noise of the captains and the shouting!”But Ivanhoe was like the war-horse of that sublime passage, glowing with impatience at his inactivity, and with his ardent desire tomingle in the affray of which these sounds were the introduction. “If I could but drag myself,” he said, “to yonder window, that Imight see how this brave game is like to go—If I had but bow to shoot a shaft, or battle-axe to strike were it but a single blow for ourdeliverance!—It is in vain—it is in vain—I am alike nerveless and weaponless!”“Fret not thyself, noble knight,” answered Rebecca, “the sounds have ceased of a sudden—it may be they join not battle.”“Thou knowest nought of it,” said Wilfred, impatiently; “this dead pause only shows that the men are at their posts on the walls, andexpecting an instant attack; what we have heard was but the instant muttering of the storm—it will burst anon in all its fury.—Could Ibut reach yonder window!”“Thou wilt but injure thyself by the attempt, noble knight,” replied his attendant. Observing his extreme solicitude, she ﬁrmlyadded, “I myself will stand at the lattice, and describe to you as I can what passes without.”“You must not—you shall not!” exclaimed Ivanhoe; “each lattice, each aperture, will be soon a mark for the archers; some randomshaft—”“It shall be welcome!” murmured Rebecca, as with ﬁrm pace she ascended two or three steps, which led to the window of whichthey spoke.“Rebecca, dear Rebecca!” exclaimed Ivanhoe, “this is no maiden’s pastime—do not expose thyself to wounds and death, and renderme for ever miserable for having given the occasion; at least, cover thyself with yonder ancient buckler, and show as little of yourperson at the lattice as may be.”Following with wonderful promptitude the directions of Ivanhoe, and availing herself of the protection of the large ancient shield,which she placed against the lower part of the window, Rebecca, with tolerable security to herself, could witness part of what waspassing without the castle, and report to Ivanhoe the preparations which the assailants were making for the storm. Indeed the situationwhich she thus obtained was peculiarly favourable for this purpose, because, being placed on an angle of the main building, Rebeccacould not only see what passed beyond the precincts of the castle, but also commanded a view of the outwork likely to be the ﬁrstobject of the meditated assault. It was an exterior fortiﬁcation of no great height or strength, intended to protect the postern-gate,through which Cedric had been recently dismissed by Front-de-Bœuf. The castle moat divided this species of barbican from the rest ofthe fortress, so that, in case of its being taken, it was easy to cut off the communication with the main building, by withdrawing thetemporary bridge. In the outwork was a sallyport corresponding to the postern of the castle, and the whole was surrounded by a strongpalisade. Rebecca could observe, from the number of men placed for the defence of this post, that the besieged entertainedapprehensions for its safety; and from the mustering of the assailants in a direction nearly opposite to the outwork, it seemed no lessplain that it had been selected as a vulnerable point of attack.These appearances she hastily communicated to Ivanhoe, and added, “The skirts of the wood seem lined with archers, although onlya few are advanced from its dark shadow.”“Under what banner?” asked Ivanhoe.“Under no ensign of war which I can observe,” answered Rebecca.“A singular novelty,” muttered the knight, “to advance to storm such a castle without pennon or banner displayed!—Seest thou whothey be that act as leaders?”“A knight, clad in sable armour, is the most conspicuous,” said the Jewess; “he alone is armed from head to heel, and seems toassume the direction of all around him.”“What device does he bear on his shield?” replied Ivanhoe.“Something resembling a bar of iron, and a padlock painted blue on the black shield.” 35“A fetterlock and shacklebolt azure,” said Ivanhoe; “I know not who may bear the device, but well I ween it might now be mineown. Canst thou not see the motto?”“Scarce the device itself at this distance,” replied Rebecca; “but when the sun glances fair upon his shield, it shows as I tell you.”“Seem there no other leaders?” exclaimed the anxious enquirer.“None of mark and distinction that I can behold from this station,” said Rebecca; “but, doubtless, the other side of the castle is alsoassailed. They appear even now preparing to advance—God of Zion, protect us!—What a dreadful sight!—Those who advance ﬁrstbear huge shields and defences made of plank; the others follow, bending their bows as they come on.—They raise their bows!—Godof Moses, forgive the creatures thou hast made!”Her description was here suddenly interrupted by the signal for assault, which was given by the blast of a shrill bugle, and at onceanswered by a ﬂourish of the Norman trumpets from the battlements, which, mingled with the deep and hollow clang of the nakers, (aspecies of kettle-drum,) retorted in notes of deﬁance the challenge of the enemy. The shouts of both parties augmented the fearful din,the assailants crying, “Saint George for merry England!” and the Normans answering them with loud cries of “En avant De Bracy!—Beau-seant! Beau-seant!—Front-de-Bœuf a la rescousse!” according to the war-cries of their different commanders.It was not, however, by clamour that the contest was to be decided, and the desperate efforts of the assailants were met by anequally vigorous defence on the part of the besieged. The archers, trained by their woodland pastimes to the most effective use of thelong-bow, shot, to use the appropriate phrase of the time, so “wholly together,” that no point at which a defender could show the leastpart of his person, escaped their cloth-yard shafts. By this heavy discharge, which continued as thick and sharp as hail, while,notwithstanding, every arrow had its individual aim, and ﬂew by scores together against each embrasure and opening in the parapets,as well as at every window where a defender either occasionally had post, or might be suspected to be stationed,—by this sustaineddischarge, two or three of the garrison were slain, and several others wounded. But, conﬁdent in their armour of proof, and in thecover which their situation afforded, the followers of Front-de-Bœuf, and his allies, showed an obstinacy in defence proportioned tothe fury of the attack and replied with the discharge of their large cross-bows, as well as with their long-bows, slings, and other missileweapons, to the close and continued shower of arrows; and, as the assailants were necessarily but indifferently protected, didconsiderably more damage than they received at their hand. The whizzing of shafts and of missiles, on both sides, was only interruptedby the shouts which arose when either side inﬂicted or sustained some notable loss.“And I must lie here like a bedridden monk,” exclaimed Ivanhoe, “while the game that gives me freedom or death is played out bythe hand of others!—Look from the window once again, kind maiden, but beware that you are not marked by the archers beneath—Look out once more, and tell me if they yet advance to the storm.”With patient courage, strengthened by the interval which she had employed in mental devotion, Rebecca again took post at thelattice, sheltering herself, however, so as not to be visible from beneath.“What dost thou see, Rebecca?” again demanded the wounded knight.“Nothing but the cloud of arrows ﬂying so thick as to dazzle mine eyes, and to hide the bowmen who shoot them.”“That cannot endure,” said Ivanhoe; “if they press not right on to carry the castle by pure force of arms, the archery may avail butlittle against stone walls and bulwarks. Look for the Knight of the Fetterlock, fair Rebecca, and see how he bears himself; for as theleader is, so will his followers be.”“I see him not,” said Rebecca.“Foul craven!” exclaimed Ivanhoe; “does he blench from the helm when the wind blows highest?”“He blenches not! he blenches not!” said Rebecca, “I see him now; he leads a body of men close under the outer barrier of thebarbican. 36 —They pull down the piles and palisades; they hew down the barriers with axes.—His high black plume ﬂoats abroadover the throng, like a raven over the ﬁeld of the slain.—They have made a breach in the barriers—they rush in—they are thrust back!—Front-de-Bœuf heads the defenders; I see his gigantic form above the press. They throng again to the breach, and the pass isdisputed hand to hand, and man to man. God of Jacob! it is the meeting of two ﬁerce tides—the conﬂict of two oceans moved byadverse winds!”She turned her head from the lattice, as if unable longer to endure a sight so terrible.“Look forth again, Rebecca,” said Ivanhoe, mistaking the cause of her retiring; “the archery must in some degree have ceased, sincethey are now ﬁghting hand to hand.—Look again, there is now less danger.”Rebecca again looked forth, and almost immediately exclaimed, “Holy prophets of the law! Front-de-Bœuf and the Black Knightﬁght hand to hand on the breach, amid the roar of their followers, who watch the progress of the strife—Heaven strike with the causeof the oppressed and of the captive!” She then uttered a loud shriek, and exclaimed, “He is down!—he is down!”“Who is down?” cried Ivanhoe; “for our dear Lady’s sake, tell me which has fallen?”“The Black Knight,” answered Rebecca, faintly; then instantly again shouted with joyful eagerness—“But no—but no!—the nameof the Lord of Hosts be blessed!—he is on foot again, and ﬁghts as if there were twenty men’s strength in his single arm—His sword isbroken—he snatches an axe from a yeoman—he presses Front-de-Bœuf with blow on blow—The giant stoops and totters like an oakunder the steel of the woodman—he falls—he falls!”“Front-de-Bœuf?” exclaimed Ivanhoe.“Front-de-Bœuf!” answered the Jewess; “his men rush to the rescue, headed by the haughty Templar—their united force compelsthe champion to pause—They drag Front-de-Bœuf within the walls.”“The assailants have won the barriers, have they not?” said Ivanhoe.“They have—they have!” exclaimed Rebecca—“and they press the besieged hard upon the outer wall; some plant ladders, someswarm like bees, and endeavour to ascend upon the shoulders of each other—down go stones, beams, and trunks of trees upon theirheads, and as fast as they bear the wounded to the rear, fresh men supply their places in the assault—Great God! hast thou given menthine own image, that it should be thus cruelly defaced by the hands of their brethren!”“Think not of that,” said Ivanhoe; “this is no time for such thoughts—Who yield?—who push their way?”“The ladders are thrown down,” replied Rebecca, shuddering; “the soldiers lie grovelling under them like crushed reptiles—Thebesieged have the better.”“Saint George strike for us!” exclaimed the knight; “do the false yeomen give way?”“No!” exclaimed Rebecca, “they bear themselves right yeomanly—the Black Knight approaches the postern with his huge axe—thethundering blows which he deals, you may hear them above all the din and shouts of the battle—Stones and beams are hailed down onthe bold champion—he regards them no more than if they were thistle-down or feathers!”“By Saint John of Acre,” said Ivanhoe, raising himself joyfully on his couch, “methought there was but one man in England thatmight do such a deed!”“The postern gate shakes,” continued Rebecca; “it crashes—it is splintered by his blows—they rush in—the outwork is won—Oh,God!—they hurl the defenders from the battlements—they throw them into the moat—O men, if ye be indeed men, spare them thatcan resist no longer!”“The bridge—the bridge which communicates with the castle—have they won that pass?” exclaimed Ivanhoe.“No,” replied Rebecca, “The Templar has destroyed the plank on which they crossed—few of the defenders escaped with him intothe castle—the shrieks and cries which you hear tell the fate of the others—Alas!—I see it is still more difﬁcult to look upon victorythan upon battle.”“What do they now, maiden?” said Ivanhoe; “look forth yet again—this is no time to faint at bloodshed.”“It is over for the time,” answered Rebecca; “our friends strengthen themselves within the outwork which they have mastered, and itaffords them so good a shelter from the foemen’s shot, that the garrison only bestow a few bolts on it from interval to interval, as ifrather to disquiet than effectually to injure them.”“Our friends,” said Wilfred, “will surely not abandon an enterprise so gloriously begun and so happily attained.—O no! I will putmy faith in the good knight whose axe hath rent heart-of-oak and bars of iron.—Singular,” he again muttered to himself, “if there betwo who can do a deed of such derring-do! 37—a fetterlock, and a shacklebolt on a ﬁeld sable—what may that mean?—seest thounought else, Rebecca, by which the Black Knight may be distinguished?”“Nothing,” said the Jewess; “all about him is black as the wing of the night raven. Nothing can I spy that can mark him further—buthaving once seen him put forth his strength in battle, methinks I could know him again among a thousand warriors. He rushes to thefray as if he were summoned to a banquet. There is more than mere strength, there seems as if the whole soul and spirit of thechampion were given to every blow which he deals upon his enemies. God assoilize him of the sin of bloodshed!—it is fearful, yetmagniﬁcent, to behold how the arm and heart of one man can triumph over hundreds.”“Rebecca,” said Ivanhoe, “thou hast painted a hero; surely they rest but to refresh their force, or to provide the means of crossingthe moat—Under such a leader as thou hast spoken this knight to be, there are no craven fears, no cold-blooded delays, no yielding upa gallant emprize; since the difﬁculties which render it arduous render it also glorious. I swear by the honour of my house—I vow bythe name of my bright lady-love, I would endure ten years’ captivity to ﬁght one day by that good knight’s side in such a quarrel asthis!”“Alas,” said Rebecca, leaving her station at the window, and approaching the couch of the wounded knight, “this impatient yearningafter action—this struggling with and repining at your present weakness, will not fail to injure your returning health—How couldstthou hope to inﬂict wounds on others, ere that be healed which thou thyself hast received?”“Rebecca,” he replied, “thou knowest not how impossible it is for one trained to actions of chivalry to remain passive as a priest, ora woman, when they are acting deeds of honour around him. The love of battle is the food upon which we live—the dust of the‘melee’ is the breath of our nostrils! We live not—we wish not to live—longer than while we are victorious and renowned—Such,maiden, are the laws of chivalry to which we are sworn, and to which we offer all that we hold dear.”“Alas!” said the fair Jewess, “and what is it, valiant knight, save an offering of sacriﬁce to a demon of vain glory, and a passingthrough the ﬁre to Moloch?—What remains to you as the prize of all the blood you have spilled—of all the travail and pain you haveendured—of all the tears which your deeds have caused, when death hath broken the strong man’s spear, and overtaken the speed ofhis war-horse?”“What remains?” cried Ivanhoe; “Glory, maiden, glory! which gilds our sepulchre and embalms our name.”“Glory?” continued Rebecca; “alas, is the rusted mail which hangs as a hatchment over the champion’s dim and mouldering tomb—is the defaced sculpture of the inscription which the ignorant monk can hardly read to the enquiring pilgrim—are these sufﬁcientrewards for the sacriﬁce of every kindly affection, for a life spent miserably that ye may make others miserable? Or is there suchvirtue in the rude rhymes of a wandering bard, that domestic love, kindly affection, peace and happiness, are so wildly bartered, tobecome the hero of those ballads which vagabond minstrels sing to drunken churls over their evening ale?”“By the soul of Hereward!” replied the knight impatiently, “thou speakest, maiden, of thou knowest not what. Thou wouldst quenchthe pure light of chivalry, which alone distinguishes the noble from the base, the gentle knight from the churl and the savage; whichrates our life far, far beneath the pitch of our honour; raises us victorious over pain, toil, and suffering, and teaches us to fear no evilbut disgrace. Thou art no Christian, Rebecca; and to thee are unknown those high feelings which swell the bosom of a noble maidenwhen her lover hath done some deed of emprize which sanctions his ﬂame. Chivalry!—why, maiden, she is the nurse of pure and highaffection—the stay of the oppressed, the redresser of grievances, the curb of the power of the tyrant—Nobility were but an emptyname without her, and liberty ﬁnds the best protection in her lance and her sword.”“I am, indeed,” said Rebecca, “sprung from a race whose courage was distinguished in the defence of their own land, but whowarred not, even while yet a nation, save at the command of the Deity, or in defending their country from oppression. The sound of thetrumpet wakes Judah no longer, and her despised children are now but the unresisting victims of hostile and military oppression. Wellhast thou spoken, Sir Knight,—until the God of Jacob shall raise up for his chosen people a second Gideon, or a new Maccabeus, it illbeseemeth the Jewish damsel to speak of battle or of war.”The high-minded maiden concluded the argument in a tone of sorrow, which deeply expressed her sense of the degradation of herpeople, embittered perhaps by the idea that Ivanhoe considered her as one not entitled to interfere in a case of honour, and incapable ofentertaining or expressing sentiments of honour and generosity.“How little he knows this bosom,” she said, “to imagine that cowardice or meanness of soul must needs be its guests, because Ihave censured the fantastic chivalry of the Nazarenes! Would to heaven that the shedding of mine own blood, drop by drop, couldredeem the captivity of Judah! Nay, would to God it could avail to set free my father, and this his benefactor, from the chains of theoppressor! The proud Christian should then see whether the daughter of God’s chosen people dared not to die as bravely as the vainestNazarene maiden, that boasts her descent from some petty chieftain of the rude and frozen north!”She then looked towards the couch of the wounded knight.“He sleeps,” she said; “nature exhausted by sufferance and the waste of spirits, his wearied frame embraces the ﬁrst moment oftemporary relaxation to sink into slumber. Alas! is it a crime that I should look upon him, when it may be for the last time?—When yetbut a short space, and those fair features will be no longer animated by the bold and buoyant spirit which forsakes them not even insleep!—When the nostril shall be distended, the mouth agape, the eyes ﬁxed and bloodshot; and when the proud and noble knight maybe trodden on by the lowest caitiff of this accursed castle, yet stir not when the heel is lifted up against him!—And my father!—oh,my father! evil is it with his daughter, when his grey hairs are not remembered because of the golden locks of youth!—What know Ibut that these evils are the messengers of Jehovah’s wrath to the unnatural child, who thinks of a stranger’s captivity before a parent’s?who forgets the desolation of Judah, and looks upon the comeliness of a Gentile and a stranger?—But I will tear this folly from myheart, though every ﬁbre bleed as I rend it away!”She wrapped herself closely in her veil, and sat down at a distance from the couch of the wounded knight, with her back turnedtowards it, fortifying, or endeavouring to fortify her mind, not only against the impending evils from without, but also against thosetreacherous feelings which assailed her from within.CHAPTER XXXApproach the chamber, look upon his bed.His is the passing of no peaceful ghost,Which, as the lark arises to the sky,’Mid morning’s sweetest breeze and softest dew,Is wing’d to heaven by good men’s sighs and tears!—Anselm parts otherwise.OLD PLAYDuring the interval of quiet which followed the ﬁrst success of the besiegers, while the one party was preparing to pursue theiradvantage, and the other to strengthen their means of defence, the Templar and De Bracy held brief council together in the hall of thecastle.“Where is Front-de-Bœuf?” said the latter, who had superintended the defence of the fortress on the other side; “men say he hathbeen slain.”“He lives,” said the Templar, coolly, “lives as yet; but had he worn the bull’s head of which he bears the name, and ten plates of ironto fence it withal, he must have gone down before yonder fatal axe. Yet a few hours, and Front-de-Bœuf is with his fathers—apowerful limb lopped off Prince John’s enterprise.”“And a brave addition to the kingdom of Satan,” said De Bracy; “this comes of reviling saints and angels, and ordering images ofholy things and holy men to be ﬂung down on the heads of these rascaille yeomen.”“Go to—thou art a fool,” said the Templar; “thy superstition is upon a level with Front-de-Bœuf’s want of faith; neither of you canrender a reason for your belief or unbelief.”“Benedicite, Sir Templar,” replied De Bracy, “pray you to keep better rule with your tongue when I am the theme of it. By theMother of Heaven, I am a better Christian man than thou and thy fellowship; for the ‘bruit’ goeth shrewdly out, that the most holyOrder of the Temple of Zion nurseth not a few heretics within its bosom, and that Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert is of the number.”“Care not thou for such reports,” said the Templar; “but let us think of making good the castle.—How fought these villain yeomenon thy side?”“Like ﬁends incarnate,” said De Bracy. “They swarmed close up to the walls, headed, as I think, by the knave who won the prize atthe archery, for I knew his horn and baldric. And this is old Fitzurse’s boasted policy, encouraging these malapert knaves to rebelagainst us! Had I not been armed in proof, the villain had marked me down seven times with as little remorse as if I had been a buck inseason. He told every rivet on my armour with a cloth-yard shaft, that rapped against my ribs with as little compunction as if my boneshad been of iron—But that I wore a shirt of Spanish mail under my plate-coat, I had been fairly sped.”“But you maintained your post?” said the Templar. “We lost the outwork on our part.”“That is a shrewd loss,” said De Bracy; “the knaves will ﬁnd cover there to assault the castle more closely, and may, if not wellwatched, gain some unguarded corner of a tower, or some forgotten window, and so break in upon us. Our numbers are too few for thedefence of every point, and the men complain that they can nowhere show themselves, but they are the mark for as many arrows as aparish-butt on a holyday even. Front-de-Bœuf is dying too, so we shall receive no more aid from his bull’s head and brutal strength.How think you, Sir Brian, were we not better make a virtue of necessity, and compound with the rogues by delivering up ourprisoners?”“How?” exclaimed the Templar; “deliver up our prisoners, and stand an object alike of ridicule and execration, as the doughtywarriors who dared by a night-attack to possess themselves of the persons of a party of defenceless travellers, yet could not make gooda strong castle against a vagabond troop of outlaws, led by swineherds, jesters, and the very refuse of mankind?—Shame on thycounsel, Maurice de Bracy!—The ruins of this castle shall bury both my body and my shame, ere I consent to such base anddishonourable composition.”“Let us to the walls, then,” said De Bracy, carelessly; “that man never breathed, be he Turk or Templar, who held life at lighter ratethan I do. But I trust there is no dishonour in wishing I had here some two scores of my gallant troop of Free Companions?—Oh, mybrave lances! if ye knew but how hard your captain were this day bested, how soon should I see my banner at the head of your clumpof spears! And how short while would these rabble villains stand to endure your encounter!”“Wish for whom thou wilt,” said the Templar, “but let us make what defence we can with the soldiers who remain—They arechieﬂy Front-de-Bœuf’s followers, hated by the English for a thousand acts of insolence and oppression.”“The better,” said De Bracy; “the rugged slaves will defend themselves to the last drop of their blood, ere they encounter therevenge of the peasants without. Let us up and be doing, then, Brian de Bois-Guilbert; and, live or die, thou shalt see Maurice deBracy bear himself this day as a gentleman of blood and lineage.”“To the walls!” answered the Templar; and they both ascended the battlements to do all that skill could dictate, and manhoodaccomplish, in defence of the place. They readily agreed that the point of greatest danger was that opposite to the outwork of whichthe assailants had possessed themselves. The castle, indeed, was divided from that barbican by the moat, and it was impossible that thebesiegers could assail the postern-door, with which the outwork corresponded, without surmounting that obstacle; but it was theopinion both of the Templar and De Bracy, that the besiegers, if governed by the same policy their leader had already displayed, wouldendeavour, by a formidable assault, to draw the chief part of the defenders’ observation to this point, and take measures to availthemselves of every negligence which might take place in the defence elsewhere. To guard against such an evil, their numbers onlypermitted the knights to place sentinels from space to space along the walls in communication with each other, who might give thealarm whenever danger was threatened. Meanwhile, they agreed that De Bracy should command the defence at the postern, and theTemplar should keep with him a score of men or thereabouts as a body of reserve, ready to hasten to any other point which might besuddenly threatened. The loss of the barbican had also this unfortunate effect, that, notwithstanding the superior height of the castlewalls, the besieged could not see from them, with the same precision as before, the operations of the enemy; for some stragglingunderwood approached so near the sallyport of the outwork, that the assailants might introduce into it whatever force they thoughtproper, not only under cover, but even without the knowledge of the defenders. Utterly uncertain, therefore, upon what point the stormwas to burst, De Bracy and his companion were under the necessity of providing against every possible contingency, and theirfollowers, however brave, experienced the anxious dejection of mind incident to men enclosed by enemies, who possessed the powerof choosing their time and mode of attack.Meanwhile, the lord of the beleaguered and endangered castle lay upon a bed of bodily pain and mental agony. He had not the usualresource of bigots in that superstitious period, most of whom were wont to atone for the crimes they were guilty of by liberality to thechurch, stupefying by this means their terrors by the idea of atonement and forgiveness; and although the refuge which success thuspurchased, was no more like to the peace of mind which follows on sincere repentance, than the turbid stupefaction procured byopium resembles healthy and natural slumbers, it was still a state of mind preferable to the agonies of awakened remorse. But amongthe vices of Front-de-Bœuf, a hard and griping man, avarice was predominant; and he preferred setting church and churchmen atdeﬁance, to purchasing from them pardon and absolution at the price of treasure and of manors. Nor did the Templar, an inﬁdel ofanother stamp, justly characterise his associate, when he said Front-de-Bœuf could assign no cause for his unbelief and contempt forthe established faith; for the Baron would have alleged that the Church sold her wares too dear, that the spiritual freedom which sheput up to sale was only to be bought like that of the chief captain of Jerusalem, “with a great sum,” and Front-de-Bœuf preferreddenying the virtue of the medicine, to paying the expense of the physician.But the moment had now arrived when earth and all his treasures were gliding from before his eyes, and when the savage Baron’sheart, though hard as a nether millstone, became appalled as he gazed forward into the waste darkness of futurity. The fever of hisbody aided the impatience and agony of his mind, and his death-bed exhibited a mixture of the newly awakened feelings of horror,combating with the ﬁxed and inveterate obstinacy of his disposition;—a fearful state of mind, only to be equalled in those tremendousregions, where there are complaints without hope, remorse without repentance, a dreadful sense of present agony, and a presentimentthat it cannot cease or be diminished!“Where be these dog-priests now,” growled the Baron, “who set such price on their ghostly mummery?—where be all those unshodCarmelites, for whom old Front-de-Bœuf founded the convent of St Anne, robbing his heir of many a fair rood of meadow, and manya fat ﬁeld and close—where be the greedy hounds now?—Swilling, I warrant me, at the ale, or playing their juggling tricks at thebedside of some miserly churl.—Me, the heir of their founder—me, whom their foundation binds them to pray for—me—ungratefulvillains as they are!—they suffer to die like the houseless dog on yonder common, unshriven and unhouseled!—Tell the Templar tocome hither—he is a priest, and may do something—But no!—as well confess myself to the devil as to Brian de Bois-Guilbert, whorecks neither of heaven nor of hell.—I have heard old men talk of prayer—prayer by their own voice—Such need not to court or tobribe the false priest—But I—I dare not!”“Lives Reginald Front-de-Bœuf,” said a broken and shrill voice close by his bedside, “to say there is that which he dares not!”The evil conscience and the shaken nerves of Front-de-Bœuf heard, in this strange interruption to his soliloquy, the voice of one ofthose demons, who, as the superstition of the times believed, beset the beds of dying men to distract their thoughts, and turn them fromthe meditations which concerned their eternal welfare. He shuddered and drew himself together; but, instantly summoning up hiswonted resolution, he exclaimed, “Who is there?—what art thou, that darest to echo my words in a tone like that of the night-raven?—Come before my couch that I may see thee.”“I am thine evil angel, Reginald Front-de-Bœuf,” replied the voice.“Let me behold thee then in thy bodily shape, if thou be’st indeed a ﬁend,” replied the dying knight; “think not that I will blenchfrom thee.—By the eternal dungeon, could I but grapple with these horrors that hover round me, as I have done with mortal dangers,heaven or hell should never say that I shrunk from the conﬂict!”“Think on thy sins, Reginald Front-de-Bœuf,” said the almost unearthly voice, “on rebellion, on rapine, on murder!—Who stirredup the licentious John to war against his grey-headed father—against his generous brother?”“Be thou ﬁend, priest, or devil,” replied Front-de-Bœuf, “thou liest in thy throat!—Not I stirred John to rebellion—not I alone—there were ﬁfty knights and barons, the ﬂower of the midland counties—better men never laid lance in rest—And must I answer forthe fault done by ﬁfty?—False ﬁend, I defy thee! Depart, and haunt my couch no more—let me die in peace if thou be mortal—if thoube a demon, thy time is not yet come.”“In peace thou shalt NOT die,” repeated the voice; “even in death shalt thou think on thy murders—on the groans which this castlehas echoed—on the blood that is engrained in its ﬂoors!”“Thou canst not shake me by thy petty malice,” answered Front-de-Bœuf, with a ghastly and constrained laugh. “The inﬁdel Jew—it was merit with heaven to deal with him as I did, else wherefore are men canonized who dip their hands in the blood of Saracens?—The Saxon porkers, whom I have slain, they were the foes of my country, and of my lineage, and of my liege lord.—Ho! ho! thou seestthere is no crevice in my coat of plate—Art thou ﬂed?—art thou silenced?”“No, foul parricide!” replied the voice; “think of thy father!—think of his death!—think of his banquet-room ﬂooded with his gore,and that poured forth by the hand of a son!”“Ha!” answered the Baron, after a long pause, “an thou knowest that, thou art indeed the author of evil, and as omniscient as themonks call thee!—That secret I deemed locked in my own breast, and in that of one besides—the temptress, the partaker of my guilt.—Go, leave me, ﬁend! and seek the Saxon witch Ulrica, who alone could tell thee what she and I alone witnessed.—Go, I say, to her,who washed the wounds, and straighted the corpse, and gave to the slain man the outward show of one parted in time and in the courseof nature—Go to her, she was my temptress, the foul provoker, the more foul rewarder, of the deed—let her, as well as I, taste of thetortures which anticipate hell!”“She already tastes them,” said Ulrica, stepping before the couch of Front-de-Bœuf; “she hath long drunken of this cup, and itsbitterness is now sweetened to see that thou dost partake it.—Grind not thy teeth, Front-de-Bœuf—roll not thine eyes—clench notthine hand, nor shake it at me with that gesture of menace!—The hand which, like that of thy renowned ancestor who gained thyname, could have broken with one stroke the skull of a mountain-bull, is now unnerved and powerless as mine own!”“Vile murderous hag!” replied Front-de-Bœuf; “detestable screech-owl! it is then thou who art come to exult over the ruins thouhast assisted to lay low?”“Ay, Reginald Front-de-Bœuf,” answered she, “it is Ulrica!—it is the daughter of the murdered Torquil Wolfganger!—it is the sisterof his slaughtered sons!—it is she who demands of thee, and of thy father’s house, father and kindred, name and fame—all that shehas lost by the name of Front-de-Bœuf!—Think of my wrongs, Front-de-Bœuf, and answer me if I speak not truth. Thou hast been myevil angel, and I will be thine—I will dog thee till the very instant of dissolution!”“Detestable fury!” exclaimed Front-de-Bœuf, “that moment shalt thou never witness—Ho! Giles, Clement, and Eustace! SaintMaur, and Stephen! seize this damned witch, and hurl her from the battlements headlong—she has betrayed us to the Saxon!—Ho!Saint Maur! Clement! false-hearted, knaves, where tarry ye?”“Call on them again, valiant Baron,” said the hag, with a smile of grisly mockery; “summon thy vassals around thee, doom themthat loiter to the scourge and the dungeon—But know, mighty chief,” she continued, suddenly changing her tone, “thou shalt haveneither answer, nor aid, nor obedience at their hands.—Listen to these horrid sounds,” for the din of the recommenced assault anddefence now rung fearfully loud from the battlements of the castle; “in that war-cry is the downfall of thy house—The blood-cementedfabric of Front-de-Bœuf’s power totters to the foundation, and before the foes he most despised!—The Saxon, Reginald!—the scornedSaxon assails thy walls!—Why liest thou here, like a worn-out hind, when the Saxon storms thy place of strength?”“Gods and ﬁends!” exclaimed the wounded knight; “O, for one moment’s strength, to drag myself to the ‘melee’, and perish asbecomes my name!”“Think not of it, valiant warrior!” replied she; “thou shalt die no soldier’s death, but perish like the fox in his den, when the peasantshave set ﬁre to the cover around it.”“Hateful hag! thou liest!” exclaimed Front-de-Bœuf; “my followers bear them bravely—my walls are strong and high—mycomrades in arms fear not a whole host of Saxons, were they headed by Hengist and Horsa!—The war-cry of the Templar and of theFree Companions rises high over the conﬂict! And by mine honour, when we kindle the blazing beacon, for joy of our defence, it shallconsume thee, body and bones; and I shall live to hear thou art gone from earthly ﬁres to those of that hell, which never sent forth anincarnate ﬁend more utterly diabolical!”“Hold thy belief,” replied Ulrica, “till the proof reach thee—But, no!” she said, interrupting herself, “thou shalt know, even now, thedoom, which all thy power, strength, and courage, is unable to avoid, though it is prepared for thee by this feeble band. Markest thouthe smouldering and suffocating vapour which already eddies in sable folds through the chamber?—Didst thou think it was but thedarkening of thy bursting eyes—the difﬁculty of thy cumbered breathing?—No! Front-de-Bœuf, there is another cause—Rememberest thou the magazine of fuel that is stored beneath these apartments?”“Woman!” he exclaimed with fury, “thou hast not set ﬁre to it?—By heaven, thou hast, and the castle is in ﬂames!”“They are fast rising at least,” said Ulrica, with frightful composure; “and a signal shall soon wave to warn the besiegers to presshard upon those who would extinguish them.—Farewell, Front-de-Bœuf!—May Mista, Skogula, and Zernebock, gods of the ancientSaxons—ﬁends, as the priests now call them—supply the place of comforters at your dying bed, which Ulrica now relinquishes!—Butknow, if it will give thee comfort to know it, that Ulrica is bound to the same dark coast with thyself, the companion of thy punishmentas the companion of thy guilt.—And now, parricide, farewell for ever!—May each stone of this vaulted roof ﬁnd a tongue to echo thattitle into thine ear!”So saying, she left the apartment; and Front-de-Bœuf could hear the crash of the ponderous key, as she locked and double-lockedthe door behind her, thus cutting off the most slender chance of escape. In the extremity of agony he shouted upon his servants andallies—“Stephen and Saint Maur!—Clement and Giles!—I burn here unaided!—To the rescue—to the rescue, brave Bois-Guilbert,valiant De Bracy!—It is Front-de-Bœuf who calls!—It is your master, ye traitor squires!—Your ally—your brother in arms, yeperjured and faithless knights!—all the curses due to traitors upon your recreant heads, do you abandon me to perish thus miserably!—They hear me not—they cannot hear me—my voice is lost in the din of battle.—The smoke rolls thicker and thicker—the ﬁre hascaught upon the ﬂoor below—O, for one drought of the air of heaven, were it to be purchased by instant annihilation!” And in the madfrenzy of despair, the wretch now shouted with the shouts of the ﬁghters, now muttered curses on himself, on mankind, and on Heavenitself.—“The red ﬁre ﬂashes through the thick smoke!” he exclaimed; “the demon marches against me under the banner of his ownelement—Foul spirit, avoid!—I go not with thee without my comrades—all, all are thine, that garrison these walls—Thinkest thouFront-de-Bœuf will be singled out to go alone?—No—the inﬁdel Templar—the licentious De Bracy—Ulrica, the foul murderingstrumpet—the men who aided my enterprises—the dog Saxons and accursed Jews, who are my prisoners—all, all shall attend me—agoodly fellowship as ever took the downward road—Ha, ha, ha!” and he laughed in his frenzy till the vaulted roof rang again. “Wholaughed there?” exclaimed Front-de-Bœuf, in altered mood, for the noise of the conﬂict did not prevent the echoes of his own madlaughter from returning upon his ear—“who laughed there?—Ulrica, was it thou?—Speak, witch, and I forgive thee—for, only thou orthe ﬁend of hell himself could have laughed at such a moment. Avaunt—avaunt!—-”But it were impious to trace any farther the picture of the blasphemer and parricide’s deathbed.CHAPTER XXXIOnce more unto the breach, dear friends, once more,Or, close the wall up with our English dead.———And you, good yeomen,Whose limbs were made in England, show us hereThe mettle of your pasture—let us swearThat you are worth your breeding.KING HENRY VCedric, although not greatly conﬁdent in Ulrica’s message, omitted not to communicate her promise to the Black Knight andLocksley. They were well pleased to ﬁnd they had a friend within the place, who might, in the moment of need, be able to facilitatetheir entrance, and readily agreed with the Saxon that a storm, under whatever disadvantages, ought to be attempted, as the only meansof liberating the prisoners now in the hands of the cruel Front-de-Bœuf.“The royal blood of Alfred is endangered,” said Cedric.“The honour of a noble lady is in peril,” said the Black Knight.“And, by the Saint Christopher at my baldric,” said the good yeoman, “were there no other cause than the safety of that poor faithfulknave, Wamba, I would jeopard a joint ere a hair of his head were hurt.”“And so would I,” said the Friar; “what, sirs! I trust well that a fool—I mean, d’ye see me, sirs, a fool that is free of his guild andmaster of his craft, and can give as much relish and ﬂavour to a cup of wine as ever a ﬂitch of bacon can—I say, brethren, such a foolshall never want a wise clerk to pray for or ﬁght for him at a strait, while I can say a mass or ﬂourish a partisan.” And with that hemade his heavy halberd to play around his head as a shepherd boy ﬂourishes his light crook.“True, Holy Clerk,” said the Black Knight, “true as if Saint Dunstan himself had said it.—And now, good Locksley, were it not wellthat noble Cedric should assume the direction of this assault?”“Not a jot I,” returned Cedric; “I have never been wont to study either how to take or how to hold out those abodes of tyrannicpower, which the Normans have erected in this groaning land. I will ﬁght among the foremost; but my honest neighbours well know Iam not a trained soldier in the discipline of wars, or the attack of strongholds.”“Since it stands thus with noble Cedric,” said Locksley, “I am most willing to take on me the direction of the archery; and ye shallhang me up on my own Trysting-tree, an the defenders be permitted to show themselves over the walls without being stuck with asmany shafts as there are cloves in a gammon of bacon at Christmas.”“Well said, stout yeoman,” answered the Black Knight; “and if I be thought worthy to have a charge in these matters, and can ﬁndamong these brave men as many as are willing to follow a true English knight, for so I may surely call myself, I am ready, with suchskill as my experience has taught me, to lead them to the attack of these walls.”The parts being thus distributed to the leaders, they commenced the ﬁrst assault, of which the reader has already heard the issue.When the barbican was carried, the Sable Knight sent notice of the happy event to Locksley, requesting him at the same time, tokeep such a strict observation on the castle as might prevent the defenders from combining their force for a sudden sally, andrecovering the outwork which they had lost. This the knight was chieﬂy desirous of avoiding, conscious that the men whom he led,being hasty and untrained volunteers, imperfectly armed and unaccustomed to discipline, must, upon any sudden attack, ﬁght at greatdisadvantage with the veteran soldiers of the Norman knights, who were well provided with arms both defensive and offensive; andwho, to match the zeal and high spirit of the besiegers, had all the conﬁdence which arises from perfect discipline and the habitual useof weapons.The knight employed the interval in causing to be constructed a sort of ﬂoating bridge, or long raft, by means of which he hoped tocross the moat in despite of the resistance of the enemy. This was a work of some time, which the leaders the less regretted, as it gaveUlrica leisure to execute her plan of diversion in their favour, whatever that might be.When the raft was completed, the Black Knight addressed the besiegers:—“It avails not waiting here longer, my friends; the sun isdescending to the west—and I have that upon my hands which will not permit me to tarry with you another day. Besides, it will be amarvel if the horsemen come not upon us from York, unless we speedily accomplish our purpose. Wherefore, one of ye go toLocksley, and bid him commence a discharge of arrows on the opposite side of the castle, and move forward as if about to assault it;and you, true English hearts, stand by me, and be ready to thrust the raft endlong over the moat whenever the postern on our side isthrown open. Follow me boldly across, and aid me to burst yon sallyport in the main wall of the castle. As many of you as like not thisservice, or are but ill armed to meet it, do you man the top of the outwork, draw your bow-strings to your ears, and mind you quellwith your shot whatever shall appear to man the rampart—Noble Cedric, wilt thou take the direction of those which remain?”“Not so, by the soul of Hereward!” said the Saxon; “lead I cannot; but may posterity curse me in my grave, if I follow not with theforemost wherever thou shalt point the way—The quarrel is mine, and well it becomes me to be in the van of the battle.”“Yet, bethink thee, noble Saxon,” said the knight, “thou hast neither hauberk, nor corslet, nor aught but that light helmet, target, andsword.”“The better!” answered Cedric; “I shall be the lighter to climb these walls. And,—forgive the boast, Sir Knight,—thou shalt this daysee the naked breast of a Saxon as boldly presented to the battle as ever ye beheld the steel corslet of a Norman.”“In the name of God, then,” said the knight, “ﬂing open the door, and launch the ﬂoating bridge.”The portal, which led from the inner-wall of the barbican to the moat, and which corresponded with a sallyport in the main wall ofthe castle, was now suddenly opened; the temporary bridge was then thrust forward, and soon ﬂashed in the waters, extending itslength between the castle and outwork, and forming a slippery and precarious passage for two men abreast to cross the moat. Wellaware of the importance of taking the foe by surprise, the Black Knight, closely followed by Cedric, threw himself upon the bridge,and reached the opposite side. Here he began to thunder with his axe upon the gate of the castle, protected in part from the shot andstones cast by the defenders by the ruins of the former drawbridge, which the Templar had demolished in his retreat from the barbican,leaving the counterpoise still attached to the upper part of the portal. The followers of the knight had no such shelter; two wereinstantly shot with cross-bow bolts, and two more fell into the moat; the others retreated back into the barbican.The situation of Cedric and of the Black Knight was now truly dangerous, and would have been still more so, but for the constancyof the archers in the barbican, who ceased not to shower their arrows upon the battlements, distracting the attention of those by whomthey were manned, and thus affording a respite to their two chiefs from the storm of missiles which must otherwise have overwhelmedthem. But their situation was eminently perilous, and was becoming more so with every moment.“Shame on ye all!” cried De Bracy to the soldiers around him; “do ye call yourselves cross-bowmen, and let these two dogs keeptheir station under the walls of the castle?—Heave over the coping stones from the battlements, an better may not be—Get pick-axeand levers, and down with that huge pinnacle!” pointing to a heavy piece of stone carved-work that projected from the parapet.At this moment the besiegers caught sight of the red ﬂag upon the angle of the tower which Ulrica had described to Cedric. Thestout yeoman Locksley was the ﬁrst who was aware of it, as he was hasting to the outwork, impatient to see the progress of the assault.“Saint George!” he cried, “Merry Saint George for England!—To the charge, bold yeomen!—why leave ye the good knight andnoble Cedric to storm the pass alone?—make in, mad priest, show thou canst ﬁght for thy rosary,—make in, brave yeomen!—thecastle is ours, we have friends within—See yonder ﬂag, it is the appointed signal—Torquilstone is ours!—Think of honour, think ofspoil—One effort, and the place is ours!”With that he bent his good bow, and sent a shaft right through the breast of one of the men-at-arms, who, under De Bracy’sdirection, was loosening a fragment from one of the battlements to precipitate on the heads of Cedric and the Black Knight. A secondsoldier caught from the hands of the dying man the iron crow, with which he heaved at and had loosened the stone pinnacle, when,receiving an arrow through his head-piece, he dropped from the battlements into the moat a dead man. The men-at-arms were daunted,for no armour seemed proof against the shot of this tremendous archer.“Do you give ground, base knaves!” said De Bracy; “‘Mount joye Saint Dennis!’—Give me the lever!”And, snatching it up, he again assailed the loosened pinnacle, which was of weight enough, if thrown down, not only to havedestroyed the remnant of the drawbridge, which sheltered the two foremost assailants, but also to have sunk the rude ﬂoat of planksover which they had crossed. All saw the danger, and the boldest, even the stout Friar himself, avoided setting foot on the raft. Thricedid Locksley bend his shaft against De Bracy, and thrice did his arrow bound back from the knight’s armour of proof.“Curse on thy Spanish steel-coat!” said Locksley, “had English smith forged it, these arrows had gone through, an as if it had beensilk or sendal.” He then began to call out, “Comrades! friends! noble Cedric! bear back, and let the ruin fall.”His warning voice was unheard, for the din which the knight himself occasioned by his strokes upon the postern would havedrowned twenty war-trumpets. The faithful Gurth indeed sprung forward on the planked bridge, to warn Cedric of his impending fate,or to share it with him. But his warning would have come too late; the massive pinnacle already tottered, and De Bracy, who stillheaved at his task, would have accomplished it, had not the voice of the Templar sounded close in his ears:—“All is lost, De Bracy, the castle burns.”“Thou art mad to say so!” replied the knight.“It is all in a light ﬂame on the western side. I have striven in vain to extinguish it.”With the stern coolness which formed the basis of his character, Brian de Bois-Guilbert communicated this hideous intelligence,which was not so calmly received by his astonished comrade.“Saints of Paradise!” said De Bracy; “what is to be done? I vow to Saint Nicholas of Limoges a candlestick of pure gold—”“Spare thy vow,” said the Templar, “and mark me. Lead thy men down, as if to a sally; throw the postern-gate open—There are buttwo men who occupy the ﬂoat, ﬂing them into the moat, and push across for the barbican. I will charge from the main gate, and attackthe barbican on the outside; and if we can regain that post, be assured we shall defend ourselves until we are relieved, or at least tillthey grant us fair quarter.”“It is well thought upon,” said De Bracy; “I will play my part—Templar, thou wilt not fail me?”“Hand and glove, I will not!” said Bois-Guilbert. “But haste thee, in the name of God!”De Bracy hastily drew his men together, and rushed down to the postern-gate, which he caused instantly to be thrown open. Butscarce was this done ere the portentous strength of the Black Knight forced his way inward in despite of De Bracy and his followers.Two of the foremost instantly fell, and the rest gave way notwithstanding all their leader’s efforts to stop them.“Dogs!” said De Bracy, “will ye let TWO men win our only pass for safety?”“He is the devil!” said a veteran man-at-arms, bearing back from the blows of their sable antagonist.“And if he be the devil,” replied De Bracy, “would you ﬂy from him into the mouth of hell?—the castle burns behind us, villains!—let despair give you courage, or let me forward! I will cope with this champion myself.”And well and chivalrous did De Bracy that day maintain the fame he had acquired in the civil wars of that dreadful period. Thevaulted passage to which the postern gave entrance, and in which these two redoubted champions were now ﬁghting hand to hand,rung with the furious blows which they dealt each other, De Bracy with his sword, the Black Knight with his ponderous axe. At lengththe Norman received a blow, which, though its force was partly parried by his shield, for otherwise never more would De Bracy haveagain moved limb, descended yet with such violence on his crest, that he measured his length on the paved ﬂoor.“Yield thee, De Bracy,” said the Black Champion, stooping over him, and holding against the bars of his helmet the fatal poniardwith which the knights dispatched their enemies, (and which was called the dagger of mercy,)—“yield thee, Maurice de Bracy, rescueor no rescue, or thou art but a dead man.”“I will not yield,” replied De Bracy faintly, “to an unknown conqueror. Tell me thy name, or work thy pleasure on me—it shallnever be said that Maurice de Bracy was prisoner to a nameless churl.”The Black Knight whispered something into the ear of the vanquished.“I yield me to be true prisoner, rescue or no rescue,” answered the Norman, exchanging his tone of stern and determined obstinacyfor one of deep though sullen submission.“Go to the barbican,” said the victor, in a tone of authority, “and there wait my further orders.”“Yet ﬁrst, let me say,” said De Bracy, “what it imports thee to know. Wilfred of Ivanhoe is wounded and a prisoner, and will perishin the burning castle without present help.”“Wilfred of Ivanhoe!” exclaimed the Black Knight—“prisoner, and perish!—The life of every man in the castle shall answer it if ahair of his head be singed—Show me his chamber!”“Ascend yonder winding stair,” said De Bracy; “it leads to his apartment—Wilt thou not accept my guidance?” he added, in asubmissive voice.“No. To the barbican, and there wait my orders. I trust thee not, De Bracy.”During this combat and the brief conversation which ensued, Cedric, at the head of a body of men, among whom the Friar wasconspicuous, had pushed across the bridge as soon as they saw the postern open, and drove back the dispirited and despairingfollowers of De Bracy, of whom some asked quarter, some offered vain resistance, and the greater part ﬂed towards the court-yard. DeBracy himself arose from the ground, and cast a sorrowful glance after his conqueror. “He trusts me not!” he repeated; “but have Ideserved his trust?” He then lifted his sword from the ﬂoor, took off his helmet in token of submission, and, going to the barbican,gave up his sword to Locksley, whom he met by the way.As the ﬁre augmented, symptoms of it became soon apparent in the chamber, where Ivanhoe was watched and tended by the JewessRebecca. He had been awakened from his brief slumber by the noise of the battle; and his attendant, who had, at his anxious desire,again placed herself at the window to watch and report to him the fate of the attack, was for some time prevented from observingeither, by the increase of the smouldering and stiﬂing vapour. At length the volumes of smoke which rolled into the apartment—thecries for water, which were heard even above the din of the battle made them sensible of the progress of this new danger.“The castle burns,” said Rebecca; “it burns!—What can we do to save ourselves?”“Fly, Rebecca, and save thine own life,” said Ivanhoe, “for no human aid can avail me.”“I will not ﬂy,” answered Rebecca; “we will be saved or perish together—And yet, great God!—my father, my father—what will behis fate!”At this moment the door of the apartment ﬂew open, and the Templar presented himself,—a ghastly ﬁgure, for his gilded armourwas broken and bloody, and the plume was partly shorn away, partly burnt from his casque. “I have found thee,” said he to Rebecca;“thou shalt prove I will keep my word to share weal and woe with thee—There is but one path to safety, I have cut my way throughﬁfty dangers to point it to thee—up, and instantly follow me!” 38“Alone,” answered Rebecca, “I will not follow thee. If thou wert born of woman—if thou hast but a touch of human charity in thee—if thy heart be not hard as thy breastplate—save my aged father—save this wounded knight!”“A knight,” answered the Templar, with his characteristic calmness, “a knight, Rebecca, must encounter his fate, whether it meethim in the shape of sword or ﬂame—and who recks how or where a Jew meets with his?”“Savage warrior,” said Rebecca, “rather will I perish in the ﬂames than accept safety from thee!”“Thou shalt not choose, Rebecca—once didst thou foil me, but never mortal did so twice.”So saying, he seized on the terriﬁed maiden, who ﬁlled the air with her shrieks, and bore her out of the room in his arms in spite ofher cries, and without regarding the menaces and deﬁance which Ivanhoe thundered against him. “Hound of the Temple—stain tothine Order—set free the damsel! Traitor of Bois-Guilbert, it is Ivanhoe commands thee!—Villain, I will have thy heart’s blood!”
“I had not found thee, Wilfred,” said the Black Knight, who at that instant entered the apartment, “but for thy shouts.”“If thou be’st true knight,” said Wilfred, “think not of me—pursue yon ravisher—save the Lady Rowena—look to the nobleCedric!”“In their turn,” answered he of the Fetterlock, “but thine is ﬁrst.”And seizing upon Ivanhoe, he bore him off with as much ease as the Templar had carried off Rebecca, rushed with him to thepostern, and having there delivered his burden to the care of two yeomen, he again entered the castle to assist in the rescue of the otherprisoners.One turret was now in bright ﬂames, which ﬂashed out furiously from window and shot-hole. But in other parts, the great thicknessof the walls and the vaulted roofs of the apartments, resisted the progress of the ﬂames, and there the rage of man still triumphed, asthe scarce more dreadful element held mastery elsewhere; for the besiegers pursued the defenders of the castle from chamber tochamber, and satiated in their blood the vengeance which had long animated them against the soldiers of the tyrant Front-de-Bœuf.Most of the garrison resisted to the uttermost—few of them asked quarter—none received it. The air was ﬁlled with groans andclashing of arms—the ﬂoors were slippery with the blood of despairing and expiring wretches.Through this scene of confusion, Cedric rushed in quest of Rowena, while the faithful Gurth, following him closely through the“melee”, neglected his own safety while he strove to avert the blows that were aimed at his master. The noble Saxon was so fortunateas to reach his ward’s apartment just as she had abandoned all hope of safety, and, with a cruciﬁx clasped in agony to her bosom, sat inexpectation of instant death. He committed her to the charge of Gurth, to be conducted in safety to the barbican, the road to which wasnow cleared of the enemy, and not yet interrupted by the ﬂames. This accomplished, the loyal Cedric hastened in quest of his friendAthelstane, determined, at every risk to himself, to save that last scion of Saxon royalty. But ere Cedric penetrated as far as the old hallin which he had himself been a prisoner, the inventive genius of Wamba had procured liberation for himself and his companion inadversity.When the noise of the conﬂict announced that it was at the hottest, the Jester began to shout, with the utmost power of his lungs,“Saint George and the dragon!—Bonny Saint George for merry England!—The castle is won!” And these sounds he rendered yetmore fearful, by banging against each other two or three pieces of rusty armour which lay scattered around the hall.A guard, which had been stationed in the outer, or anteroom, and whose spirits were already in a state of alarm, took fright atWamba’s clamour, and, leaving the door open behind them, ran to tell the Templar that foemen had entered the old hall. Meantime theprisoners found no difﬁculty in making their escape into the anteroom, and from thence into the court of the castle, which was now thelast scene of contest. Here sat the ﬁerce Templar, mounted on horseback, surrounded by several of the garrison both on horse and foot,who had united their strength to that of this renowned leader, in order to secure the last chance of safety and retreat which remained tothem. The drawbridge had been lowered by his orders, but the passage was beset; for the archers, who had hitherto only annoyed thecastle on that side by their missiles, no sooner saw the ﬂames breaking out, and the bridge lowered, than they thronged to the entrance,as well to prevent the escape of the garrison, as to secure their own share of booty ere the castle should be burnt down. On the otherhand, a party of the besiegers who had entered by the postern were now issuing out into the court-yard, and attacking with fury theremnant of the defenders who were thus assaulted on both sides at once.Animated, however, by despair, and supported by the example of their indomitable leader, the remaining soldiers of the castlefought with the utmost valour; and, being well-armed, succeeded more than once in driving back the assailants, though much inferiorin numbers. Rebecca, placed on horseback before one of the Templar’s Saracen slaves, was in the midst of the little party; and Bois-Guilbert, notwithstanding the confusion of the bloody fray, showed every attention to her safety. Repeatedly he was by her side, and,neglecting his own defence, held before her the fence of his triangular steel-plated shield; and anon starting from his position by her,he cried his war-cry, dashed forward, struck to earth the most forward of the assailants, and was on the same instant once more at herbridle rein.Athelstane, who, as the reader knows, was slothful, but not cowardly, beheld the female form whom the Templar protected thussedulously, and doubted not that it was Rowena whom the knight was carrying off, in despite of all resistance which could be offered.“By the soul of Saint Edward,” he said, “I will rescue her from yonder over-proud knight, and he shall die by my hand!”“Think what you do!” cried Wamba; “hasty hand catches frog for ﬁsh—by my bauble, yonder is none of my Lady Rowena—see buther long dark locks!—Nay, an ye will not know black from white, ye may be leader, but I will be no follower—no bones of mine shallbe broken unless I know for whom.—And you without armour too!—Bethink you, silk bonnet never kept out steel blade.—Nay, then,if wilful will to water, wilful must drench.—‘Deus vobiscum’, most doughty Athelstane!”—he concluded, loosening the hold whichhe had hitherto kept upon the Saxon’s tunic.To snatch a mace from the pavement, on which it lay beside one whose dying grasp had just relinquished it—to rush on theTemplar’s band, and to strike in quick succession to the right and left, levelling a warrior at each blow, was, for Athelstane’s greatstrength, now animated with unusual fury, but the work of a single moment; he was soon within two yards of Bois-Guilbert, whom hedeﬁed in his loudest tone.“Turn, false-hearted Templar! let go her whom thou art unworthy to touch—turn, limb of a hand of murdering and hypocriticalrobbers!”“Dog!” said the Templar, grinding his teeth, “I will teach thee to blaspheme the holy Order of the Temple of Zion;” and with thesewords, half-wheeling his steed, he made a demi-courbette towards the Saxon, and rising in the stirrups, so as to take full advantage ofthe descent of the horse, he discharged a fearful blow upon the head of Athelstane.Well said Wamba, that silken bonnet keeps out no steel blade. So trenchant was the Templar’s weapon, that it shore asunder, as ithad been a willow twig, the tough and plaited handle of the mace, which the ill-fated Saxon reared to parry the blow, and, descendingon his head, levelled him with the earth.“‘Ha! Beau-seant!’” exclaimed Bois-Guilbert, “thus be it to the maligners of the Temple-knights!” Taking advantage of the dismaywhich was spread by the fall of Athelstane, and calling aloud, “Those who would save themselves, follow me!” he pushed across thedrawbridge, dispersing the archers who would have intercepted them. He was followed by his Saracens, and some ﬁve or six men-at-arms, who had mounted their horses. The Templar’s retreat was rendered perilous by the numbers of arrows shot off at him and hisparty; but this did not prevent him from galloping round to the barbican, of which, according to his previous plan, he supposed itpossible De Bracy might have been in possession.“De Bracy! De Bracy!” he shouted, “art thou there?”“I am here,” replied De Bracy, “but I am a prisoner.”“Can I rescue thee?” cried Bois-Guilbert.“No,” replied De Bracy; “I have rendered me, rescue or no rescue. I will be true prisoner. Save thyself—there are hawks abroad—put the seas betwixt you and England—I dare not say more.”“Well,” answered the Templar, “an thou wilt tarry there, remember I have redeemed word and glove. Be the hawks where they will,methinks the walls of the Preceptory of Templestowe will be cover sufﬁcient, and thither will I, like heron to her haunt.”Having thus spoken, he galloped off with his followers.Those of the castle who had not gotten to horse, still continued to ﬁght desperately with the besiegers, after the departure of theTemplar, but rather in despair of quarter than that they entertained any hope of escape. The ﬁre was spreading rapidly through all partsof the castle, when Ulrica, who had ﬁrst kindled it, appeared on a turret, in the guise of one of the ancient furies, yelling forth a war-song, such as was of yore raised on the ﬁeld of battle by the scalds of the yet heathen Saxons. Her long dishevelled grey hair ﬂew backfrom her uncovered head; the inebriating delight of gratiﬁed vengeance contended in her eyes with the ﬁre of insanity; and shebrandished the distaff which she held in her hand, as if she had been one of the Fatal Sisters, who spin and abridge the thread ofhuman life. Tradition has preserved some wild strophes of the barbarous hymn which she chanted wildly amid that scene of ﬁre and ofslaughter:—1.Whet the bright steel,Sons of the White Dragon!Kindle the torch,Daughter of Hengist!The steel glimmers not for the carving of the banquet,It is hard, broad, and sharply pointed;The torch goeth not to the bridal chamber,It steams and glitters blue with sulphur.Whet the steel, the raven croaks!Light the torch, Zernebock is yelling!Whet the steel, sons of the Dragon!Kindle the torch, daughter of Hengist!2.The black cloud is low over the thane’s castleThe eagle screams—he rides on its bosom.Scream not, grey rider of the sable cloud,Thy banquet is prepared!The maidens of Valhalla look forth,The race of Hengist will send them guests.Shake your black tresses, maidens of Valhalla!And strike your loud timbrels for joy!Many a haughty step bends to your halls,Many a helmed head.3.Dark sits the evening upon the thanes castle,The black clouds gather round;Soon shall they be red as the blood of the valiant!The destroyer of forests shall shake his red crest againstthem.He, the bright consumer of palaces,Broad waves he his blazing banner,Red, wide and dusky,Over the strife of the valiant:His joy is in the clashing swords and broken bucklers;He loves to lick the hissing blood as it bursts warm from thewound!4.All must perish!The sword cleaveth the helmet;The strong armour is pierced by the lance;Fire devoureth the dwelling of princes,Engines break down the fences of the battle.All must perish!The race of Hengist is gone—The name of Horsa is no more!Shrink not then from your doom, sons of the sword!Let your blades drink blood like wine;Feast ye in the banquet of slaughter,By the light of the blazing halls!Strong be your swords while your blood is warm,And spare neither for pity nor fear,For vengeance hath but an hour;Strong hate itself shall expireI also must perish! 39The towering ﬂames had now surmounted every obstruction, and rose to the evening skies one huge and burning beacon, seen farand wide through the adjacent country. Tower after tower crashed down, with blazing roof and rafter; and the combatants were drivenfrom the court-yard. The vanquished, of whom very few remained, scattered and escaped into the neighbouring wood. The victors,assembling in large bands, gazed with wonder, not unmixed with fear, upon the ﬂames, in which their own ranks and arms glanceddusky red. The maniac ﬁgure of the Saxon Ulrica was for a long time visible on the lofty stand she had chosen, tossing her armsabroad with wild exultation, as if she reined empress of the conﬂagration which she had raised. At length, with a terriﬁc crash, thewhole turret gave way, and she perished in the ﬂames which had consumed her tyrant. An awful pause of horror silenced each murmurof the armed spectators, who, for the space of several minutes, stirred not a ﬁnger, save to sign the cross. The voice of Locksley wasthen heard, “Shout, yeomen!—the den of tyrants is no more! Let each bring his spoil to our chosen place of rendezvous at theTrysting-tree in the Harthill-walk; for there at break of day will we make just partition among our own bands, together with ourworthy allies in this great deed of vengeance.”CHAPTER XXXII.Trust me each state must have its policies:Kingdoms have edicts, cities have their charters;Even the wild outlaw, in his forest-walk,Keeps yet some touch of civil discipline;For not since Adam wore his verdant apron,Hath man with man in social union dwelt,But laws were made to draw that union closer.OLD PLAYThe daylight had dawned upon the glades of the oak forest. The green boughs glittered with all their pearls of dew. The hind led herfawn from the covert of high fern to the more open walks of the greenwood, and no huntsman was there to watch or intercept thestately hart, as he paced at the head of the antler’d herd.The outlaws were all assembled around the Trysting-tree in the Harthill-walk, where they had spent the night in refreshingthemselves after the fatigues of the siege, some with wine, some with slumber, many with hearing and recounting the events of theday, and computing the heaps of plunder which their success had placed at the disposal of their Chief.The spoils were indeed very large; for, notwithstanding that much was consumed, a great deal of plate, rich armour, and splendidclothing, had been secured by the exertions of the dauntless outlaws, who could be appalled by no danger when such rewards were inview. Yet so strict were the laws of their society, that no one ventured to appropriate any part of the booty, which was brought into onecommon mass, to be at the disposal of their leader.The place of rendezvous was an aged oak; not however the same to which Locksley had conducted Gurth and Wamba in the earlierpart of the story, but one which was the centre of a silvan amphitheatre, within half a mile of the demolished castle of Torquilstone.Here Locksley assumed his seat—a throne of turf erected under the twisted branches of the huge oak, and the silvan followers weregathered around him. He assigned to the Black Knight a seat at his right hand, and to Cedric a place upon his left.“Pardon my freedom, noble sirs,” he said, “but in these glades I am monarch—they are my kingdom; and these my wild subjectswould reck but little of my power, were I, within my own dominions, to yield place to mortal man.—Now, sirs, who hath seen ourchaplain? where is our curtal Friar? A mass amongst Christian men best begins a busy morning.”—No one had seen the Clerk ofCopmanhurst. “Over gods forbode!” said the outlaw chief, “I trust the jolly priest hath but abidden by the wine-pot a thought too late.Who saw him since the castle was ta’en?”“I,” quoth the Miller, “marked him busy about the door of a cellar, swearing by each saint in the calendar he would taste the smackof Front-de-Bœuf’s Gascoigne wine.”“Now, the saints, as many as there be of them,” said the Captain, “forefend, lest he has drunk too deep of the wine-butts, andperished by the fall of the castle!—Away, Miller!—take with you enow of men, seek the place where you last saw him—throw waterfrom the moat on the scorching ruins—I will have them removed stone by stone ere I lose my curtal Friar.”The numbers who hastened to execute this duty, considering that an interesting division of spoil was about to take place, showedhow much the troop had at heart the safety of their spiritual father.“Meanwhile, let us proceed,” said Locksley; “for when this bold deed shall be sounded abroad, the bands of De Bracy, ofMalvoisin, and other allies of Front-de-Bœuf, will be in motion against us, and it were well for our safety that we retreat from thevicinity.—Noble Cedric,” he said, turning to the Saxon, “that spoil is divided into two portions; do thou make choice of that whichbest suits thee, to recompense thy people who were partakers with us in this adventure.”“Good yeoman,” said Cedric, “my heart is oppressed with sadness. The noble Athelstane of Coningsburgh is no more—the lastsprout of the sainted Confessor! Hopes have perished with him which can never return!—A sparkle hath been quenched by his blood,which no human breath can again rekindle! My people, save the few who are now with me, do but tarry my presence to transport hishonoured remains to their last mansion. The Lady Rowena is desirous to return to Rotherwood, and must be escorted by a sufﬁcientforce. I should, therefore, ere now, have left this place; and I waited—not to share the booty, for, so help me God and Saint Withold! asneither I nor any of mine will touch the value of a liard,—I waited but to render my thanks to thee and to thy bold yeomen, for the lifeand honour ye have saved.”“Nay, but,” said the chief Outlaw, “we did but half the work at most—take of the spoil what may reward your own neighbours andfollowers.”“I am rich enough to reward them from mine own wealth,” answered Cedric.“And some,” said Wamba, “have been wise enough to reward themselves; they do not march off empty-handed altogether. We donot all wear motley.”“They are welcome,” said Locksley; “our laws bind none but ourselves.”“But, thou, my poor knave,” said Cedric, turning about and embracing his Jester, “how shall I reward thee, who feared not to givethy body to chains and death instead of mine!—All forsook me, when the poor fool was faithful!”A tear stood in the eye of the rough Thane as he spoke—a mark of feeling which even the death of Athelstane had not extracted; butthere was something in the half-instinctive attachment of his clown, that waked his nature more keenly than even grief itself.“Nay,” said the Jester, extricating himself from master’s caress, “if you pay my service with the water of your eye, the Jester mustweep for company, and then what becomes of his vocation?—But, uncle, if you would indeed pleasure me, I pray you to pardon myplayfellow Gurth, who stole a week from your service to bestow it on your son.”“Pardon him!” exclaimed Cedric; “I will both pardon and reward him.—Kneel down, Gurth.”—The swineherd was in an instant athis master’s feet—“THEOW and ESNE 40 art thou no longer,” said Cedric touching him with a wand; “FOLKFREE and SACLESS 41art thou in town and from town, in the forest as in the ﬁeld. A hide of land I give to thee in my steads of Walbrugham, from me andmine to thee and thine aye and for ever; and God’s malison on his head who this gainsays!”No longer a serf, but a freeman and a landholder, Gurth sprung upon his feet, and twice bounded aloft to almost his own height fromthe ground. “A smith and a ﬁle,” he cried, “to do away the collar from the neck of a freeman!—Noble master! doubled is my strengthby your gift, and doubly will I ﬁght for you!—There is a free spirit in my breast—I am a man changed to myself and all around.—Ha,Fangs!” he continued,—for that faithful cur, seeing his master thus transported, began to jump upon him, to express his sympathy,—“knowest thou thy master still?”“Ay,” said Wamba, “Fangs and I still know thee, Gurth, though we must needs abide by the collar; it is only thou art likely to forgetboth us and thyself.”“I shall forget myself indeed ere I forget thee, true comrade,” said Gurth; “and were freedom ﬁt for thee, Wamba, the master wouldnot let thee want it.”“Nay,” said Wamba, “never think I envy thee, brother Gurth; the serf sits by the hall-ﬁre when the freeman must forth to the ﬁeld ofbattle—And what saith Oldhelm of Malmsbury—Better a fool at a feast than a wise man at a fray.”The tramp of horses was now heard, and the Lady Rowena appeared, surrounded by several riders, and a much stronger party offootmen, who joyfully shook their pikes and clashed their brown-bills for joy of her freedom. She herself, richly attired, and mountedon a dark chestnut palfrey, had recovered all the dignity of her manner, and only an unwonted degree of paleness showed thesufferings she had undergone. Her lovely brow, though sorrowful, bore on it a cast of reviving hope for the future, as well as ofgrateful thankfulness for the past deliverance—She knew that Ivanhoe was safe, and she knew that Athelstane was dead. The formerassurance ﬁlled her with the most sincere delight; and if she did not absolutely rejoice at the latter, she might be pardoned for feelingthe full advantage of being freed from further persecution on the only subject in which she had ever been contradicted by her guardianCedric.As Rowena bent her steed towards Locksley’s seat, that bold yeoman, with all his followers, rose to receive her, as if by a generalinstinct of courtesy. The blood rose to her cheeks, as, courteously waving her hand, and bending so low that her beautiful and loosetresses were for an instant mixed with the ﬂowing mane of her palfrey, she expressed in few but apt words her obligations and hergratitude to Locksley and her other deliverers.—“God bless you, brave men,” she concluded, “God and Our Lady bless you andrequite you for gallantly perilling yourselves in the cause of the oppressed!—If any of you should hunger, remember Rowena has food—if you should thirst, she has many a butt of wine and brown ale—and if the Normans drive ye from these walks, Rowena has forestsof her own, where her gallant deliverers may range at full freedom, and never ranger ask whose arrow hath struck down the deer.”“Thanks, gentle lady,” said Locksley; “thanks from my company and myself. But, to have saved you requites itself. We who walkthe greenwood do many a wild deed, and the Lady Rowena’s deliverance may be received as an atonement.”Again bowing from her palfrey, Rowena turned to depart; but pausing a moment, while Cedric, who was to attend her, was alsotaking his leave, she found herself unexpectedly close by the prisoner De Bracy. He stood under a tree in deep meditation, his armscrossed upon his breast, and Rowena was in hopes she might pass him unobserved. He looked up, however, and, when aware of herpresence, a deep ﬂush of shame suffused his handsome countenance. He stood a moment most irresolute; then, stepping forward, tookher palfrey by the rein, and bent his knee before her.“Will the Lady Rowena deign to cast an eye—on a captive knight—on a dishonoured soldier?”“Sir Knight,” answered Rowena, “in enterprises such as yours, the real dishonour lies not in failure, but in success.”“Conquest, lady, should soften the heart,” answered De Bracy; “let me but know that the Lady Rowena forgives the violenceoccasioned by an ill-fated passion, and she shall soon learn that De Bracy knows how to serve her in nobler ways.”“I forgive you, Sir Knight,” said Rowena, “as a Christian.”“That means,” said Wamba, “that she does not forgive him at all.”“But I can never forgive the misery and desolation your madness has occasioned,” continued Rowena.“Unloose your hold on the lady’s rein,” said Cedric, coming up. “By the bright sun above us, but it were shame, I would pin thee tothe earth with my javelin—but be well assured, thou shalt smart, Maurice de Bracy, for thy share in this foul deed.”“He threatens safely who threatens a prisoner,” said De Bracy; “but when had a Saxon any touch of courtesy?”Then retiring two steps backward, he permitted the lady to move on.Cedric, ere they departed, expressed his peculiar gratitude to the Black Champion, and earnestly entreated him to accompany him toRotherwood.“I know,” he said, “that ye errant knights desire to carry your fortunes on the point of your lance, and reck not of land or goods; butwar is a changeful mistress, and a home is sometimes desirable even to the champion whose trade is wandering. Thou hast earned onein the halls of Rotherwood, noble knight. Cedric has wealth enough to repair the injuries of fortune, and all he has is his deliverer’s—Come, therefore, to Rotherwood, not as a guest, but as a son or brother.”“Cedric has already made me rich,” said the Knight,—“he has taught me the value of Saxon virtue. To Rotherwood will I come,brave Saxon, and that speedily; but, as now, pressing matters of moment detain me from your halls. Peradventure when I come hither,I will ask such a boon as will put even thy generosity to the test.”“It is granted ere spoken out,” said Cedric, striking his ready hand into the gauntleted palm of the Black Knight,—“it is grantedalready, were it to affect half my fortune.”“Gage not thy promise so lightly,” said the Knight of the Fetterlock; “yet well I hope to gain the boon I shall ask. Meanwhile,adieu.”“I have but to say,” added the Saxon, “that, during the funeral rites of the noble Athelstane, I shall be an inhabitant of the halls of hiscastle of Coningsburgh—They will be open to all who choose to partake of the funeral banqueting; and, I speak in name of the nobleEdith, mother of the fallen prince, they will never be shut against him who laboured so bravely, though unsuccessfully, to saveAthelstane from Norman chains and Norman steel.”“Ay, ay,” said Wamba, who had resumed his attendance on his master, “rare feeding there will be—pity that the noble Athelstanecannot banquet at his own funeral.—But he,” continued the Jester, lifting up his eyes gravely, “is supping in Paradise, and doubtlessdoes honour to the cheer.”“Peace, and move on,” said Cedric, his anger at this untimely jest being checked by the recollection of Wamba’s recent services.Rowena waved a graceful adieu to him of the Fetterlock—the Saxon bade God speed him, and on they moved through a wide glade ofthe forest.They had scarce departed, ere a sudden procession moved from under the greenwood branches, swept slowly round the silvanamphitheatre, and took the same direction with Rowena and her followers. The priests of a neighbouring convent, in expectation of theample donation, or “soul-scat”, which Cedric had propined, attended upon the car in which the body of Athelstane was laid, and sanghymns as it was sadly and slowly borne on the shoulders of his vassals to his castle of Coningsburgh, to be there deposited in the graveof Hengist, from whom the deceased derived his long descent. Many of his vassals had assembled at the news of his death, andfollowed the bier with all the external marks, at least, of dejection and sorrow. Again the outlaws arose, and paid the same rude andspontaneous homage to death, which they had so lately rendered to beauty—the slow chant and mournful step of the priests broughtback to their remembrance such of their comrades as had fallen in the yesterday’s array. But such recollections dwell not long withthose who lead a life of danger and enterprise, and ere the sound of the death-hymn had died on the wind, the outlaws were againbusied in the distribution of their spoil.“Valiant knight,” said Locksley to the Black Champion, “without whose good heart and mighty arm our enterprise must altogetherhave failed, will it please you to take from that mass of spoil whatever may best serve to pleasure you, and to remind you of this myTrysting-tree?”“I accept the offer,” said the Knight, “as frankly as it is given; and I ask permission to dispose of Sir Maurice de Bracy at my ownpleasure.”“He is thine already,” said Locksley, “and well for him! else the tyrant had graced the highest bough of this oak, with as many of hisFree-Companions as we could gather, hanging thick as acorns around him.—But he is thy prisoner, and he is safe, though he had slainmy father.”“De Bracy,” said the Knight, “thou art free—depart. He whose prisoner thou art scorns to take mean revenge for what is past. Butbeware of the future, lest a worse thing befall thee.—Maurice de Bracy, I say BEWARE!”De Bracy bowed low and in silence, and was about to withdraw, when the yeomen burst at once into a shout of execration andderision. The proud knight instantly stopped, turned back, folded his arms, drew up his form to its full height, and exclaimed, “Peace,ye yelping curs! who open upon a cry which ye followed not when the stag was at bay—De Bracy scorns your censure as he woulddisdain your applause. To your brakes and caves, ye outlawed thieves! and be silent when aught knightly or noble is but spoken withina league of your fox-earths.”This ill-timed deﬁance might have procured for De Bracy a volley of arrows, but for the hasty and imperative interference of theoutlaw Chief. Meanwhile the knight caught a horse by the rein, for several which had been taken in the stables of Front-de-Bœuf stoodaccoutred around, and were a valuable part of the booty. He threw himself upon the saddle, and galloped off through the wood.When the bustle occasioned by this incident was somewhat composed, the chief Outlaw took from his neck the rich horn andbaldric which he had recently gained at the strife of archery near Ashby.“Noble knight.” he said to him of the Fetterlock, “if you disdain not to grace by your acceptance a bugle which an English yeomanhas once worn, this I will pray you to keep as a memorial of your gallant bearing—and if ye have aught to do, and, as happeneth oft toa gallant knight, ye chance to be hard bested in any forest between Trent and Tees, wind three mots 42 upon the horn thus, ‘Wa-sa-hoa!’ and it may well chance ye shall ﬁnd helpers and rescue.”He then gave breath to the bugle, and winded once and again the call which he described, until the knight had caught the notes.“Gramercy for the gift, bold yeoman,” said the Knight; “and better help than thine and thy rangers would I never seek, were it at myutmost need.” And then in his turn he winded the call till all the greenwood rang.“Well blown and clearly,” said the yeoman; “beshrew me an thou knowest not as much of woodcraft as of war!—thou hast been astriker of deer in thy day, I warrant.—Comrades, mark these three mots—it is the call of the Knight of the Fetterlock; and he whohears it, and hastens not to serve him at his need, I will have him scourged out of our band with his own bowstring.”“Long live our leader!” shouted the yeomen, “and long live the Black Knight of the Fetterlock!—May he soon use our service, toprove how readily it will be paid.”Locksley now proceeded to the distribution of the spoil, which he performed with the most laudable impartiality. A tenth part of thewhole was set apart for the church, and for pious uses; a portion was next allotted to a sort of public treasury; a part was assigned tothe widows and children of those who had fallen, or to be expended in masses for the souls of such as had left no surviving family.The rest was divided amongst the outlaws, according to their rank and merit, and the judgment of the Chief, on all such doubtfulquestions as occurred, was delivered with great shrewdness, and received with absolute submission. The Black Knight was not a littlesurprised to ﬁnd that men, in a state so lawless, were nevertheless among themselves so regularly and equitably governed, and all thathe observed added to his opinion of the justice and judgment of their leader.When each had taken his own proportion of the booty, and while the treasurer, accompanied by four tall yeomen, was transportingthat belonging to the state to some place of concealment or of security, the portion devoted to the church still remainedunappropriated.“I would,” said the leader, “we could hear tidings of our joyous chaplain—he was never wont to be absent when meat was to beblessed, or spoil to be parted; and it is his duty to take care of these the tithes of our successful enterprise. It may be the ofﬁce hashelped to cover some of his canonical irregularities. Also, I have a holy brother of his a prisoner at no great distance, and I would fainhave the Friar to help me to deal with him in due sort—I greatly misdoubt the safety of the bluff priest.”“I were right sorry for that,” said the Knight of the Fetterlock, “for I stand indebted to him for the joyous hospitality of a merrynight in his cell. Let us to the ruins of the castle; it may be we shall there learn some tidings of him.”While they thus spoke, a loud shout among the yeomen announced the arrival of him for whom they feared, as they learned fromthe stentorian voice of the Friar himself, long before they saw his burly person.“Make room, my merry-men!” he exclaimed; “room for your godly father and his prisoner—Cry welcome once more.—I come,noble leader, like an eagle with my prey in my clutch.”—And making his way through the ring, amidst the laughter of all around, heappeared in majestic triumph, his huge partisan in one hand, and in the other a halter, one end of which was fastened to the neck of theunfortunate Isaac of York, who, bent down by sorrow and terror, was dragged on by the victorious priest, who shouted aloud, “Whereis Allan-a-Dale, to chronicle me in a ballad, or if it were but a lay?—By Saint Hermangild, the jingling crowder is ever out of the waywhere there is an apt theme for exalting valour!”“Curtal Priest,” said the Captain, “thou hast been at a wet mass this morning, as early as it is. In the name of Saint Nicholas, whomhast thou got here?”“A captive to my sword and to my lance, noble Captain,” replied the Clerk of Copmanhurst; “to my bow and to my halberd, Ishould rather say; and yet I have redeemed him by my divinity from a worse captivity. Speak, Jew—have I not ransomed thee fromSathanas?—have I not taught thee thy ‘credo’, thy ‘pater’, and thine ‘Ave Maria’?—Did I not spend the whole night in drinking tothee, and in expounding of mysteries?”“For the love of God!” ejaculated the poor Jew, “will no one take me out of the keeping of this mad—I mean this holy man?”“How’s this, Jew?” said the Friar, with a menacing aspect; “dost thou recant, Jew?—Bethink thee, if thou dost relapse into thineinﬁdelity, though thou are not so tender as a suckling pig—I would I had one to break my fast upon—thou art not too tough to beroasted! Be conformable, Isaac, and repeat the words after me. ‘Ave Maria’!—”“Nay, we will have no profanation, mad Priest,” said Locksley; “let us rather hear where you found this prisoner of thine.”“By Saint Dunstan,” said the Friar, “I found him where I sought for better ware! I did step into the cellarage to see what might berescued there; for though a cup of burnt wine, with spice, be an evening’s drought for an emperor, it were waste, methought, to let somuch good liquor be mulled at once; and I had caught up one runlet of sack, and was coming to call more aid among these lazyknaves, who are ever to seek when a good deed is to be done, when I was avised of a strong door—Aha! thought I, here is the choicestjuice of all in this secret crypt; and the knave butler, being disturbed in his vocation, hath left the key in the door—In therefore I went,and found just nought besides a commodity of rusted chains and this dog of a Jew, who presently rendered himself my prisoner, rescueor no rescue. I did but refresh myself after the fatigue of the action, with the unbeliever, with one humming cup of sack, and wasproceeding to lead forth my captive, when, crash after crash, as with wild thunder-dint and levin-ﬁre, down toppled the masonry of anouter tower, (marry beshrew their hands that built it not the ﬁrmer!) and blocked up the passage. The roar of one falling towerfollowed another—I gave up thought of life; and deeming it a dishonour to one of my profession to pass out of this world in companywith a Jew, I heaved up my halberd to beat his brains out; but I took pity on his grey hairs, and judged it better to lay down thepartisan, and take up my spiritual weapon for his conversion. And truly, by the blessing of Saint Dunstan, the seed has been sown ingood soil; only that, with speaking to him of mysteries through the whole night, and being in a manner fasting, (for the few droughtsof sack which I sharpened my wits with were not worth marking,) my head is well-nigh dizzied, I trow.—But I was clean exhausted.—Gilbert and Wibbald know in what state they found me—quite and clean exhausted.”“We can bear witness,” said Gilbert; “for when we had cleared away the ruin, and by Saint Dunstan’s help lighted upon the dungeonstair, we found the runlet of sack half empty, the Jew half dead, and the Friar more than half—exhausted, as he calls it.”“Ye be knaves! ye lie!” retorted the offended Friar; “it was you and your gormandizing companions that drank up the sack, andcalled it your morning draught—I am a pagan, an I kept it not for the Captain’s own throat. But what recks it? The Jew is converted,and understands all I have told him, very nearly, if not altogether, as well as myself.”“Jew,” said the Captain, “is this true? hast thou renounced thine unbelief?”“May I so ﬁnd mercy in your eyes,” said the Jew, “as I know not one word which the reverend prelate spake to me all this fearfulnight. Alas! I was so distraught with agony, and fear, and grief, that had our holy father Abraham come to preach to me, he had foundbut a deaf listener.”“Thou liest, Jew, and thou knowest thou dost.” said the Friar; “I will remind thee of but one word of our conference—thou didstpromise to give all thy substance to our holy Order.”“So help me the Promise, fair sirs,” said Isaac, even more alarmed than before, “as no such sounds ever crossed my lips! Alas! I aman aged beggar’d man—I fear me a childless—have ruth on me, and let me go!”“Nay,” said the Friar, “if thou dost retract vows made in favour of holy Church, thou must do penance.”Accordingly, he raised his halberd, and would have laid the staff of it lustily on the Jew’s shoulders, had not the Black Knightstopped the blow, and thereby transferred the Holy Clerk’s resentment to himself.“By Saint Thomas of Kent,” said he, “an I buckle to my gear, I will teach thee, sir lazy lover, to mell with thine own matters,maugre thine iron case there!”“Nay, be not wroth with me,” said the Knight; “thou knowest I am thy sworn friend and comrade.”“I know no such thing,” answered the Friar; “and defy thee for a meddling coxcomb!”“Nay, but,” said the Knight, who seemed to take a pleasure in provoking his quondam host, “hast thou forgotten how, that for mysake (for I say nothing of the temptation of the ﬂagon and the pasty) thou didst break thy vow of fast and vigil?”“Truly, friend,” said the Friar, clenching his huge ﬁst, “I will bestow a buffet on thee.”“I accept of no such presents,” said the Knight; “I am content to take thy cuff 421 as a loan, but I will repay thee with usury as deepas ever thy prisoner there exacted in his trafﬁc.”“I will prove that presently,” said the Friar.“Hola!” cried the Captain, “what art thou after, mad Friar? brawling beneath our Trysting-tree?”“No brawling,” said the Knight, “it is but a friendly interchange of courtesy.—Friar, strike an thou darest—I will stand thy blow, ifthou wilt stand mine.”“Thou hast the advantage with that iron pot on thy head,” said the churchman; “but have at thee—Down thou goest, an thou wertGoliath of Gath in his brazen helmet.”The Friar bared his brawny arm up to the elbow, and putting his full strength to the blow, gave the Knight a buffet that might havefelled an ox. But his adversary stood ﬁrm as a rock. A loud shout was uttered by all the yeomen around; for the Clerk’s cuff wasproverbial amongst them, and there were few who, in jest or earnest, had not had the occasion to know its vigour.“Now, Priest,” said, the Knight, pulling off his gauntlet, “if I had vantage on my head, I will have none on my hand—stand fast as atrue man.”“‘Genam meam dedi vapulatori’—I have given my cheek to the smiter,” said the Priest; “an thou canst stir me from the spot, fellow,I will freely bestow on thee the Jew’s ransom.”So spoke the burly Priest, assuming, on his part, high deﬁance. But who may resist his fate? The buffet of the Knight was givenwith such strength and good-will, that the Friar rolled head over heels upon the plain, to the great amazement of all the spectators. Buthe arose neither angry nor crestfallen.“Brother,” said he to the Knight, “thou shouldst have used thy strength with more discretion. I had mumbled but a lame mass anthou hadst broken my jaw, for the piper plays ill that wants the nether chops. Nevertheless, there is my hand, in friendly witness, that Iwill exchange no more cuffs with thee, having been a loser by the barter. End now all unkindness. Let us put the Jew to ransom, sincethe leopard will not change his spots, and a Jew he will continue to be.”“The Priest,” said Clement, “is not half so conﬁdent of the Jew’s conversion, since he received that buffet on the ear.”“Go to, knave, what pratest thou of conversions?—what, is there no respect?—all masters and no men?—I tell thee, fellow, I wassomewhat totty when I received the good knight’s blow, or I had kept my ground under it. But an thou gibest more of it, thou shaltlearn I can give as well as take.”“Peace all!” said the Captain. “And thou, Jew, think of thy ransom; thou needest not to be told that thy race are held to be accursedin all Christian communities, and trust me that we cannot endure thy presence among us. Think, therefore, of an offer, while I examinea prisoner of another cast.”“Were many of Front-de-Bœuf’s men taken?” demanded the Black Knight.“None of note enough to be put to ransom,” answered the Captain; “a set of hilding fellows there were, whom we dismissed to ﬁndthem a new master—enough had been done for revenge and proﬁt; the bunch of them were not worth a cardecu. The prisoner I speakof is better booty—a jolly monk riding to visit his leman, an I may judge by his horse-gear and wearing apparel.—Here cometh theworthy prelate, as pert as a pyet.” And, between two yeomen, was brought before the silvan throne of the outlaw Chief, our old friend,Prior Aymer of Jorvaulx.CHAPTER XXXIII—-Flower of warriors,How is’t with Titus Lartius?MARCIUS.—As with a man busied about decrees,Condemning some to death and some to exile,Ransoming him or pitying, threatening the other.CORIOLANUSThe captive Abbot’s features and manners exhibited a whimsical mixture of offended pride, and deranged foppery and bodily terror.“Why, how now, my masters?” said he, with a voice in which all three emotions were blended. “What order is this among ye? Be yeTurks or Christians, that handle a churchman?—Know ye what it is, ‘manus imponere in servos Domini’? Ye have plundered mymails—torn my cope of curious cut lace, which might have served a cardinal!—Another in my place would have been at his‘excommunicabo vos’; but I am placible, and if ye order forth my palfreys, release my brethren, and restore my mails, tell down withall speed an hundred crowns to be expended in masses at the high altar of Jorvaulx Abbey, and make your vow to eat no venison untilnext Pentecost, it may be you shall hear little more of this mad frolic.”“Holy Father,” said the chief Outlaw, “it grieves me to think that you have met with such usage from any of my followers, as callsfor your fatherly reprehension.”“Usage!” echoed the priest, encouraged by the mild tone of the silvan leader; “it were usage ﬁt for no hound of good race—muchless for a Christian—far less for a priest—and least of all for the Prior of the holy community of Jorvaulx. Here is a profane anddrunken minstrel, called Allan-a-Dale—‘nebulo quidam’—who has menaced me with corporal punishment—nay, with death itself, anI pay not down four hundred crowns of ransom, to the boot of all the treasure he hath already robbed me of—gold chains and gymmalrings to an unknown value; besides what is broken and spoiled among their rude hands, such as my pouncer-box and silver crisping-tongs.”“It is impossible that Allan-a-Dale can have thus treated a man of your reverend bearing,” replied the Captain.“It is true as the gospel of Saint Nicodemus,” said the Prior; “he swore, with many a cruel north-country oath, that he would hangme up on the highest tree in the greenwood.”“Did he so in very deed? Nay, then, reverend father, I think you had better comply with his demands—for Allan-a-Dale is the veryman to abide by his word when he has so pledged it.” 43“You do but jest with me,” said the astounded Prior, with a forced laugh; “and I love a good jest with all my heart. But, ha! ha! ha!when the mirth has lasted the livelong night, it is time to be grave in the morning.”“And I am as grave as a father confessor,” replied the Outlaw; “you must pay a round ransom, Sir Prior, or your convent is likely tobe called to a new election; for your place will know you no more.”“Are ye Christians,” said the Prior, “and hold this language to a churchman?”“Christians! ay, marry are we, and have divinity among us to boot,” answered the Outlaw. “Let our buxom chaplain stand forth, andexpound to this reverend father the texts which concern this matter.”The Friar, half-drunk, half-sober, had huddled a friar’s frock over his green cassock, and now summoning together whatever scrapsof learning he had acquired by rote in former days, “Holy father,” said he, “‘Deus faciat salvam benignitatem vestram’—You arewelcome to the greenwood.”“What profane mummery is this?” said the Prior. “Friend, if thou be’st indeed of the church, it were a better deed to show me how Imay escape from these men’s hands, than to stand ducking and grinning here like a morris-dancer.”“Truly, reverend father,” said the Friar, “I know but one mode in which thou mayst escape. This is Saint Andrew’s day with us, weare taking our tithes.”“But not of the church, then, I trust, my good brother?” said the Prior.“Of church and lay,” said the Friar; “and therefore, Sir Prior ‘facite vobis amicos de Mammone iniquitatis’—make yourselvesfriends of the Mammon of unrighteousness, for no other friendship is like to serve your turn.”“I love a jolly woodsman at heart,” said the Prior, softening his tone; “come, ye must not deal too hard with me—I can well ofwoodcraft, and can wind a horn clear and lustily, and hollo till every oak rings again—Come, ye must not deal too hard with me.”“Give him a horn,” said the Outlaw; “we will prove the skill he boasts of.”The Prior Aymer winded a blast accordingly. The Captain shook his head.“Sir Prior,” he said, “thou blowest a merry note, but it may not ransom thee—we cannot afford, as the legend on a good knight’sshield hath it, to set thee free for a blast. Moreover, I have found thee—thou art one of those, who, with new French graces and Tra-li-ras, disturb the ancient English bugle notes.—Prior, that last ﬂourish on the recheat hath added ﬁfty crowns to thy ransom, forcorrupting the true old manly blasts of venerie.”“Well, friend,” said the Abbot, peevishly, “thou art ill to please with thy woodcraft. I pray thee be more conformable in this matterof my ransom. At a word—since I must needs, for once, hold a candle to the devil—what ransom am I to pay for walking on Watling-street, without having ﬁfty men at my back?”“Were it not well,” said the Lieutenant of the gang apart to the Captain, “that the Prior should name the Jew’s ransom, and the Jewname the Prior’s?”“Thou art a mad knave,” said the Captain, “but thy plan transcends!—Here, Jew, step forth—Look at that holy Father Aymer, Priorof the rich Abbey of Jorvaulx, and tell us at what ransom we should hold him?—Thou knowest the income of his convent, I warrantthee.”“O, assuredly,” said Isaac. “I have trafﬁcked with the good fathers, and bought wheat and barley, and fruits of the earth, and alsomuch wool. O, it is a rich abbey-stede, and they do live upon the fat, and drink the sweet wines upon the lees, these good fathers ofJorvaulx. Ah, if an outcast like me had such a home to go to, and such incomings by the year and by the month, I would pay muchgold and silver to redeem my captivity.”“Hound of a Jew!” exclaimed the Prior, “no one knows better than thy own cursed self, that our holy house of God is indebted forthe ﬁnishing of our chancel—”“And for the storing of your cellars in the last season with the due allowance of Gascon wine,” interrupted the Jew; “but that—thatis small matters.”“Hear the inﬁdel dog!” said the churchman; “he jangles as if our holy community did come under debts for the wines we have alicense to drink, ‘propter necessitatem, et ad frigus depellendum’. The circumcised villain blasphemeth the holy church, and Christianmen listen and rebuke him not!”“All this helps nothing,” said the leader.—“Isaac, pronounce what he may pay, without ﬂaying both hide and hair.”“An six hundred crowns,” said Isaac, “the good Prior might well pay to your honoured valours, and never sit less soft in his stall.”“Six hundred crowns,” said the leader, gravely; “I am contented—thou hast well spoken, Isaac—six hundred crowns.—It is asentence, Sir Prior.”“A sentence!—a sentence!” exclaimed the band; “Solomon had not done it better.”“Thou hearest thy doom, Prior,” said the leader.“Ye are mad, my masters,” said the Prior; “where am I to ﬁnd such a sum? If I sell the very pyx and candlesticks on the altar atJorvaulx, I shall scarce raise the half; and it will be necessary for that purpose that I go to Jorvaulx myself; ye may retain as borrows 44my two priests.”“That will be but blind trust,” said the Outlaw; “we will retain thee, Prior, and send them to fetch thy ransom. Thou shalt not want acup of wine and a collop of venison the while; and if thou lovest woodcraft, thou shalt see such as your north country neverwitnessed.”“Or, if so please you,” said Isaac, willing to curry favour with the outlaws, “I can send to York for the six hundred crowns, out ofcertain monies in my hands, if so be that the most reverend Prior present will grant me a quittance.”“He shall grant thee whatever thou dost list, Isaac,” said the Captain; “and thou shalt lay down the redemption money for PriorAymer as well as for thyself.”“For myself! ah, courageous sirs,” said the Jew, “I am a broken and impoverished man; a beggar’s staff must be my portion throughlife, supposing I were to pay you ﬁfty crowns.”“The Prior shall judge of that matter,” replied the Captain.—“How say you, Father Aymer? Can the Jew afford a good ransom?”“Can he afford a ransom?” answered the Prior “Is he not Isaac of York, rich enough to redeem the captivity of the ten tribes ofIsrael, who were led into Assyrian bondage?—I have seen but little of him myself, but our cellarer and treasurer have dealt largelywith him, and report says that his house at York is so full of gold and silver as is a shame in any Christian land. Marvel it is to allliving Christian hearts that such gnawing adders should be suffered to eat into the bowels of the state, and even of the holy churchherself, with foul usuries and extortions.”“Hold, father,” said the Jew, “mitigate and assuage your choler. I pray of your reverence to remember that I force my monies uponno one. But when churchman and layman, prince and prior, knight and priest, come knocking to Isaac’s door, they borrow not hisshekels with these uncivil terms. It is then, Friend Isaac, will you pleasure us in this matter, and our day shall be truly kept, so God sa’me?—and Kind Isaac, if ever you served man, show yourself a friend in this need! And when the day comes, and I ask my own, thenwhat hear I but Damned Jew, and The curse of Egypt on your tribe, and all that may stir up the rude and uncivil populace against poorstrangers!”“Prior,” said the Captain, “Jew though he be, he hath in this spoken well. Do thou, therefore, name his ransom, as he named thine,without farther rude terms.”“None but ‘latro famosus’—the interpretation whereof,” said the Prior, “will I give at some other time and tide—would place aChristian prelate and an unbaptized Jew upon the same bench. But since ye require me to put a price upon this caitiff, I tell you openlythat ye will wrong yourselves if you take from him a penny under a thousand crowns.”“A sentence!—a sentence!” exclaimed the chief Outlaw.“A sentence!—a sentence!” shouted his assessors; “the Christian has shown his good nurture, and dealt with us more generouslythan the Jew.”“The God of my fathers help me!” said the Jew; “will ye bear to the ground an impoverished creature?—I am this day childless, andwill ye deprive me of the means of livelihood?”“Thou wilt have the less to provide for, Jew, if thou art childless,” said Aymer.“Alas! my lord,” said Isaac, “your law permits you not to know how the child of our bosom is entwined with the strings of our heart—O Rebecca! laughter of my beloved Rachel! were each leaf on that tree a zecchin, and each zecchin mine own, all that mass ofwealth would I give to know whether thou art alive, and escaped the hands of the Nazarene!”“Was not thy daughter dark-haired?” said one of the outlaws; “and wore she not a veil of twisted sendal, broidered with silver?”“She did!—she did!” said the old man, trembling with eagerness, as formerly with fear. “The blessing of Jacob be upon thee! canstthou tell me aught of her safety?”“It was she, then,” said the yeoman, “who was carried off by the proud Templar, when he broke through our ranks on yester-even. Ihad drawn my bow to send a shaft after him, but spared him even for the sake of the damsel, who I feared might take harm from thearrow.”“Oh!” answered the Jew, “I would to God thou hadst shot, though the arrow had pierced her bosom!—Better the tomb of her fathersthan the dishonourable couch of the licentious and savage Templar. Ichabod! Ichabod! the glory hath departed from my house!”“Friends,” said the Chief, looking round, “the old man is but a Jew, natheless his grief touches me.—Deal uprightly with us, Isaac—will paying this ransom of a thousand crowns leave thee altogether penniless?”Isaac, recalled to think of his worldly goods, the love of which, by dint of inveterate habit, contended even with his parentalaffection, grew pale, stammered, and could not deny there might be some small surplus.“Well—go to—what though there be,” said the Outlaw, “we will not reckon with thee too closely. Without treasure thou mayst aswell hope to redeem thy child from the clutches of Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert, as to shoot a stag-royal with a headless shaft.—We willtake thee at the same ransom with Prior Aymer, or rather at one hundred crowns lower, which hundred crowns shall be mine ownpeculiar loss, and not light upon this worshipful community; and so we shall avoid the heinous offence of rating a Jew merchant ashigh as a Christian prelate, and thou wilt have six hundred crowns remaining to treat for thy daughter’s ransom. Templars love theglitter of silver shekels as well as the sparkle of black eyes.—Hasten to make thy crowns chink in the ear of De Bois-Guilbert, ereworse comes of it. Thou wilt ﬁnd him, as our scouts have brought notice, at the next Preceptory house of his Order.—Said I well, mymerry mates?”The yeomen expressed their wonted acquiescence in their leader’s opinion; and Isaac, relieved of one half of his apprehensions, bylearning that his daughter lived, and might possibly be ransomed, threw himself at the feet of the generous Outlaw, and, rubbing hisbeard against his buskins, sought to kiss the hem of his green cassock. The Captain drew himself back, and extricated himself from theJew’s grasp, not without some marks of contempt.“Nay, beshrew thee, man, up with thee! I am English born, and love no such Eastern prostrations—Kneel to God, and not to a poorsinner, like me.”“Ay, Jew,” said Prior Aymer; “kneel to God, as represented in the servant of his altar, and who knows, with thy sincere repentanceand due gifts to the shrine of Saint Robert, what grace thou mayst acquire for thyself and thy daughter Rebecca? I grieve for themaiden, for she is of fair and comely countenance,—I beheld her in the lists of Ashby. Also Brian de Bois-Guilbert is one with whomI may do much—bethink thee how thou mayst deserve my good word with him.”“Alas! alas!” said the Jew, “on every hand the spoilers arise against me—I am given as a prey unto the Assyrian, and a prey untohim of Egypt.”“And what else should be the lot of thy accursed race?” answered the Prior; “for what saith holy writ, ‘verbum Domini projecerunt,et sapientia est nulla in eis’—they have cast forth the word of the Lord, and there is no wisdom in them; ‘propterea dabo muliereseorum exteris’—I will give their women to strangers, that is to the Templar, as in the present matter; ‘et thesauros eorum haeredibusalienis’, and their treasures to others—as in the present case to these honest gentlemen.”Isaac groaned deeply, and began to wring his hands, and to relapse into his state of desolation and despair. But the leader of theyeomen led him aside.“Advise thee well, Isaac,” said Locksley, “what thou wilt do in this matter; my counsel to thee is to make a friend of thischurchman. He is vain, Isaac, and he is covetous; at least he needs money to supply his profusion. Thou canst easily gratify his greed;for think not that I am blinded by thy pretexts of poverty. I am intimately acquainted, Isaac, with the very iron chest in which thou dostkeep thy money-bags—What! know I not the great stone beneath the apple-tree, that leads into the vaulted chamber under thy gardenat York?” The Jew grew as pale as death—“But fear nothing from me,” continued the yeoman, “for we are of old acquainted. Dostthou not remember the sick yeoman whom thy fair daughter Rebecca redeemed from the gyves at York, and kept him in thy house tillhis health was restored, when thou didst dismiss him recovered, and with a piece of money?—Usurer as thou art, thou didst neverplace coin at better interest than that poor silver mark, for it has this day saved thee ﬁve hundred crowns.”“And thou art he whom we called Diccon Bend-the-Bow?” said Isaac; “I thought ever I knew the accent of thy voice.”“I am Bend-the-Bow,” said the Captain, “and Locksley, and have a good name besides all these.”“But thou art mistaken, good Bend-the-Bow, concerning that same vaulted apartment. So help me Heaven, as there is nought in itbut some merchandises which I will gladly part with to you—one hundred yards of Lincoln green to make doublets to thy men, and ahundred staves of Spanish yew to make bows, and a hundred silken bowstrings, tough, round, and sound—these will I send thee forthy good-will, honest Diccon, an thou wilt keep silence about the vault, my good Diccon.”“Silent as a dormouse,” said the Outlaw; “and never trust me but I am grieved for thy daughter. But I may not help it—TheTemplars lances are too strong for my archery in the open ﬁeld—they would scatter us like dust. Had I but known it was Rebeccawhen she was borne off, something might have been done; but now thou must needs proceed by policy. Come, shall I treat for theewith the Prior?”“In God’s name, Diccon, an thou canst, aid me to recover the child of my bosom!”“Do not thou interrupt me with thine ill-timed avarice,” said the Outlaw, “and I will deal with him in thy behalf.”He then turned from the Jew, who followed him, however, as closely as his shadow.“Prior Aymer,” said the Captain, “come apart with me under this tree. Men say thou dost love wine, and a lady’s smile, better thanbeseems thy Order, Sir Priest; but with that I have nought to do. I have heard, too, thou dost love a brace of good dogs and a ﬂeethorse, and it may well be that, loving things which are costly to come by, thou hatest not a purse of gold. But I have never heard thatthou didst love oppression or cruelty.—Now, here is Isaac willing to give thee the means of pleasure and pastime in a bag containingone hundred marks of silver, if thy intercession with thine ally the Templar shall avail to procure the freedom of his daughter.”“In safety and honour, as when taken from me,” said the Jew, “otherwise it is no bargain.”“Peace, Isaac,” said the Outlaw, “or I give up thine interest.—What say you to this my purpose, Prior Aymer?”“The matter,” quoth the Prior, “is of a mixed condition; for, if I do a good deal on the one hand, yet, on the other, it goeth to thevantage of a Jew, and in so much is against my conscience. Yet, if the Israelite will advantage the Church by giving me somewhat overto the building of our dortour, 45 I will take it on my conscience to aid him in the matter of his daughter.”“For a score of marks to the dortour,” said the Outlaw,—“Be still, I say, Isaac!—or for a brace of silver candlesticks to the altar, wewill not stand with you.”“Nay, but, good Diccon Bend-the-Bow”—said Isaac, endeavouring to interpose.“Good Jew—good beast—good earthworm!” said the yeoman, losing patience; “an thou dost go on to put thy ﬁlthy lucre in thebalance with thy daughter’s life and honour, by Heaven, I will strip thee of every maravedi thou hast in the world, before three daysare out!”Isaac shrunk together, and was silent.“And what pledge am I to have for all this?” said the Prior.“When Isaac returns successful through your mediation,” said the Outlaw, “I swear by Saint Hubert, I will see that he pays thee themoney in good silver, or I will reckon with him for it in such sort, he had better have paid twenty such sums.”“Well then, Jew,” said Aymer, “since I must needs meddle in this matter, let me have the use of thy writing-tablets—though, hold—rather than use thy pen, I would fast for twenty-four hours, and where shall I ﬁnd one?”“If your holy scruples can dispense with using the Jew’s tablets, for the pen I can ﬁnd a remedy,” said the yeoman; and, bending hisbow, he aimed his shaft at a wild-goose which was soaring over their heads, the advanced-guard of a phalanx of his tribe, which werewinging their way to the distant and solitary fens of Holderness. The bird came ﬂuttering down, transﬁxed with the arrow.“There, Prior,” said the Captain, “are quills enow to supply all the monks of Jorvaulx for the next hundred years, an they take not towriting chronicles.”The Prior sat down, and at great leisure indited an epistle to Brian de Bois-Guilbert, and having carefully sealed up the tablets,delivered them to the Jew, saying, “This will be thy safe-conduct to the Preceptory of Templestowe, and, as I think, is most likely toaccomplish the delivery of thy daughter, if it be well backed with proffers of advantage and commodity at thine own hand; for, trustme well, the good Knight Bois-Guilbert is of their confraternity that do nought for nought.”“Well, Prior,” said the Outlaw, “I will detain thee no longer here than to give the Jew a quittance for the six hundred crowns atwhich thy ransom is ﬁxed—I accept of him for my pay-master; and if I hear that ye boggle at allowing him in his accompts the sum sopaid by him, Saint Mary refuse me, an I burn not the abbey over thine head, though I hang ten years the sooner!”With a much worse grace than that wherewith he had penned the letter to Bois-Guilbert, the Prior wrote an acquittance, dischargingIsaac of York of six hundred crowns, advanced to him in his need for acquittal of his ransom, and faithfully promising to hold truecompt with him for that sum.“And now,” said Prior Aymer, “I will pray you of restitution of my mules and palfreys, and the freedom of the reverend brethrenattending upon me, and also of the gymmal rings, jewels, and fair vestures, of which I have been despoiled, having now satisﬁed youfor my ransom as a true prisoner.”“Touching your brethren, Sir Prior,” said Locksley, “they shall have present freedom, it were unjust to detain them; touching yourhorses and mules, they shall also be restored, with such spending-money as may enable you to reach York, for it were cruel to depriveyou of the means of journeying.—But as concerning rings, jewels, chains, and what else, you must understand that we are men oftender consciences, and will not yield to a venerable man like yourself, who should be dead to the vanities of this life, the strongtemptation to break the rule of his foundation, by wearing rings, chains, or other vain gauds.”“Think what you do, my masters,” said the Prior, “ere you put your hand on the Church’s patrimony—These things are ‘inter ressacras’, and I wot not what judgment might ensue were they to be handled by laical hands.”“I will take care of that, reverend Prior,” said the Hermit of Copmanhurst; “for I will wear them myself.”“Friend, or brother,” said the Prior, in answer to this solution of his doubts, “if thou hast really taken religious orders, I pray thee tolook how thou wilt answer to thine ofﬁcial for the share thou hast taken in this day’s work.”“Friend Prior,” returned the Hermit, “you are to know that I belong to a little diocese, where I am my own diocesan, and care aslittle for the Bishop of York as I do for the Abbot of Jorvaulx, the Prior, and all the convent.”“Thou art utterly irregular,” said the Prior; “one of those disorderly men, who, taking on them the sacred character without duecause, profane the holy rites, and endanger the souls of those who take counsel at their hands; ‘lapides pro pane condonantes iis’,giving them stones instead of bread as the Vulgate hath it.”“Nay,” said the Friar, “an my brain-pan could have been broken by Latin, it had not held so long together.—I say, that easing aworld of such misproud priests as thou art of their jewels and their gimcracks, is a lawful spoiling of the Egyptians.”“Thou be’st a hedge-priest,” 46 said the Prior, in great wrath, “‘excommunicabo vos’.”“Thou be’st thyself more like a thief and a heretic,” said the Friar, equally indignant; “I will pouch up no such affront before myparishioners, as thou thinkest it not shame to put upon me, although I be a reverend brother to thee. ‘Ossa ejus perfringam’, I willbreak your bones, as the Vulgate hath it.”“Hola!” cried the Captain, “come the reverend brethren to such terms?—Keep thine assurance of peace, Friar.—Prior, an thou hastnot made thy peace perfect with God, provoke the Friar no further.—Hermit, let the reverend father depart in peace, as a ransomedman.”The yeomen separated the incensed priests, who continued to raise their voices, vituperating each other in bad Latin, which thePrior delivered the more ﬂuently, and the Hermit with the greater vehemence. The Prior at length recollected himself sufﬁciently to beaware that he was compromising his dignity, by squabbling with such a hedge-priest as the Outlaw’s chaplain, and being joined by hisattendants, rode off with considerably less pomp, and in a much more apostolical condition, so far as worldly matters were concerned,than he had exhibited before this rencounter.It remained that the Jew should produce some security for the ransom which he was to pay on the Prior’s account, as well as uponhis own. He gave, accordingly, an order sealed with his signet, to a brother of his tribe at York, requiring him to pay to the bearer thesum of a thousand crowns, and to deliver certain merchandises speciﬁed in the note.“My brother Sheva,” he said, groaning deeply, “hath the key of my warehouses.”“And of the vaulted chamber,” whispered Locksley.“No, no—may Heaven forefend!” said Isaac; “evil is the hour that let any one whomsoever into that secret!”“It is safe with me,” said the Outlaw, “so be that this thy scroll produce the sum therein nominated and set down.—But what now,Isaac? art dead? art stupeﬁed? hath the payment of a thousand crowns put thy daughter’s peril out of thy mind?”The Jew started to his feet—“No, Diccon, no—I will presently set forth.—Farewell, thou whom I may not call good, and dare notand will not call evil.”Yet ere Isaac departed, the Outlaw Chief bestowed on him this parting advice:—“Be liberal of thine offers, Isaac, and spare not thypurse for thy daughter’s safety. Credit me, that the gold thou shalt spare in her cause, will hereafter give thee as much agony as if itwere poured molten down thy throat.”Isaac acquiesced with a deep groan, and set forth on his journey, accompanied by two tall foresters, who were to be his guides, andat the same time his guards, through the wood.The Black Knight, who had seen with no small interest these various proceedings, now took his leave of the Outlaw in turn; norcould he avoid expressing his surprise at having witnessed so much of civil policy amongst persons cast out from all the ordinaryprotection and inﬂuence of the laws.“Good fruit, Sir Knight,” said the yeoman, “will sometimes grow on a sorry tree; and evil times are not always productive of evilalone and unmixed. Amongst those who are drawn into this lawless state, there are, doubtless, numbers who wish to exercise itslicense with some moderation, and some who regret, it may be, that they are obliged to follow such a trade at all.”“And to one of those,” said the Knight, “I am now, I presume, speaking?”“Sir Knight,” said the Outlaw, “we have each our secret. You are welcome to form your judgment of me, and I may use myconjectures touching you, though neither of our shafts may hit the mark they are shot at. But as I do not pray to be admitted into yourmystery, be not offended that I preserve my own.”“I crave pardon, brave Outlaw,” said the Knight, “your reproof is just. But it may be we shall meet hereafter with less ofconcealment on either side.—Meanwhile we part friends, do we not?”“There is my hand upon it,” said Locksley; “and I will call it the hand of a true Englishman, though an outlaw for the present.”“And there is mine in return,” said the Knight, “and I hold it honoured by being clasped with yours. For he that does good, havingthe unlimited power to do evil, deserves praise not only for the good which he performs, but for the evil which he forbears. Fare theewell, gallant Outlaw!” Thus parted that fair fellowship; and He of the Fetterlock, mounting upon his strong war-horse, rode offthrough the forest.CHAPTER XXXIVKING JOHN.—I’ll tell thee what, my friend,He is a very serpent in my way;And wheresoe’er this foot of mine doth tread,He lies before me.—Dost thou understand me?KING JOHNThere was brave feasting in the Castle of York, to which Prince John had invited those nobles, prelates, and leaders, by whoseassistance he hoped to carry through his ambitious projects upon his brother’s throne. Waldemar Fitzurse, his able and politic agent,was at secret work among them, tempering all to that pitch of courage which was necessary in making an open declaration of theirpurpose. But their enterprise was delayed by the absence of more than one main limb of the confederacy. The stubborn and daring,though brutal courage of Front-de-Bœuf; the buoyant spirits and bold bearing of De Bracy; the sagacity, martial experience, andrenowned valour of Brian de Bois-Guilbert, were important to the success of their conspiracy; and, while cursing in secret theirunnecessary and unmeaning absence, neither John nor his adviser dared to proceed without them. Isaac the Jew also seemed to havevanished, and with him the hope of certain sums of money, making up the subsidy for which Prince John had contracted with thatIsraelite and his brethren. This deﬁciency was likely to prove perilous in an emergency so critical.It was on the morning after the fall of Torquilstone, that a confused report began to spread abroad in the city of York, that De Bracyand Bois-Guilbert, with their confederate Front-de-Bœuf, had been taken or slain. Waldemar brought the rumour to Prince John,announcing, that he feared its truth the more that they had set out with a small attendance, for the purpose of committing an assault onthe Saxon Cedric and his attendants. At another time the Prince would have treated this deed of violence as a good jest; but now, that itinterfered with and impeded his own plans, he exclaimed against the perpetrators, and spoke of the broken laws, and the infringementof public order and of private property, in a tone which might have become King Alfred.“The unprincipled marauders,” he said—“were I ever to become monarch of England, I would hang such transgressors over thedrawbridges of their own castles.”“But to become monarch of England,” said his Ahithophel coolly, “it is necessary not only that your Grace should endure thetransgressions of these unprincipled marauders, but that you should afford them your protection, notwithstanding your laudable zealfor the laws they are in the habit of infringing. We shall be ﬁnely helped, if the churl Saxons should have realized your Grace’s vision,of converting feudal drawbridges into gibbets; and yonder bold-spirited Cedric seemeth one to whom such an imagination mightoccur. Your Grace is well aware, it will be dangerous to stir without Front-de-Bœuf, De Bracy, and the Templar; and yet we have gonetoo far to recede with safety.”Prince John struck his forehead with impatience, and then began to stride up and down the apartment.“The villains,” he said, “the base treacherous villains, to desert me at this pinch!”“Nay, say rather the feather-pated giddy madmen,” said Waldemar, “who must be toying with follies when such business was inhand.”“What is to be done?” said the Prince, stopping short before Waldemar.“I know nothing which can be done,” answered his counsellor, “save that which I have already taken order for.—I came not tobewail this evil chance with your Grace, until I had done my best to remedy it.”“Thou art ever my better angel, Waldemar,” said the Prince; “and when I have such a chancellor to advise withal, the reign of Johnwill be renowned in our annals.—What hast thou commanded?”“I have ordered Louis Winkelbrand, De Bracy’s lieutenant, to cause his trumpet sound to horse, and to display his banner, and to setpresently forth towards the castle of Front-de-Bœuf, to do what yet may be done for the succour of our friends.”Prince John’s face ﬂushed with the pride of a spoilt child, who has undergone what it conceives to be an insult. “By the face ofGod!” he said, “Waldemar Fitzurse, much hast thou taken upon thee! and over malapert thou wert to cause trumpet to blow, or bannerto be raised, in a town where ourselves were in presence, without our express command.”“I crave your Grace’s pardon,” said Fitzurse, internally cursing the idle vanity of his patron; “but when time pressed, and even theloss of minutes might be fatal, I judged it best to take this much burden upon me, in a matter of such importance to your Grace’sinterest.”“Thou art pardoned, Fitzurse,” said the prince, gravely; “thy purpose hath atoned for thy hasty rashness.—But whom have we here?—De Bracy himself, by the rood!—and in strange guise doth he come before us.”It was indeed De Bracy—“bloody with spurring, ﬁery red with speed.” His armour bore all the marks of the late obstinate fray,being broken, defaced, and stained with blood in many places, and covered with clay and dust from the crest to the spur. Undoing hishelmet, he placed it on the table, and stood a moment as if to collect himself before he told his news.“De Bracy,” said Prince John, “what means this?—Speak, I charge thee!—Are the Saxons in rebellion?”“Speak, De Bracy,” said Fitzurse, almost in the same moment with his master, “thou wert wont to be a man—Where is the Templar?—where Front-de-Bœuf?”“The Templar is ﬂed,” said De Bracy; “Front-de-Bœuf you will never see more. He has found a red grave among the blazing raftersof his own castle and I alone am escaped to tell you.”“Cold news,” said Waldemar, “to us, though you speak of ﬁre and conﬂagration.”“The worst news is not yet said,” answered De Bracy; and, coming up to Prince John, he uttered in a low and emphatic tone—“Richard is in England—I have seen and spoken with him.”Prince John turned pale, tottered, and caught at the back of an oaken bench to support himself—much like to a man who receives anarrow in his bosom.“Thou ravest, De Bracy,” said Fitzurse, “it cannot be.”“It is as true as truth itself,” said De Bracy; “I was his prisoner, and spoke with him.”“With Richard Plantagenet, sayest thou?” continued Fitzurse.“With Richard Plantagenet,” replied De Bracy, “with Richard Cœur-de-Lion—with Richard of England.”“And thou wert his prisoner?” said Waldemar; “he is then at the head of a power?”“No—only a few outlawed yeomen were around him, and to these his person is unknown. I heard him say he was about to departfrom them. He joined them only to assist at the storming of Torquilstone.”“Ay,” said Fitzurse, “such is indeed the fashion of Richard—a true knight-errant he, and will wander in wild adventure, trusting theprowess of his single arm, like any Sir Guy or Sir Bevis, while the weighty affairs of his kingdom slumber, and his own safety isendangered.—What dost thou propose to do De Bracy?”“I?—I offered Richard the service of my Free Lances, and he refused them—I will lead them to Hull, seize on shipping, and embarkfor Flanders; thanks to the bustling times, a man of action will always ﬁnd employment. And thou, Waldemar, wilt thou take lance andshield, and lay down thy policies, and wend along with me, and share the fate which God sends us?”“I am too old, Maurice, and I have a daughter,” answered Waldemar.“Give her to me, Fitzurse, and I will maintain her as ﬁts her rank, with the help of lance and stirrup,” said De Bracy.“Not so,” answered Fitzurse; “I will take sanctuary in this church of Saint Peter—the Archbishop is my sworn brother.”During this discourse, Prince John had gradually awakened from the stupor into which he had been thrown by the unexpectedintelligence, and had been attentive to the conversation which passed betwixt his followers. “They fall off from me,” he said tohimself, “they hold no more by me than a withered leaf by the bough when a breeze blows on it!—Hell and ﬁends! can I shape nomeans for myself when I am deserted by these cravens?”—He paused, and there was an expression of diabolical passion in theconstrained laugh with which he at length broke in on their conversation.“Ha, ha, ha! my good lords, by the light of Our Lady’s brow, I held ye sage men, bold men, ready-witted men; yet ye throw downwealth, honour, pleasure, all that our noble game promised you, at the moment it might be won by one bold cast!”“I understand you not,” said De Bracy. “As soon as Richard’s return is blown abroad, he will be at the head of an army, and all isthen over with us. I would counsel you, my lord, either to ﬂy to France or take the protection of the Queen Mother.”“I seek no safety for myself,” said Prince John, haughtily; “that I could secure by a word spoken to my brother. But although you,De Bracy, and you, Waldemar Fitzurse, are so ready to abandon me, I should not greatly delight to see your heads blackening onClifford’s gate yonder. Thinkest thou, Waldemar, that the wily Archbishop will not suffer thee to be taken from the very horns of thealtar, would it make his peace with King Richard? And forgettest thou, De Bracy, that Robert Estoteville lies betwixt thee and Hullwith all his forces, and that the Earl of Essex is gathering his followers? If we had reason to fear these levies even before Richard’sreturn, trowest thou there is any doubt now which party their leaders will take? Trust me, Estoteville alone has strength enough todrive all thy Free Lances into the Humber.”—Waldemar Fitzurse and De Bracy looked in each other’s faces with blank dismay.—“There is but one road to safety,” continued the Prince, and his brow grew black as midnight; “this object of our terror journeys alone—He must be met withal.”“Not by me,” said De Bracy, hastily; “I was his prisoner, and he took me to mercy. I will not harm a feather in his crest.”“Who spoke of harming him?” said Prince John, with a hardened laugh; “the knave will say next that I meant he should slay him!—No—a prison were better; and whether in Britain or Austria, what matters it?—Things will be but as they were when we commencedour enterprise—It was founded on the hope that Richard would remain a captive in Germany—Our uncle Robert lived and died in thecastle of Cardiffe.”“Ay, but,” said Waldemar, “your sire Henry sate more ﬁrm in his seat than your Grace can. I say the best prison is that which ismade by the sexton—no dungeon like a church-vault! I have said my say.”“Prison or tomb,” said De Bracy, “I wash my hands of the whole matter.”“Villain!” said Prince John, “thou wouldst not bewray our counsel?”“Counsel was never bewrayed by me,” said De Bracy, haughtily, “nor must the name of villain be coupled with mine!”“Peace, Sir Knight!” said Waldemar; “and you, good my lord, forgive the scruples of valiant De Bracy; I trust I shall soon removethem.”“That passes your eloquence, Fitzurse,” replied the Knight.“Why, good Sir Maurice,” rejoined the wily politician, “start not aside like a scared steed, without, at least, considering the object ofyour terror.—This Richard—but a day since, and it would have been thy dearest wish to have met him hand to hand in the ranks ofbattle—a hundred times I have heard thee wish it.”“Ay,” said De Bracy, “but that was as thou sayest, hand to hand, and in the ranks of battle! Thou never heardest me breathe athought of assaulting him alone, and in a forest.”“Thou art no good knight if thou dost scruple at it,” said Waldemar. “Was it in battle that Lancelot de Lac and Sir Tristram wonrenown? or was it not by encountering gigantic knights under the shade of deep and unknown forests?”“Ay, but I promise you,” said De Bracy, “that neither Tristram nor Lancelot would have been match, hand to hand, for RichardPlantagenet, and I think it was not their wont to take odds against a single man.”“Thou art mad, De Bracy—what is it we propose to thee, a hired and retained captain of Free Companions, whose swords arepurchased for Prince John’s service? Thou art apprized of our enemy, and then thou scruplest, though thy patron’s fortunes, those ofthy comrades, thine own, and the life and honour of every one amongst us, be at stake!”“I tell you,” said De Bracy, sullenly, “that he gave me my life. True, he sent me from his presence, and refused my homage—so far Iowe him neither favour nor allegiance—but I will not lift hand against him.”“It needs not—send Louis Winkelbrand and a score of thy lances.”“Ye have sufﬁcient rufﬁans of your own,” said De Bracy; “not one of mine shall budge on such an errand.”“Art thou so obstinate, De Bracy?” said Prince John; “and wilt thou forsake me, after so many protestations of zeal for my service?”“I mean it not,” said De Bracy; “I will abide by you in aught that becomes a knight, whether in the lists or in the camp; but thishighway practice comes not within my vow.”“Come hither, Waldemar,” said Prince John. “An unhappy prince am I. My father, King Henry, had faithful servants—He had but tosay that he was plagued with a factious priest, and the blood of Thomas-a-Becket, saint though he was, stained the steps of his ownaltar.—Tracy, Morville, Brito 47 loyal and daring subjects, your names, your spirit, are extinct! and although Reginald Fitzurse hathleft a son, he hath fallen off from his father’s ﬁdelity and courage.”“He has fallen off from neither,” said Waldemar Fitzurse; “and since it may not better be, I will take on me the conduct of thisperilous enterprise. Dearly, however, did my father purchase the praise of a zealous friend; and yet did his proof of loyalty to Henryfall far short of what I am about to afford; for rather would I assail a whole calendar of saints, than put spear in rest against Cœur-de-Lion.—De Bracy, to thee I must trust to keep up the spirits of the doubtful, and to guard Prince John’s person. If you receive suchnews as I trust to send you, our enterprise will no longer wear a doubtful aspect.—Page,” he said, “hie to my lodgings, and tell myarmourer to be there in readiness; and bid Stephen Wetheral, Broad Thoresby, and the Three Spears of Spyinghow, come to meinstantly; and let the scout-master, Hugh Bardon, attend me also.—Adieu, my Prince, till better times.” Thus speaking, he left theapartment. “He goes to make my brother prisoner,” said Prince John to De Bracy, “with as little touch of compunction, as if it butconcerned the liberty of a Saxon franklin. I trust he will observe our orders, and use our dear Richard’s person with all due respect.”De Bracy only answered by a smile.“By the light of Our Lady’s brow,” said Prince John, “our orders to him were most precise—though it may be you heard them not,as we stood together in the oriel window—Most clear and positive was our charge that Richard’s safety should be cared for, and woeto Waldemar’s head if he transgress it!”“I had better pass to his lodgings,” said De Bracy, “and make him fully aware of your Grace’s pleasure; for, as it quite escaped myear, it may not perchance have reached that of Waldemar.”“Nay, nay,” said Prince John, impatiently, “I promise thee he heard me; and, besides, I have farther occupation for thee. Maurice,come hither; let me lean on thy shoulder.”They walked a turn through the hall in this familiar posture, and Prince John, with an air of the most conﬁdential intimacy,proceeded to say, “What thinkest thou of this Waldemar Fitzurse, my De Bracy?—He trusts to be our Chancellor. Surely we will pauseere we give an ofﬁce so high to one who shows evidently how little he reverences our blood, by his so readily undertaking thisenterprise against Richard. Thou dost think, I warrant, that thou hast lost somewhat of our regard, by thy boldly declining thisunpleasing task—But no, Maurice! I rather honour thee for thy virtuous constancy. There are things most necessary to be done, theperpetrator of which we neither love nor honour; and there may be refusals to serve us, which shall rather exalt in our estimation thosewho deny our request. The arrest of my unfortunate brother forms no such good title to the high ofﬁce of Chancellor, as thy chivalrousand courageous denial establishes in thee to the truncheon of High Marshal. Think of this, De Bracy, and begone to thy charge.”“Fickle tyrant!” muttered De Bracy, as he left the presence of the Prince; “evil luck have they who trust thee. Thy Chancellor,indeed!—He who hath the keeping of thy conscience shall have an easy charge, I trow. But High Marshal of England! that,” he said,extending his arm, as if to grasp the baton of ofﬁce, and assuming a loftier stride along the antechamber, “that is indeed a prize worthplaying for!”De Bracy had no sooner left the apartment than Prince John summoned an attendant.“Bid Hugh Bardon, our scout-master, come hither, as soon as he shall have spoken with Waldemar Fitzurse.”The scout-master arrived after a brief delay, during which John traversed the apartment with, unequal and disordered steps.“Bardon,” said he, “what did Waldemar desire of thee?”“Two resolute men, well acquainted with these northern wilds, and skilful in tracking the tread of man and horse.”“And thou hast ﬁtted him?”“Let your grace never trust me else,” answered the master of the spies. “One is from Hexamshire; he is wont to trace the Tynedaleand Teviotdale thieves, as a bloodhound follows the slot of a hurt deer. The other is Yorkshire bred, and has twanged his bowstringright oft in merry Sherwood; he knows each glade and dingle, copse and high-wood, betwixt this and Richmond.”“’Tis well,” said the Prince.—“Goes Waldemar forth with them?”“Instantly,” said Bardon.“With what attendance?” asked John, carelessly.“Broad Thoresby goes with him, and Wetheral, whom they call, for his cruelty, Stephen Steel-heart; and three northern men-at-armsthat belonged to Ralph Middleton’s gang—they are called the Spears of Spyinghow.”“’Tis well,” said Prince John; then added, after a moment’s pause, “Bardon, it imports our service that thou keep a strict watch onMaurice De Bracy—so that he shall not observe it, however—And let us know of his motions from time to time—with whom heconverses, what he proposeth. Fail not in this, as thou wilt be answerable.”Hugh Bardon bowed, and retired.“If Maurice betrays me,” said Prince John—“if he betrays me, as his bearing leads me to fear, I will have his head, were Richardthundering at the gates of York.”CHAPTER XXXVArouse the tiger of Hyrcanian deserts,Strive with the half-starved lion for his prey;Lesser the risk, than rouse the slumbering ﬁreOf wild Fanaticism.ANONYMUSANONYMUSOur tale now returns to Isaac of York.—Mounted upon a mule, the gift of the Outlaw, with two tall yeomen to act as his guard andguides, the Jew had set out for the Preceptory of Templestowe, for the purpose of negotiating his daughter’s redemption. ThePreceptory was but a day’s journey from the demolished castle of Torquilstone, and the Jew had hoped to reach it before nightfall;accordingly, having dismissed his guides at the verge of the forest, and rewarded them with a piece of silver, he began to press on withsuch speed as his weariness permitted him to exert. But his strength failed him totally ere he had reached within four miles of theTemple-Court; racking pains shot along his back and through his limbs, and the excessive anguish which he felt at heart being nowaugmented by bodily suffering, he was rendered altogether incapable of proceeding farther than a small market-town, were dwelt aJewish Rabbi of his tribe, eminent in the medical profession, and to whom Isaac was well known. Nathan Ben Israel received hissuffering countryman with that kindness which the law prescribed, and which the Jews practised to each other. He insisted on hisbetaking himself to repose, and used such remedies as were then in most repute to check the progress of the fever, which terror,fatigue, ill usage, and sorrow, had brought upon the poor old Jew.On the morrow, when Isaac proposed to arise and pursue his journey, Nathan remonstrated against his purpose, both as his host andas his physician. It might cost him, he said, his life. But Isaac replied, that more than life and death depended upon his going thatmorning to Templestowe.“To Templestowe!” said his host with surprise again felt his pulse, and then muttered to himself, “His fever is abated, yet seems hismind somewhat alienated and disturbed.”“And why not to Templestowe?” answered his patient. “I grant thee, Nathan, that it is a dwelling of those to whom the despisedChildren of the Promise are a stumbling-block and an abomination; yet thou knowest that pressing affairs of trafﬁc sometimes carry usamong these bloodthirsty Nazarene soldiers, and that we visit the Preceptories of the Templars, as well as the Commanderies of theKnights Hospitallers, as they are called.” 48“I know it well,” said Nathan; “but wottest thou that Lucas de Beaumanoir, the chief of their Order, and whom they term GrandMaster, is now himself at Templestowe?”“I know it not,” said Isaac; “our last letters from our brethren at Paris advised us that he was at that city, beseeching Philip for aidagainst the Sultan Saladine.”“He hath since come to England, unexpected by his brethren,” said Ben Israel; “and he cometh among them with a strong andoutstretched arm to correct and to punish. His countenance is kindled in anger against those who have departed from the vow whichthey have made, and great is the fear of those sons of Belial. Thou must have heard of his name?”“It is well known unto me,” said Isaac; “the Gentiles deliver this Lucas Beaumanoir as a man zealous to slaying for every point ofthe Nazarene law; and our brethren have termed him a ﬁerce destroyer of the Saracens, and a cruel tyrant to the Children of thePromise.”“And truly have they termed him,” said Nathan the physician. “Other Templars may be moved from the purpose of their heart bypleasure, or bribed by promise of gold and silver; but Beaumanoir is of a different stamp—hating sensuality, despising treasure, andpressing forward to that which they call the crown of martyrdom—The God of Jacob speedily send it unto him, and unto them all!Specially hath this proud man extended his glove over the children of Judah, as holy David over Edom, holding the murder of a Jew tobe an offering of as sweet savour as the death of a Saracen. Impious and false things has he said even of the virtues of our medicines,as if they were the devices of Satan—The Lord rebuke him!”“Nevertheless,” said Isaac, “I must present myself at Templestowe, though he hath made his face like unto a ﬁery furnace seventimes heated.”He then explained to Nathan the pressing cause of his journey. The Rabbi listened with interest, and testiﬁed his sympathy after thefashion of his people, rending his clothes, and saying, “Ah, my daughter!—ah, my daughter!—Alas! for the beauty of Zion!—Alas!for the captivity of Israel!”“Thou seest,” said Isaac, “how it stands with me, and that I may not tarry. Peradventure, the presence of this Lucas Beaumanoir,being the chief man over them, may turn Brian de Bois-Guilbert from the ill which he doth meditate, and that he may deliver to me mybeloved daughter Rebecca.”“Go thou,” said Nathan Ben Israel, “and be wise, for wisdom availed Daniel in the den of lions into which he was cast; and may itgo well with thee, even as thine heart wisheth. Yet, if thou canst, keep thee from the presence of the Grand Master, for to do foul scornto our people is his morning and evening delight. It may be if thou couldst speak with Bois-Guilbert in private, thou shalt the betterprevail with him; for men say that these accursed Nazarenes are not of one mind in the Preceptory—May their counsels beconfounded and brought to shame! But do thou, brother, return to me as if it were to the house of thy father, and bring me word how ithas sped with thee; and well do I hope thou wilt bring with thee Rebecca, even the scholar of the wise Miriam, whose cures theGentiles slandered as if they had been wrought by necromancy.”Isaac accordingly bade his friend farewell, and about an hour’s riding brought him before the Preceptory of Templestowe.This establishment of the Templars was seated amidst fair meadows and pastures, which the devotion of the former Preceptor hadbestowed upon their Order. It was strong and well fortiﬁed, a point never neglected by these knights, and which the disordered state ofEngland rendered peculiarly necessary. Two halberdiers, clad in black, guarded the drawbridge, and others, in the same sad livery,glided to and fro upon the walls with a funereal pace, resembling spectres more than soldiers. The inferior ofﬁcers of the Order werethus dressed, ever since their use of white garments, similar to those of the knights and esquires, had given rise to a combination ofcertain false brethren in the mountains of Palestine, terming themselves Templars, and bringing great dishonour on the Order. A knightwas now and then seen to cross the court in his long white cloak, his head depressed on his breast, and his arms folded. They passedeach other, if they chanced to meet, with a slow, solemn, and mute greeting; for such was the rule of their Order, quoting thereupon theholy texts, “In many words thou shalt not avoid sin,” and “Life and death are in the power of the tongue.” In a word, the stern asceticrigour of the Temple discipline, which had been so long exchanged for prodigal and licentious indulgence, seemed at once to haverevived at Templestowe under the severe eye of Lucas Beaumanoir.Isaac paused at the gate, to consider how he might seek entrance in the manner most likely to bespeak favour; for he was wellaware, that to his unhappy race the reviving fanaticism of the Order was not less dangerous than their unprincipled licentiousness; andthat his religion would be the object of hate and persecution in the one case, as his wealth would have exposed him in the other to theextortions of unrelenting oppression.Meantime Lucas Beaumanoir walked in a small garden belonging to the Preceptory, included within the precincts of its exteriorfortiﬁcation, and held sad and conﬁdential communication with a brother of his Order, who had come in his company from Palestine.The Grand Master was a man advanced in age, as was testiﬁed by his long grey beard, and the shaggy grey eyebrows overhangingeyes, of which, however, years had been unable to quench the ﬁre. A formidable warrior, his thin and severe features retained thesoldier’s ﬁerceness of expression; an ascetic bigot, they were no less marked by the emaciation of abstinence, and the spiritual pride ofthe self-satisﬁed devotee. Yet with these severer traits of physiognomy, there was mixed somewhat striking and noble, arising,doubtless, from the great part which his high ofﬁce called upon him to act among monarchs and princes, and from the habitualexercise of supreme authority over the valiant and high-born knights, who were united by the rules of the Order. His stature was tall,and his gait, undepressed by age and toil, was erect and stately. His white mantle was shaped with severe regularity, according to therule of Saint Bernard himself, being composed of what was then called Burrel cloth, exactly ﬁtted to the size of the wearer, andbearing on the left shoulder the octangular cross peculiar to the Order, formed of red cloth. No vair or ermine decked this garment; butin respect of his age, the Grand Master, as permitted by the rules, wore his doublet lined and trimmed with the softest lambskin,dressed with the wool outwards, which was the nearest approach he could regularly make to the use of fur, then the greatest luxury ofdress. In his hand he bore that singular “abacus”, or staff of ofﬁce, with which Templars are usually represented, having at the upperend a round plate, on which was engraved the cross of the Order, inscribed within a circle or orle, as heralds term it. His companion,who attended on this great personage, had nearly the same dress in all respects, but his extreme deference towards his Superiorshowed that no other equality subsisted between them. The Preceptor, for such he was in rank, walked not in a line with the GrandMaster, but just so far behind that Beaumanoir could speak to him without turning round his head.“Conrade,” said the Grand Master, “dear companion of my battles and my toils, to thy faithful bosom alone I can conﬁde mysorrows. To thee alone can I tell how oft, since I came to this kingdom, I have desired to be dissolved and to be with the just. Not oneobject in England hath met mine eye which it could rest upon with pleasure, save the tombs of our brethren, beneath the massive roofof our Temple Church in yonder proud capital. O, valiant Robert de Ros! did I exclaim internally, as I gazed upon these good soldiersof the cross, where they lie sculptured on their sepulchres,—O, worthy William de Mareschal! open your marble cells, and take toyour repose a weary brother, who would rather strive with a hundred thousand pagans than witness the decay of our Holy Order!”“It is but true,” answered Conrade Mont-Fitchet; “it is but too true; and the irregularities of our brethren in England are even moregross than those in France.”“Because they are more wealthy,” answered the Grand Master. “Bear with me, brother, although I should something vaunt myself.Thou knowest the life I have led, keeping each point of my Order, striving with devils embodied and disembodied, striking down theroaring lion, who goeth about seeking whom he may devour, like a good knight and devout priest, wheresoever I met with him—evenas blessed Saint Bernard hath prescribed to us in the forty-ﬁfth capital of our rule, ‘Ut Leo semper feriatur’. 49“But by the Holy Temple! the zeal which hath devoured my substance and my life, yea, the very nerves and marrow of my bones;by that very Holy Temple I swear to thee, that save thyself and some few that still retain the ancient severity of our Order, I look uponno brethren whom I can bring my soul to embrace under that holy name. What say our statutes, and how do our brethren observethem? They should wear no vain or worldly ornament, no crest upon their helmet, no gold upon stirrup or bridle-bit; yet who now gopranked out so proudly and so gaily as the poor soldiers of the Temple? They are forbidden by our statutes to take one bird by meansof another, to shoot beasts with bow or arblast, to halloo to a hunting-horn, or to spur the horse after game. But now, at hunting andhawking, and each idle sport of wood and river, who so prompt as the Templars in all these fond vanities? They are forbidden to read,save what their Superior permitted, or listen to what is read, save such holy things as may be recited aloud during the hours ofrefaction; but lo! their ears are at the command of idle minstrels, and their eyes study empty romaunts. They were commanded toextirpate magic and heresy. Lo! they are charged with studying the accursed cabalistical secrets of the Jews, and the magic of thePaynim Saracens. Simpleness of diet was prescribed to them, roots, pottage, gruels, eating ﬂesh but thrice a-week, because theaccustomed feeding on ﬂesh is a dishonourable corruption of the body; and behold, their tables groan under delicate fare! Their drinkwas to be water, and now, to drink like a Templar, is the boast of each jolly boon companion! This very garden, ﬁlled as it is withcurious herbs and trees sent from the Eastern climes, better becomes the harem of an unbelieving Emir, than the plot which ChristianMonks should devote to raise their homely pot-herbs.—And O, Conrade! well it were that the relaxation of discipline stopped evenhere!—Well thou knowest that we were forbidden to receive those devout women, who at the beginning were associated as sisters ofour Order, because, saith the forty-sixth chapter, the Ancient Enemy hath, by female society, withdrawn many from the right path toparadise. Nay, in the last capital, being, as it were, the cope-stone which our blessed founder placed on the pure and undeﬁled doctrinewhich he had enjoined, we are prohibited from offering, even to our sisters and our mothers, the kiss of affection—‘ut omniummulierum fugiantur oscula’.—I shame to speak—I shame to think—of the corruptions which have rushed in upon us even like a ﬂood.The souls of our pure founders, the spirits of Hugh de Payen and Godfrey de Saint Omer, and of the blessed Seven who ﬁrst joined indedicating their lives to the service of the Temple, are disturbed even in the enjoyment of paradise itself. I have seen them, Conrade, inthe visions of the night—their sainted eyes shed tears for the sins and follies of their brethren, and for the foul and shameful luxury inwhich they wallow. Beaumanoir, they say, thou slumberest—awake! There is a stain in the fabric of the Temple, deep and foul as thatleft by the streaks of leprosy on the walls of the infected houses of old. 50“The soldiers of the Cross, who should shun the glance of a woman as the eye of a basilisk, live in open sin, not with the females oftheir own race only, but with the daughters of the accursed heathen, and more accursed Jew. Beaumanoir, thou sleepest; up, andavenge our cause!—Slay the sinners, male and female!—Take to thee the brand of Phineas!—The vision ﬂed, Conrade, but as Iawaked I could still hear the clank of their mail, and see the waving of their white mantles.—And I will do according to their word, IWILL purify the fabric of the Temple! and the unclean stones in which the plague is, I will remove and cast out of the building.”“Yet bethink thee, reverend father,” said Mont-Fitchet, “the stain hath become engrained by time and consuetude; let thyreformation be cautious, as it is just and wise.”“No, Mont-Fitchet,” answered the stern old man—“it must be sharp and sudden—the Order is on the crisis of its fate. The sobriety,self-devotion, and piety of our predecessors, made us powerful friends—our presumption, our wealth, our luxury, have raised upagainst us mighty enemies.—We must cast away these riches, which are a temptation to princes—we must lay down that presumption,which is an offence to them—we must reform that license of manners, which is a scandal to the whole Christian world! Or—mark mywords—the Order of the Temple will be utterly demolished—and the Place thereof shall no more be known among the nations.”“Now may God avert such a calamity!” said the Preceptor.“Amen,” said the Grand Master, with solemnity, “but we must deserve his aid. I tell thee, Conrade, that neither the powers inHeaven, nor the powers on earth, will longer endure the wickedness of this generation—My intelligence is sure—the ground on whichour fabric is reared is already undermined, and each addition we make to the structure of our greatness will only sink it the sooner inthe abyss. We must retrace our steps, and show ourselves the faithful Champions of the Cross, sacriﬁcing to our calling, not alone ourblood and our lives—not alone our lusts and our vices—but our ease, our comforts, and our natural affections, and act as menconvinced that many a pleasure which may be lawful to others, is forbidden to the vowed soldier of the Temple.”At this moment a squire, clothed in a threadbare vestment, (for the aspirants after this holy Order wore during their noviciate thecast-off garments of the knights,) entered the garden, and, bowing profoundly before the Grand Master, stood silent, awaiting hispermission ere he presumed to tell his errand.“Is it not more seemly,” said the Grand Master, “to see this Damian, clothed in the garments of Christian humility, thus appear withreverend silence before his Superior, than but two days since, when the fond fool was decked in a painted coat, and jangling as pertand as proud as any popinjay?—Speak, Damian, we permit thee—What is thine errand?”“A Jew stands without the gate, noble and reverend father,” said the Squire, “who prays to speak with brother Brian de Bois-Guilbert.”“Thou wert right to give me knowledge of it,” said the Grand Master; “in our presence a Preceptor is but as a common compeer ofour Order, who may not walk according to his own will, but to that of his Master—even according to the text, ‘In the hearing of theear he hath obeyed me.’—It imports us especially to know of this Bois-Guilbert’s proceedings,” said he, turning to his companion.“Report speaks him brave and valiant,” said Conrade.“And truly is he so spoken of,” said the Grand Master; “in our valour only we are not degenerated from our predecessors, the heroesof the Cross. But brother Brian came into our Order a moody and disappointed man, stirred, I doubt me, to take our vows and torenounce the world, not in sincerity of soul, but as one whom some touch of light discontent had driven into penitence. Since then, hehath become an active and earnest agitator, a murmurer, and a machinator, and a leader amongst those who impugn our authority; notconsidering that the rule is given to the Master even by the symbol of the staff and the rod—the staff to support the inﬁrmities of theweak—the rod to correct the faults of delinquents.—Damian,” he continued, “lead the Jew to our presence.”The squire departed with a profound reverence, and in a few minutes returned, marshalling in Isaac of York. No naked slave,ushered into the presence of some mighty prince, could approach his judgment-seat with more profound reverence and terror than thatwith which the Jew drew near to the presence of the Grand Master. When he had approached within the distance of three yards,Beaumanoir made a sign with his staff that he should come no farther. The Jew kneeled down on the earth which he kissed in token ofreverence; then rising, stood before the Templars, his hands folded on his bosom, his head bowed on his breast, in all the submissionof Oriental slavery.“Damian,” said the Grand Master, “retire, and have a guard ready to await our sudden call; and suffer no one to enter the gardenuntil we shall leave it.”—The squire bowed and retreated.—“Jew,” continued the haughty old man, “mark me. It suits not ourcondition to hold with thee long communication, nor do we waste words or time upon any one. Wherefore be brief in thy answers towhat questions I shall ask thee, and let thy words be of truth; for if thy tongue doubles with me, I will have it torn from thymisbelieving jaws.”The Jew was about to reply, but the Grand Master went on.“Peace, unbeliever!—not a word in our presence, save in answer to our questions.—What is thy business with our brother Brian deBois-Guilbert?”Isaac gasped with terror and uncertainty. To tell his tale might be interpreted into scandalizing the Order; yet, unless he told it, whathope could he have of achieving his daughter’s deliverance? Beaumanoir saw his mortal apprehension, and condescended to give himsome assurance.“Fear nothing,” he said, “for thy wretched person, Jew, so thou dealest uprightly in this matter. I demand again to know from theethy business with Brian de Bois-Guilbert?”“I am bearer of a letter,” stammered out the Jew, “so please your reverend valour, to that good knight, from Prior Aymer of theAbbey of Jorvaulx.”“Said I not these were evil times, Conrade?” said the Master. “A Cistertian Prior sends a letter to a soldier of the Temple, and canﬁnd no more ﬁtting messenger than an unbelieving Jew.—Give me the letter.”The Jew, with trembling hands, undid the folds of his Armenian cap, in which he had deposited the Prior’s tablets for the greatersecurity, and was about to approach, with hand extended and body crouched, to place it within the reach of his grim interrogator.“Back, dog!” said the Grand Master; “I touch not misbelievers, save with the sword.—Conrade, take thou the letter from the Jew,and give it to me.”Beaumanoir, being thus possessed of the tablets, inspected the outside carefully, and then proceeded to undo the packthread whichsecured its folds. “Reverend father,” said Conrade, interposing, though with much deference, “wilt thou break the seal?”“And will I not?” said Beaumanoir, with a frown. “Is it not written in the forty-second capital, ‘De Lectione Literarum’ that aTemplar shall not receive a letter, no not from his father, without communicating the same to the Grand Master, and reading it in hispresence?”He then perused the letter in haste, with an expression of surprise and horror; read it over again more slowly; then holding it out toConrade with one hand, and slightly striking it with the other, exclaimed—“Here is goodly stuff for one Christian man to write toanother, and both members, and no inconsiderable members, of religious professions! When,” said he solemnly, and looking upward,“wilt thou come with thy fanners to purge the thrashing-ﬂoor?”Mont-Fitchet took the letter from his Superior, and was about to peruse it.“Read it aloud, Conrade,” said the Grand Master,—“and do thou” (to Isaac) “attend to the purport of it, for we will question theeconcerning it.”Conrade read the letter, which was in these words: “Aymer, by divine grace, Prior of the Cistertian house of Saint Mary’s ofJorvaulx, to Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert, a Knight of the holy Order of the Temple, wisheth health, with the bounties of King Bacchusand of my Lady Venus. Touching our present condition, dear Brother, we are a captive in the hands of certain lawless and godlessmen, who have not feared to detain our person, and put us to ransom; whereby we have also learned of Front-de-Bœuf’s misfortune,and that thou hast escaped with that fair Jewish sorceress, whose black eyes have bewitched thee. We are heartily rejoiced of thysafety; nevertheless, we pray thee to be on thy guard in the matter of this second Witch of Endor; for we are privately assured that yourGreat Master, who careth not a bean for cherry cheeks and black eyes, comes from Normandy to diminish your mirth, and amend yourmisdoings. Wherefore we pray you heartily to beware, and to be found watching, even as the Holy Text hath it, ‘Invenienturvigilantes’. And the wealthy Jew her father, Isaac of York, having prayed of me letters in his behalf, I gave him these, earnestlyadvising, and in a sort entreating, that you do hold the damsel to ransom, seeing he will pay you from his bags as much as may ﬁndﬁfty damsels upon safer terms, whereof I trust to have my part when we make merry together, as true brothers, not forgetting the wine-cup. For what saith the text, ‘Vinum laetiﬁcat cor hominis’; and again, ‘Rex delectabitur pulchritudine tua’.“Till which merry meeting, we wish you farewell. Given from this den of thieves, about the hour of matins,“Aymer Pr. S. M. Jorvolciencis.“‘Postscriptum.’ Truly your golden chain hath not long abidden with me, and will now sustain, around the neck of an outlaw deer-stealer, the whistle wherewith he calleth on his hounds.”“What sayest thou to this, Conrade?” said the Grand Master—“Den of thieves! and a ﬁt residence is a den of thieves for such aPrior. No wonder that the hand of God is upon us, and that in the Holy Land we lose place by place, foot by foot, before the inﬁdels,when we have such churchmen as this Aymer.—And what meaneth he, I trow, by this second Witch of Endor?” said he to hisconﬁdent, something apart. Conrade was better acquainted (perhaps by practice) with the jargon of gallantry, than was his Superior;and he expounded the passage which embarrassed the Grand Master, to be a sort of language used by worldly men towards thosewhom they loved ‘par amours’; but the explanation did not satisfy the bigoted Beaumanoir.“There is more in it than thou dost guess, Conrade; thy simplicity is no match for this deep abyss of wickedness. This Rebecca ofYork was a pupil of that Miriam of whom thou hast heard. Thou shalt hear the Jew own it even now.” Then turning to Isaac, he saidaloud, “Thy daughter, then, is prisoner with Brian de Bois-Guilbert?”“Ay, reverend valorous sir,” stammered poor Isaac, “and whatsoever ransom a poor man may pay for her deliverance—-”“Peace!” said the Grand Master. “This thy daughter hath practised the art of healing, hath she not?”“Ay, gracious sir,” answered the Jew, with more conﬁdence; “and knight and yeoman, squire and vassal, may bless the goodly giftwhich Heaven hath assigned to her. Many a one can testify that she hath recovered them by her art, when every other human aid hathproved vain; but the blessing of the God of Jacob was upon her.”Beaumanoir turned to Mont-Fitchet with a grim smile. “See, brother,” he said, “the deceptions of the devouring Enemy! Behold thebaits with which he ﬁshes for souls, giving a poor space of earthly life in exchange for eternal happiness hereafter. Well said ourblessed rule, ‘Semper percutiatur leo vorans’.—Up on the lion! Down with the destroyer!” said he, shaking aloft his mystic abacus, asif in deﬁance of the powers of darkness—“Thy daughter worketh the cures, I doubt not,” thus he went on to address the Jew, “bywords and sighs, and periapts, and other cabalistical mysteries.”“Nay, reverend and brave Knight,” answered Isaac, “but in chief measure by a balsam of marvellous virtue.”“Where had she that secret?” said Beaumanoir.“It was delivered to her,” answered Isaac, reluctantly, “by Miriam, a sage matron of our tribe.”“Ah, false Jew!” said the Grand Master; “was it not from that same witch Miriam, the abomination of whose enchantments havebeen heard of throughout every Christian land?” exclaimed the Grand Master, crossing himself. “Her body was burnt at a stake, andher ashes were scattered to the four winds; and so be it with me and mine Order, if I do not as much to her pupil, and more also! I willteach her to throw spell and incantation over the soldiers of the blessed Temple.—There, Damian, spurn this Jew from the gate—shoothim dead if he oppose or turn again. With his daughter we will deal as the Christian law and our own high ofﬁce warrant.”Poor Isaac was hurried off accordingly, and expelled from the preceptory; all his entreaties, and even his offers, unheard anddisregarded. He could do not better than return to the house of the Rabbi, and endeavour, through his means, to learn how his daughterwas to be disposed of. He had hitherto feared for her honour, he was now to tremble for her life. Meanwhile, the Grand Master orderedto his presence the Preceptor of Templestowe.CHAPTER XXXVISay not my art is fraud—all live by seeming.The beggar begs with it, and the gay courtierGains land and title, rank and rule, by seeming;The clergy scorn it not, and the bold soldierWill eke with it his service.—All admit it,All practise it; and he who is contentWith showing what he is, shall have small creditIn church, or camp, or state—So wags the world.OLD PLAYAlbert Malvoisin, President, or, in the language of the Order, Preceptor of the establishment of Templestowe, was brother to thatPhilip Malvoisin who has been already occasionally mentioned in this history, and was, like that baron, in close league with Brian deBois-Guilbert.Amongst dissolute and unprincipled men, of whom the Temple Order included but too many, Albert of Templestowe might bedistinguished; but with this difference from the audacious Bois-Guilbert, that he knew how to throw over his vices and his ambitionthe veil of hypocrisy, and to assume in his exterior the fanaticism which he internally despised. Had not the arrival of the GrandMaster been so unexpectedly sudden, he would have seen nothing at Templestowe which might have appeared to argue any relaxationof discipline. And, even although surprised, and, to a certain extent, detected, Albert Malvoisin listened with such respect and apparentcontrition to the rebuke of his Superior, and made such haste to reform the particulars he censured,—succeeded, in ﬁne, so well ingiving an air of ascetic devotion to a family which had been lately devoted to license and pleasure, that Lucas Beaumanoir began toentertain a higher opinion of the Preceptor’s morals, than the ﬁrst appearance of the establishment had inclined him to adopt.But these favourable sentiments on the part of the Grand Master were greatly shaken by the intelligence that Albert had receivedwithin a house of religion the Jewish captive, and, as was to be feared, the paramour of a brother of the Order; and when Albertappeared before him, he was regarded with unwonted sternness.“There is in this mansion, dedicated to the purposes of the holy Order of the Temple,” said the Grand Master, in a severe tone, “aJewish woman, brought hither by a brother of religion, by your connivance, Sir Preceptor.”Albert Malvoisin was overwhelmed with confusion; for the unfortunate Rebecca had been conﬁned in a remote and secret part ofthe building, and every precaution used to prevent her residence there from being known. He read in the looks of Beaumanoir ruin toBois-Guilbert and to himself, unless he should be able to avert the impending storm.“Why are you mute?” continued the Grand Master.“Is it permitted to me to reply?” answered the Preceptor, in a tone of the deepest humility, although by the question he only meant togain an instant’s space for arranging his ideas.“Speak, you are permitted,” said the Grand Master—“speak, and say, knowest thou the capital of our holy rule,—‘Decommilitonibus Templi in sancta civitate, qui cum miserrimis mulieribus versantur, propter oblectationem carnis?’” 51“Surely, most reverend father,” answered the Preceptor, “I have not risen to this ofﬁce in the Order, being ignorant of one of its mostimportant prohibitions.”“How comes it, then, I demand of thee once more, that thou hast suffered a brother to bring a paramour, and that paramour a Jewishsorceress, into this holy place, to the stain and pollution thereof?”“A Jewish sorceress!” echoed Albert Malvoisin; “good angels guard us!”“Ay, brother, a Jewish sorceress!” said the Grand Master, sternly. “I have said it. Darest thou deny that this Rebecca, the daughter ofthat wretched usurer Isaac of York, and the pupil of the foul witch Miriam, is now—shame to be thought or spoken!—lodged withinthis thy Preceptory?”“Your wisdom, reverend father,” answered the Preceptor, “hath rolled away the darkness from my understanding. Much did Iwonder that so good a knight as Brian de Bois-Guilbert seemed so fondly besotted on the charms of this female, whom I received intothis house merely to place a bar betwixt their growing intimacy, which else might have been cemented at the expense of the fall of ourvaliant and religious brother.”“Hath nothing, then, as yet passed betwixt them in breach of his vow?” demanded the Grand Master.“What! under this roof?” said the Preceptor, crossing himself; “Saint Magdalene and the ten thousand virgins forbid!—No! if I havesinned in receiving her here, it was in the erring thought that I might thus break off our brother’s besotted devotion to this Jewess,which seemed to me so wild and unnatural, that I could not but ascribe it to some touch of insanity, more to be cured by pity thanreproof. But since your reverend wisdom hath discovered this Jewish queen to be a sorceress, perchance it may account fully for hisenamoured folly.”“It doth!—it doth!” said Beaumanoir. “See, brother Conrade, the peril of yielding to the ﬁrst devices and blandishments of Satan!We look upon woman only to gratify the lust of the eye, and to take pleasure in what men call her beauty; and the Ancient Enemy, thedevouring Lion, obtains power over us, to complete, by talisman and spell, a work which was begun by idleness and folly. It may bethat our brother Bois-Guilbert does in this matter deserve rather pity than severe chastisement; rather the support of the staff, than thestrokes of the rod; and that our admonitions and prayers may turn him from his folly, and restore him to his brethren.”“It were deep pity,” said Conrade Mont-Fitchet, “to lose to the Order one of its best lances, when the Holy Community mostrequires the aid of its sons. Three hundred Saracens hath this Brian de Bois-Guilbert slain with his own hand.”“The blood of these accursed dogs,” said the Grand Master, “shall be a sweet and acceptable offering to the saints and angels whomthey despise and blaspheme; and with their aid will we counteract the spells and charms with which our brother is entwined as in a net.He shall burst the bands of this Delilah, as Sampson burst the two new cords with which the Philistines had bound him, and shallslaughter the inﬁdels, even heaps upon heaps. But concerning this foul witch, who hath ﬂung her enchantments over a brother of theHoly Temple, assuredly she shall die the death.”“But the laws of England,”—said the Preceptor, who, though delighted that the Grand Master’s resentment, thus fortunately avertedfrom himself and Bois-Guilbert, had taken another direction, began now to fear he was carrying it too far.“The laws of England,” interrupted Beaumanoir, “permit and enjoin each judge to execute justice within his own jurisdiction. Themost petty baron may arrest, try, and condemn a witch found within his own domain. And shall that power be denied to the GrandMaster of the Temple within a preceptory of his Order?—No!—we will judge and condemn. The witch shall be taken out of the land,and the wickedness thereof shall be forgiven. Prepare the Castle-hall for the trial of the sorceress.”Albert Malvoisin bowed and retired,—not to give directions for preparing the hall, but to seek out Brian de Bois-Guilbert, andcommunicate to him how matters were likely to terminate. It was not long ere he found him, foaming with indignation at a repulse hehad anew sustained from the fair Jewess. “The unthinking,” he said, “the ungrateful, to scorn him who, amidst blood and ﬂames,would have saved her life at the risk of his own! By Heaven, Malvoisin! I abode until roof and rafters crackled and crashed around me.I was the butt of a hundred arrows; they rattled on mine armour like hailstones against a latticed casement, and the only use I made ofmy shield was for her protection. This did I endure for her; and now the self-willed girl upbraids me that I did not leave her to perish,and refuses me not only the slightest proof of gratitude, but even the most distant hope that ever she will be brought to grant any. Thedevil, that possessed her race with obstinacy, has concentrated its full force in her single person!”“The devil,” said the Preceptor, “I think, possessed you both. How oft have I preached to you caution, if not continence? Did I nottell you that there were enough willing Christian damsels to be met with, who would think it sin to refuse so brave a knight ‘le dond’amoureux merci’, and you must needs anchor your affection on a wilful, obstinate Jewess! By the mass, I think old LucasBeaumanoir guesses right, when he maintains she hath cast a spell over you.”“Lucas Beaumanoir!”—said Bois-Guilbert reproachfully—“Are these your precautions, Malvoisin? Hast thou suffered the dotard tolearn that Rebecca is in the Preceptory?”“How could I help it?” said the Preceptor. “I neglected nothing that could keep secret your mystery; but it is betrayed, and whetherby the devil or no, the devil only can tell. But I have turned the matter as I could; you are safe if you renounce Rebecca. You are pitied—the victim of magical delusion. She is a sorceress, and must suffer as such.”“She shall not, by Heaven!” said Bois-Guilbert.“By Heaven, she must and will!” said Malvoisin. “Neither you nor any one else can save her. Lucas Beaumanoir hath settled thatthe death of a Jewess will be a sin-offering sufﬁcient to atone for all the amorous indulgences of the Knights Templars; and thouknowest he hath both the power and will to execute so reasonable and pious a purpose.”“Will future ages believe that such stupid bigotry ever existed!” said Bois-Guilbert, striding up and down the apartment.“What they may believe, I know not,” said Malvoisin, calmly; “but I know well, that in this our day, clergy and laymen, take ninety-nine to the hundred, will cry ‘amen’ to the Grand Master’s sentence.”“I have it,” said Bois-Guilbert. “Albert, thou art my friend. Thou must connive at her escape, Malvoisin, and I will transport her tosome place of greater security and secrecy.”“I cannot, if I would,” replied the Preceptor; “the mansion is ﬁlled with the attendants of the Grand Master, and others who aredevoted to him. And, to be frank with you, brother, I would not embark with you in this matter, even if I could hope to bring my barkto haven. I have risked enough already for your sake. I have no mind to encounter a sentence of degradation, or even to lose myPreceptory, for the sake of a painted piece of Jewish ﬂesh and blood. And you, if you will be guided by my counsel, will give up thiswild-goose chase, and ﬂy your hawk at some other game. Think, Bois-Guilbert,—thy present rank, thy future honours, all depend onthy place in the Order. Shouldst thou adhere perversely to thy passion for this Rebecca, thou wilt give Beaumanoir the power ofexpelling thee, and he will not neglect it. He is jealous of the truncheon which he holds in his trembling gripe, and he knows thoustretchest thy bold hand towards it. Doubt not he will ruin thee, if thou affordest him a pretext so fair as thy protection of a Jewishsorceress. Give him his scope in this matter, for thou canst not control him. When the staff is in thine own ﬁrm grasp, thou mayestcaress the daughters of Judah, or burn them, as may best suit thine own humour.”“Malvoisin,” said Bois-Guilbert, “thou art a cold-blooded—”“Friend,” said the Preceptor, hastening to ﬁll up the blank, in which Bois-Guilbert would probably have placed a worse word,—“acold-blooded friend I am, and therefore more ﬁt to give thee advice. I tell thee once more, that thou canst not save Rebecca. I tell theeonce more, thou canst but perish with her. Go hie thee to the Grand Master—throw thyself at his feet and tell him—”“Not at his feet, by Heaven! but to the dotard’s very beard will I say—”“Say to him, then, to his beard,” continued Malvoisin, coolly, “that you love this captive Jewess to distraction; and the more thoudost enlarge on thy passion, the greater will be his haste to end it by the death of the fair enchantress; while thou, taken in ﬂagrantdelict by the avowal of a crime contrary to thine oath, canst hope no aid of thy brethren, and must exchange all thy brilliant visions ofambition and power, to lift perhaps a mercenary spear in some of the petty quarrels between Flanders and Burgundy.”“Thou speakest the truth, Malvoisin,” said Brian de Bois-Guilbert, after a moment’s reﬂection. “I will give the hoary bigot noadvantage over me; and for Rebecca, she hath not merited at my hand that I should expose rank and honour for her sake. I will cast heroff—yes, I will leave her to her fate, unless—”“Qualify not thy wise and necessary resolution,” said Malvoisin; “women are but the toys which amuse our lighter hours—ambitionis the serious business of life. Perish a thousand such frail baubles as this Jewess, before thy manly step pause in the brilliant careerthat lies stretched before thee! For the present we part, nor must we be seen to hold close conversation—I must order the hall for hisjudgment-seat.”“What!” said Bois-Guilbert, “so soon?”“Ay,” replied the Preceptor, “trial moves rapidly on when the judge has determined the sentence beforehand.”“Rebecca,” said Bois-Guilbert, when he was left alone, “thou art like to cost me dear—Why cannot I abandon thee to thy fate, asthis calm hypocrite recommends?—One effort will I make to save thee—but beware of ingratitude! for if I am again repulsed, myvengeance shall equal my love. The life and honour of Bois-Guilbert must not be hazarded, where contempt and reproaches are hisonly reward.”The Preceptor had hardly given the necessary orders, when he was joined by Conrade Mont-Fitchet, who acquainted him with theGrand Master’s resolution to bring the Jewess to instant trial for sorcery.“It is surely a dream,” said the Preceptor; “we have many Jewish physicians, and we call them not wizards though they workwonderful cures.”“The Grand Master thinks otherwise,” said Mont-Fitchet; “and, Albert, I will be upright with thee—wizard or not, it were better thatthis miserable damsel die, than that Brian de Bois-Guilbert should be lost to the Order, or the Order divided by internal dissension.Thou knowest his high rank, his fame in arms—thou knowest the zeal with which many of our brethren regard him—but all this willnot avail him with our Grand Master, should he consider Brian as the accomplice, not the victim, of this Jewess. Were the souls of thetwelve tribes in her single body, it were better she suffered alone, than that Bois-Guilbert were partner in her destruction.”“I have been working him even now to abandon her,” said Malvoisin; “but still, are there grounds enough to condemn this Rebeccafor sorcery?—Will not the Grand Master change his mind when he sees that the proofs are so weak?”“They must be strengthened, Albert,” replied Mont-Fitchet, “they must be strengthened. Dost thou understand me?”“I do,” said the Preceptor, “nor do I scruple to do aught for advancement of the Order—but there is little time to ﬁnd enginesﬁtting.”“Malvoisin, they MUST be found,” said Conrade; “well will it advantage both the Order and thee. This Templestowe is a poorPreceptory—that of Maison-Dieu is worth double its value—thou knowest my interest with our old Chief—ﬁnd those who can carrythis matter through, and thou art Preceptor of Maison-Dieu in the fertile Kent—How sayst thou?”“There is,” replied Malvoisin, “among those who came hither with Bois-Guilbert, two fellows whom I well know; servants theywere to my brother Philip de Malvoisin, and passed from his service to that of Front-de-Bœuf—It may be they know something of thewitcheries of this woman.”“Away, seek them out instantly—and hark thee, if a byzant or two will sharpen their memory, let them not be wanting.”“They would swear the mother that bore them a sorceress for a zecchin,” said the Preceptor.“Away, then,” said Mont-Fitchet; “at noon the affair will proceed. I have not seen our senior in such earnest preparation since hecondemned to the stake Hamet Alfagi, a convert who relapsed to the Moslem faith.”The ponderous castle-bell had tolled the point of noon, when Rebecca heard a trampling of feet upon the private stair which led toher place of conﬁnement. The noise announced the arrival of several persons, and the circumstance rather gave her joy; for she wasmore afraid of the solitary visits of the ﬁerce and passionate Bois-Guilbert than of any evil that could befall her besides. The door ofthe chamber was unlocked, and Conrade and the Preceptor Malvoisin entered, attended by four warders clothed in black, and bearinghalberds.“Daughter of an accursed race!” said the Preceptor, “arise and follow us.”“Whither,” said Rebecca, “and for what purpose?”“Damsel,” answered Conrade, “it is not for thee to question, but to obey. Nevertheless, be it known to thee, that thou art to bebrought before the tribunal of the Grand Master of our holy Order, there to answer for thine offences.”“May the God of Abraham be praised!” said Rebecca, folding her hands devoutly; “the name of a judge, though an enemy to mypeople, is to me as the name of a protector. Most willingly do I follow thee—permit me only to wrap my veil around my head.”They descended the stair with slow and solemn step, traversed a long gallery, and, by a pair of folding doors placed at the end,entered the great hall in which the Grand Master had for the time established his court of justice.The lower part of this ample apartment was ﬁlled with squires and yeomen, who made way not without some difﬁculty for Rebecca,attended by the Preceptor and Mont-Fitchet, and followed by the guard of halberdiers, to move forward to the seat appointed for her.As she passed through the crowd, her arms folded and her head depressed, a scrap of paper was thrust into her hand, which shereceived almost unconsciously, and continued to hold without examining its contents. The assurance that she possessed some friend inthis awful assembly gave her courage to look around, and to mark into whose presence she had been conducted. She gazed,accordingly, upon the scene, which we shall endeavour to describe in the next chapter.CHAPTER XXXVIIStern was the law which bade its vot’ries leaveAt human woes with human hearts to grieve;Stern was the law, which at the winning wileOf frank and harmless mirth forbade to smile;But sterner still, when high the iron-rodOf tyrant power she shook, and call’d that power of God.THE MIDDLE AGESThe Tribunal, erected for the trial of the innocent and unhappy Rebecca, occupied the dais or elevated part of the upper end of thegreat hall—a platform, which we have already described as the place of honour, destined to be occupied by the most distinguishedinhabitants or guests of an ancient mansion.On an elevated seat, directly before the accused, sat the Grand Master of the Temple, in full and ample robes of ﬂowing white,holding in his hand the mystic staff, which bore the symbol of the Order. At his feet was placed a table, occupied by two scribes,chaplains of the Order, whose duty it was to reduce to formal record the proceedings of the day. The black dresses, bare scalps, anddemure looks of these church-men, formed a strong contrast to the warlike appearance of the knights who attended, either as residingin the Preceptory, or as come thither to attend upon their Grand Master. The Preceptors, of whom there were four present, occupiedseats lower in height, and somewhat drawn back behind that of their superior; and the knights, who enjoyed no such rank in the Order,were placed on benches still lower, and preserving the same distance from the Preceptors as these from the Grand Master. Behindthem, but still upon the dais or elevated portion of the hall, stood the esquires of the Order, in white dresses of an inferior quality.The whole assembly wore an aspect of the most profound gravity; and in the faces of the knights might be perceived traces ofmilitary daring, united with the solemn carriage becoming men of a religious profession, and which, in the presence of their GrandMaster, failed not to sit upon every brow.The remaining and lower part of the hall was ﬁlled with guards, holding partisans, and with other attendants whom curiosity haddrawn thither, to see at once a Grand Master and a Jewish sorceress. By far the greater part of those inferior persons were, in one rankor other, connected with the Order, and were accordingly distinguished by their black dresses. But peasants from the neighbouringcountry were not refused admittance; for it was the pride of Beaumanoir to render the edifying spectacle of the justice which headministered as public as possible. His large blue eyes seemed to expand as he gazed around the assembly, and his countenanceappeared elated by the conscious dignity, and imaginary merit, of the part which he was about to perform. A psalm, which he himselfaccompanied with a deep mellow voice, which age had not deprived of its powers, commenced the proceedings of the day; and thesolemn sounds, “Venite exultemus Domino”, so often sung by the Templars before engaging with earthly adversaries, was judged byLucas most appropriate to introduce the approaching triumph, for such he deemed it, over the powers of darkness. The deep prolongednotes, raised by a hundred masculine voices accustomed to combine in the choral chant, arose to the vaulted roof of the hall, and rolledon amongst its arches with the pleasing yet solemn sound of the rushing of mighty waters.When the sounds ceased, the Grand Master glanced his eye slowly around the circle, and observed that the seat of one of thePreceptors was vacant. Brian de Bois-Guilbert, by whom it had been occupied, had left his place, and was now standing near theextreme corner of one of the benches occupied by the Knights Companions of the Temple, one hand extending his long mantle, so asin some degree to hide his face; while the other held his cross-handled sword, with the point of which, sheathed as it was, he wasslowly drawing lines upon the oaken ﬂoor.“Unhappy man!” said the Grand Master, after favouring him with a glance of compassion. “Thou seest, Conrade, how this holywork distresses him. To this can the light look of woman, aided by the Prince of the Powers of this world, bring a valiant and worthyknight!—Seest thou he cannot look upon us; he cannot look upon her; and who knows by what impulse from his tormentor his handforms these cabalistic lines upon the ﬂoor?—It may be our life and safety are thus aimed at; but we spit at and defy the foul enemy.‘Semper Leo percutiatur!’”This was communicated apart to his conﬁdential follower, Conrade Mont-Fitchet. The Grand Master then raised his voice, andaddressed the assembly.“Reverend and valiant men, Knights, Preceptors, and Companions of this Holy Order, my brethren and my children!—you also,well-born and pious Esquires, who aspire to wear this holy Cross!—and you also, Christian brethren, of every degree!—Be it knownto you, that it is not defect of power in us which hath occasioned the assembling of this congregation; for, however unworthy in ourperson, yet to us is committed, with this batoon, full power to judge and to try all that regards the weal of this our Holy Order. HolySaint Bernard, in the rule of our knightly and religious profession, hath said, in the ﬁfty-ninth capital, 53 that he would not thatbrethren be called together in council, save at the will and command of the Master; leaving it free to us, as to those more worthyfathers who have preceded us in this our ofﬁce, to judge, as well of the occasion as of the time and place in which a chapter of thewhole Order, or of any part thereof, may be convoked. Also, in all such chapters, it is our duty to hear the advice of our brethren, andto proceed according to our own pleasure. But when the raging wolf hath made an inroad upon the ﬂock, and carried off one memberthereof, it is the duty of the kind shepherd to call his comrades together, that with bows and slings they may quell the invader,according to our well-known rule, that the lion is ever to be beaten down. We have therefore summoned to our presence a Jewishwoman, by name Rebecca, daughter of Isaac of York—a woman infamous for sortileges and for witcheries; whereby she hathmaddened the blood, and besotted the brain, not of a churl, but of a Knight—not of a secular Knight, but of one devoted to the serviceof the Holy Temple—not of a Knight Companion, but of a Preceptor of our Order, ﬁrst in honour as in place. Our brother, Brian deBois-Guilbert, is well known to ourselves, and to all degrees who now hear me, as a true and zealous champion of the Cross, by whosearm many deeds of valour have been wrought in the Holy Land, and the holy places puriﬁed from pollution by the blood of thoseinﬁdels who deﬁled them. Neither have our brother’s sagacity and prudence been less in repute among his brethren than his valour anddiscipline; in so much, that knights, both in eastern and western lands, have named De Bois-Guilbert as one who may well be put innomination as successor to this batoon, when it shall please Heaven to release us from the toil of bearing it. If we were told that such aman, so honoured, and so honourable, suddenly casting away regard for his character, his vows, his brethren, and his prospects, hadassociated to himself a Jewish damsel, wandered in this lewd company, through solitary places, defended her person in preference tohis own, and, ﬁnally, was so utterly blinded and besotted by his folly, as to bring her even to one of our own Preceptories, what shouldwe say but that the noble knight was possessed by some evil demon, or inﬂuenced by some wicked spell?—If we could suppose itotherwise, think not rank, valour, high repute, or any earthly consideration, should prevent us from visiting him with punishment, thatthe evil thing might be removed, even according to the text, ‘Auferte malum ex vobis’. For various and heinous are the acts oftransgression against the rule of our blessed Order in this lamentable history.—1st, He hath walked according to his proper will,contrary to capital 33, ‘Quod nullus juxta propriam voluntatem incedat’.—2d, He hath held communication with an excommunicatedperson, capital 57, ‘Ut fratres non participent cum excommunicatis’, and therefore hath a portion in ‘Anathema Maranatha’.—3d, Hehath conversed with strange women, contrary to the capital, ‘Ut fratres non conversantur cum extraneis mulieribus’.—4th, He hath notavoided, nay, he hath, it is to be feared, solicited the kiss of woman; by which, saith the last rule of our renowned Order, ‘Ut fugianturoscula’, the soldiers of the Cross are brought into a snare. For which heinous and multiplied guilt, Brian de Bois-Guilbert should becut off and cast out from our congregation, were he the right hand and right eye thereof.”He paused. A low murmur went through the assembly. Some of the younger part, who had been inclined to smile at the statute ‘Deosculis fugiendis’, became now grave enough, and anxiously waited what the Grand Master was next to propose.“Such,” he said, “and so great should indeed be the punishment of a Knight Templar, who wilfully offended against the rules of hisOrder in such weighty points. But if, by means of charms and of spells, Satan had obtained dominion over the Knight, perchancebecause he cast his eyes too lightly upon a damsel’s beauty, we are then rather to lament than chastise his backsliding; and, imposingon him only such penance as may purify him from his iniquity, we are to turn the full edge of our indignation upon the accursedinstrument, which had so well-nigh occasioned his utter falling away.—Stand forth, therefore, and bear witness, ye who havewitnessed these unhappy doings, that we may judge of the sum and bearing thereof; and judge whether our justice may be satisﬁedwith the punishment of this inﬁdel woman, or if we must go on, with a bleeding heart, to the further proceeding against our brother.”Several witnesses were called upon to prove the risks to which Bois-Guilbert exposed himself in endeavouring to save Rebeccafrom the blazing castle, and his neglect of his personal defence in attending to her safety. The men gave these details with theexaggerations common to vulgar minds which have been strongly excited by any remarkable event, and their natural disposition to themarvellous was greatly increased by the satisfaction which their evidence seemed to afford to the eminent person for whoseinformation it had been delivered. Thus the dangers which Bois-Guilbert surmounted, in themselves sufﬁciently great, becameportentous in their narrative. The devotion of the Knight to Rebecca’s defence was exaggerated beyond the bounds, not only ofdiscretion, but even of the most frantic excess of chivalrous zeal; and his deference to what she said, even although her language wasoften severe and upbraiding, was painted as carried to an excess, which, in a man of his haughty temper, seemed almost preternatural.The Preceptor of Templestowe was then called on to describe the manner in which Bois-Guilbert and the Jewess arrived at thePreceptory. The evidence of Malvoisin was skilfully guarded. But while he apparently studied to spare the feelings of Bois-Guilbert,he threw in, from time to time, such hints, as seemed to infer that he laboured under some temporary alienation of mind, so deeply didhe appear to be enamoured of the damsel whom he brought along with him. With sighs of penitence, the Preceptor avowed his owncontrition for having admitted Rebecca and her lover within the walls of the Preceptory—“But my defence,” he concluded, “has beenmade in my confession to our most reverend father the Grand Master; he knows my motives were not evil, though my conduct mayhave been irregular. Joyfully will I submit to any penance he shall assign me.”“Thou hast spoken well, Brother Albert,” said Beaumanoir; “thy motives were good, since thou didst judge it right to arrest thineerring brother in his career of precipitate folly. But thy conduct was wrong; as he that would stop a runaway steed, and seizing by thestirrup instead of the bridle, receiveth injury himself, instead of accomplishing his purpose. Thirteen paternosters are assigned by ourpious founder for matins, and nine for vespers; be those services doubled by thee. Thrice a-week are Templars permitted the use ofﬂesh; but do thou keep fast for all the seven days. This do for six weeks to come, and thy penance is accomplished.”With a hypocritical look of the deepest submission, the Preceptor of Templestowe bowed to the ground before his Superior, andresumed his seat.“Were it not well, brethren,” said the Grand Master, “that we examine something into the former life and conversation of thiswoman, specially that we may discover whether she be one likely to use magical charms and spells, since the truths which we haveheard may well incline us to suppose, that in this unhappy course our erring brother has been acted upon by some infernal enticementand delusion?”Herman of Goodalricke was the Fourth Preceptor present; the other three were Conrade, Malvoisin, and Bois-Guilbert himself.Herman was an ancient warrior, whose face was marked with scars inﬂicted by the sabre of the Moslemah, and had great rank andconsideration among his brethren. He arose and bowed to the Grand Master, who instantly granted him license of speech. “I wouldcrave to know, most Reverend Father, of our valiant brother, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, what he says to these wondrous accusations, andwith what eye he himself now regards his unhappy intercourse with this Jewish maiden?”“Brian de Bois-Guilbert,” said the Grand Master, “thou hearest the question which our Brother of Goodalricke desirest thoushouldst answer. I command thee to reply to him.”Bois-Guilbert turned his head towards the Grand Master when thus addressed, and remained silent.“He is possessed by a dumb devil,” said the Grand Master. “Avoid thee, Sathanus!—Speak, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, I conjure thee,by this symbol of our Holy Order.”Bois-Guilbert made an effort to suppress his rising scorn and indignation, the expression of which, he was well aware, would havelittle availed him. “Brian de Bois-Guilbert,” he answered, “replies not, most Reverend Father, to such wild and vague charges. If hishonour be impeached, he will defend it with his body, and with that sword which has often fought for Christendom.”“We forgive thee, Brother Brian,” said the Grand Master; “though that thou hast boasted thy warlike achievements before us, is aglorifying of thine own deeds, and cometh of the Enemy, who tempteth us to exalt our own worship. But thou hast our pardon, judgingthou speakest less of thine own suggestion than from the impulse of him whom by Heaven’s leave, we will quell and drive forth fromour assembly.” A glance of disdain ﬂashed from the dark ﬁerce eyes of Bois-Guilbert, but he made no reply.—“And now,” pursued theGrand Master, “since our Brother of Goodalricke’s question has been thus imperfectly answered, pursue we our quest, brethren, andwith our patron’s assistance, we will search to the bottom this mystery of iniquity.—Let those who have aught to witness of the lifeand conversation of this Jewish woman, stand forth before us.” There was a bustle in the lower part of the hall, and when the GrandMaster enquired the reason, it was replied, there was in the crowd a bedridden man, whom the prisoner had restored to the perfect useof his limbs, by a miraculous balsam.The poor peasant, a Saxon by birth, was dragged forward to the bar, terriﬁed at the penal consequences which he might haveincurred by the guilt of having been cured of the palsy by a Jewish damsel. Perfectly cured he certainly was not, for he supportedhimself forward on crutches to give evidence. Most unwilling was his testimony, and given with many tears; but he admitted that twoyears since, when residing at York, he was suddenly afﬂicted with a sore disease, while labouring for Isaac the rich Jew, in hisvocation of a joiner; that he had been unable to stir from his bed until the remedies applied by Rebecca’s directions, and especially awarming and spicy-smelling balsam, had in some degree restored him to the use of his limbs. Moreover, he said, she had given him apot of that precious ointment, and furnished him with a piece of money withal, to return to the house of his father, near toTemplestowe. “And may it please your gracious Reverence,” said the man, “I cannot think the damsel meant harm by me, though shehath the ill hap to be a Jewess; for even when I used her remedy, I said the Pater and the Creed, and it never operated a whit less kindly—”“Peace, slave,” said the Grand Master, “and begone! It well suits brutes like thee to be tampering and trinketing with hellish cures,and to be giving your labour to the sons of mischief. I tell thee, the ﬁend can impose diseases for the very purpose of removing them,in order to bring into credit some diabolical fashion of cure. Hast thou that unguent of which thou speakest?”The peasant, fumbling in his bosom with a trembling hand, produced a small box, bearing some Hebrew characters on the lid,which was, with most of the audience, a sure proof that the devil had stood apothecary. Beaumanoir, after crossing himself, took thebox into his hand, and, learned in most of the Eastern tongues, read with ease the motto on the lid,—“The Lion of the tribe of Judahhath conquered.”“Strange powers of Sathanas.” said he, “which can convert Scripture into blasphemy, mingling poison with our necessary food!—Isthere no leech here who can tell us the ingredients of this mystic unguent?”Two mediciners, as they called themselves, the one a monk, the other a barber, appeared, and avouched they knew nothing of thematerials, excepting that they savoured of myrrh and camphire, which they took to be Oriental herbs. But with the true professionalhatred to a successful practitioner of their art, they insinuated that, since the medicine was beyond their own knowledge, it mustnecessarily have been compounded from an unlawful and magical pharmacopeia; since they themselves, though no conjurors, fullyunderstood every branch of their art, so far as it might be exercised with the good faith of a Christian. When this medical research wasended, the Saxon peasant desired humbly to have back the medicine which he had found so salutary; but the Grand Master frownedseverely at the request. “What is thy name, fellow?” said he to the cripple.“Higg, the son of Snell,” answered the peasant.“Then Higg, son of Snell,” said the Grand Master, “I tell thee it is better to be bedridden, than to accept the beneﬁt of unbelievers’medicine that thou mayest arise and walk; better to despoil inﬁdels of their treasure by the strong hand, than to accept of thembenevolent gifts, or do them service for wages. Go thou, and do as I have said.”“Alack,” said the peasant, “an it shall not displease your Reverence, the lesson comes too late for me, for I am but a maimed man;but I will tell my two brethren, who serve the rich Rabbi Nathan Ben Samuel, that your mastership says it is more lawful to rob himthan to render him faithful service.”“Out with the prating villain!” said Beaumanoir, who was not prepared to refute this practical application of his general maxim.Higg, the son of Snell, withdrew into the crowd, but, interested in the fate of his benefactress, lingered until he should learn herdoom, even at the risk of again encountering the frown of that severe judge, the terror of which withered his very heart within him.At this period of the trial, the Grand Master commanded Rebecca to unveil herself. Opening her lips for the ﬁrst time, she repliedpatiently, but with dignity,—“That it was not the wont of the daughters of her people to uncover their faces when alone in an assemblyof strangers.” The sweet tones of her voice, and the softness of her reply, impressed on the audience a sentiment of pity and sympathy.But Beaumanoir, in whose mind the suppression of each feeling of humanity which could interfere with his imagined duty, was avirtue of itself, repeated his commands that his victim should be unveiled. The guards were about to remove her veil accordingly,when she stood up before the Grand Master and said, “Nay, but for the love of your own daughters—Alas,” she said, recollectingherself, “ye have no daughters!—yet for the remembrance of your mothers—for the love of your sisters, and of female decency, let menot be thus handled in your presence; it suits not a maiden to be disrobed by such rude grooms. I will obey you,” she added, with anexpression of patient sorrow in her voice, which had almost melted the heart of Beaumanoir himself; “ye are elders among yourpeople, and at your command I will show the features of an ill-fated maiden.”She withdrew her veil, and looked on them with a countenance in which bashfulness contended with dignity. Her exceeding beautyexcited a murmur of surprise, and the younger knights told each other with their eyes, in silent correspondence, that Brian’s bestapology was in the power of her real charms, rather than of her imaginary witchcraft. But Higg, the son of Snell, felt most deeply theeffect produced by the sight of the countenance of his benefactress.“Let me go forth,” he said to the warders at the door of the hall,—“let me go forth!—To look at her again will kill me, for I havehad a share in murdering her.”“Peace, poor man,” said Rebecca, when she heard his exclamation; “thou hast done me no harm by speaking the truth—thou canstnot aid me by thy complaints or lamentations. Peace, I pray thee—go home and save thyself.”Higg was about to be thrust out by the compassion of the warders, who were apprehensive lest his clamorous grief should drawupon them reprehension, and upon himself punishment. But he promised to be silent, and was permitted to remain. The two men-at-arms, with whom Albert Malvoisin had not failed to communicate upon the import of their testimony, were now called forward.Though both were hardened and inﬂexible villains, the sight of the captive maiden, as well as her excelling beauty, at ﬁrst appeared tostagger them; but an expressive glance from the Preceptor of Templestowe restored them to their dogged composure; and theydelivered, with a precision which would have seemed suspicious to more impartial judges, circumstances either altogether ﬁctitious ortrivial, and natural in themselves, but rendered pregnant with suspicion by the exaggerated manner in which they were told, and thesinister commentary which the witnesses added to the facts. The circumstances of their evidence would have been, in modern days,divided into two classes—those which were immaterial, and those which were actually and physically impossible. But both were, inthose ignorant and superstitions times, easily credited as proofs of guilt.—The ﬁrst class set forth, that Rebecca was heard to mutter toherself in an unknown tongue—that the songs she sung by ﬁts were of a strangely sweet sound, which made the ears of the hearertingle, and his heart throb—that she spoke at times to herself, and seemed to look upward for a reply—that her garments were of astrange and mystic form, unlike those of women of good repute—that she had rings impressed with cabalistical devices, and thatstrange characters were broidered on her veil.All these circumstances, so natural and so trivial, were gravely listened to as proofs, or, at least, as affording strong suspicions thatRebecca had unlawful correspondence with mystical powers.But there was less equivocal testimony, which the credulity of the assembly, or of the greater part, greedily swallowed, howeverincredible. One of the soldiers had seen her work a cure upon a wounded man, brought with them to the castle of Torquilstone. Shedid, he said, make certain signs upon the wound, and repeated certain mysterious words, which he blessed God he understood not,when the iron head of a square cross-bow bolt disengaged itself from the wound, the bleeding was stanched, the wound was closed,and the dying man was, within a quarter of an hour, walking upon the ramparts, and assisting the witness in managing a mangonel, ormachine for hurling stones. This legend was probably founded upon the fact, that Rebecca had attended on the wounded Ivanhoe whenin the castle of Torquilstone. But it was the more difﬁcult to dispute the accuracy of the witness, as, in order to produce real evidencein support of his verbal testimony, he drew from his pouch the very bolt-head, which, according to his story, had been miraculouslyextracted from the wound; and as the iron weighed a full ounce, it completely conﬁrmed the tale, however marvellous.His comrade had been a witness from a neighbouring battlement of the scene betwixt Rebecca and Bois-Guilbert, when she wasupon the point of precipitating herself from the top of the tower. Not to be behind his companion, this fellow stated, that he had seenRebecca perch herself upon the parapet of the turret, and there take the form of a milk-white swan, under which appearance she ﬂittedthree times round the castle of Torquilstone; then again settle on the turret, and once more assume the female form.Less than one half of this weighty evidence would have been sufﬁcient to convict any old woman, poor and ugly, even though shehad not been a Jewess. United with that fatal circumstance, the body of proof was too weighty for Rebecca’s youth, though combinedwith the most exquisite beauty.The Grand Master had collected the suffrages, and now in a solemn tone demanded of Rebecca what she had to say against thesentence of condemnation, which he was about to pronounce.“To invoke your pity,” said the lovely Jewess, with a voice somewhat tremulous with emotion, “would, I am aware, be as useless asI should hold it mean. To state that to relieve the sick and wounded of another religion, cannot be displeasing to the acknowledgedFounder of both our faiths, were also unavailing; to plead that many things which these men (whom may Heaven pardon!) havespoken against me are impossible, would avail me but little, since you believe in their possibility; and still less would it advantage meto explain, that the peculiarities of my dress, language, and manners, are those of my people—I had well-nigh said of my country, butalas! we have no country. Nor will I even vindicate myself at the expense of my oppressor, who stands there listening to the ﬁctionsand surmises which seem to convert the tyrant into the victim.—God be judge between him and me! but rather would I submit to tensuch deaths as your pleasure may denounce against me, than listen to the suit which that man of Belial has urged upon me—friendless,defenceless, and his prisoner. But he is of your own faith, and his lightest afﬁrmance would weigh down the most solemn protestationsof the distressed Jewess. I will not therefore return to himself the charge brought against me—but to himself—Yes, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, to thyself I appeal, whether these accusations are not false? as monstrous and calumnious as they are deadly?”There was a pause; all eyes turned to Brain de Bois-Guilbert. He was silent.“Speak,” she said, “if thou art a man—if thou art a Christian, speak!—I conjure thee, by the habit which thou dost wear, by thename thou dost inherit—by the knighthood thou dost vaunt—by the honour of thy mother—by the tomb and the bones of thy father—Iconjure thee to say, are these things true?”“Answer her, brother,” said the Grand Master, “if the Enemy with whom thou dost wrestle will give thee power.”In fact, Bois-Guilbert seemed agitated by contending passions, which almost convulsed his features, and it was with a constrainedvoice that at last he replied, looking to Rebecca,—“The scroll!—the scroll!”“Ay,” said Beaumanoir, “this is indeed testimony! The victim of her witcheries can only name the fatal scroll, the spell inscribed onwhich is, doubtless, the cause of his silence.”But Rebecca put another interpretation on the words extorted as it were from Bois-Guilbert, and glancing her eye upon the slip ofparchment which she continued to hold in her hand, she read written thereupon in the Arabian character, “Demand a Champion!” Themurmuring commentary which ran through the assembly at the strange reply of Bois-Guilbert, gave Rebecca leisure to examine andinstantly to destroy the scroll unobserved. When the whisper had ceased, the Grand Master spoke.“Rebecca, thou canst derive no beneﬁt from the evidence of this unhappy knight, for whom, as we well perceive, the Enemy is yettoo powerful. Hast thou aught else to say?”“There is yet one chance of life left to me,” said Rebecca, “even by your own ﬁerce laws. Life has been miserable—miserable, atleast, of late—but I will not cast away the gift of God, while he affords me the means of defending it. I deny this charge—I maintainmy innocence, and I declare the falsehood of this accusation—I challenge the privilege of trial by combat, and will appear by mychampion.”“And who, Rebecca,” replied the Grand Master, “will lay lance in rest for a sorceress? who will be the champion of a Jewess?”“God will raise me up a champion,” said Rebecca—“It cannot be that in merry England—the hospitable, the generous, the free,where so many are ready to peril their lives for honour, there will not be found one to ﬁght for justice. But it is enough that I challengethe trial by combat—there lies my gage.”She took her embroidered glove from her hand, and ﬂung it down before the Grand Master with an air of mingled simplicity anddignity, which excited universal surprise and admiration.CHAPTER XXXVIII—There I throw my gage,To prove it on thee to the extremest pointOf martial daring.RICHARD IIEven Lucas Beaumanoir himself was affected by the mien and appearance of Rebecca. He was not originally a cruel or even asevere man; but with passions by nature cold, and with a high, though mistaken, sense of duty, his heart had been gradually hardenedby the ascetic life which he pursued, the supreme power which he enjoyed, and the supposed necessity of subduing inﬁdelity anderadicating heresy, which he conceived peculiarly incumbent on him. His features relaxed in their usual severity as he gazed upon thebeautiful creature before him, alone, unfriended, and defending herself with so much spirit and courage. He crossed himself twice, asdoubting whence arose the unwonted softening of a heart, which on such occasions used to resemble in hardness the steel of hissword. At length he spoke.“Damsel,” he said, “if the pity I feel for thee arise from any practice thine evil arts have made on me, great is thy guilt. But I ratherjudge it the kinder feelings of nature, which grieves that so goodly a form should be a vessel of perdition. Repent, my daughter—confess thy witchcrafts—turn thee from thine evil faith—embrace this holy emblem, and all shall yet be well with thee here andhereafter. In some sisterhood of the strictest order, shalt thou have time for prayer and ﬁtting penance, and that repentance not to berepented of. This do and live—what has the law of Moses done for thee that thou shouldest die for it?”“It was the law of my fathers,” said Rebecca; “it was delivered in thunders and in storms upon the mountain of Sinai, in cloud andin ﬁre. This, if ye are Christians, ye believe—it is, you say, recalled; but so my teachers have not taught me.”“Let our chaplain,” said Beaumanoir, “stand forth, and tell this obstinate inﬁdel—”“Forgive the interruption,” said Rebecca, meekly; “I am a maiden, unskilled to dispute for my religion, but I can die for it, if it beGod’s will.—Let me pray your answer to my demand of a champion.”“Give me her glove,” said Beaumanoir. “This is indeed,” he continued, as he looked at the ﬂimsy texture and slender ﬁngers, “aslight and frail gage for a purpose so deadly!—Seest thou, Rebecca, as this thin and light glove of thine is to one of our heavy steelgauntlets, so is thy cause to that of the Temple, for it is our Order which thou hast deﬁed.”“Cast my innocence into the scale,” answered Rebecca, “and the glove of silk shall outweigh the glove of iron.”“Then thou dost persist in thy refusal to confess thy guilt, and in that bold challenge which thou hast made?”“I do persist, noble sir,” answered Rebecca.“So be it then, in the name of Heaven,” said the Grand Master; “and may God show the right!”“Amen,” replied the Preceptors around him, and the word was deeply echoed by the whole assembly.“Brethren,” said Beaumanoir, “you are aware that we might well have refused to this woman the beneﬁt of the trial by combat—butthough a Jewess and an unbeliever, she is also a stranger and defenceless, and God forbid that she should ask the beneﬁt of our mildlaws, and that it should be refused to her. Moreover, we are knights and soldiers as well as men of religion, and shame it were to usupon any pretence, to refuse proffered combat. Thus, therefore, stands the case. Rebecca, the daughter of Isaac of York, is, by manyfrequent and suspicious circumstances, defamed of sorcery practised on the person of a noble knight of our holy Order, and hathchallenged the combat in proof of her innocence. To whom, reverend brethren, is it your opinion that we should deliver the gage ofbattle, naming him, at the same time, to be our champion on the ﬁeld?”“To Brian de Bois-Guilbert, whom it chieﬂy concerns,” said the Preceptor of Goodalricke, “and who, moreover, best knows how thetruth stands in this matter.”“But if,” said the Grand Master, “our brother Brian be under the inﬂuence of a charm or a spell—we speak but for the sake ofprecaution, for to the arm of none of our holy Order would we more willingly conﬁde this or a more weighty cause.”“Reverend father,” answered the Preceptor of Goodalricke, “no spell can effect the champion who comes forward to ﬁght for thejudgment of God.”“Thou sayest right, brother,” said the Grand Master. “Albert Malvoisin, give this gage of battle to Brian de Bois-Guilbert.—It is ourcharge to thee, brother,” he continued, addressing himself to Bois-Guilbert, “that thou do thy battle manfully, nothing doubting that thegood cause shall triumph.—And do thou, Rebecca, attend, that we assign thee the third day from the present to ﬁnd a champion.”“That is but brief space,” answered Rebecca, “for a stranger, who is also of another faith, to ﬁnd one who will do battle, wageringlife and honour for her cause, against a knight who is called an approved soldier.”“We may not extend it,” answered the Grand Master; “the ﬁeld must be foughten in our own presence, and divers weighty causescall us on the fourth day from hence.”“God’s will be done!” said Rebecca; “I put my trust in Him, to whom an instant is as effectual to save as a whole age.”“Thou hast spoken well, damsel,” said the Grand Master; “but well know we who can array himself like an angel of light. It remainsbut to name a ﬁtting place of combat, and, if it so hap, also of execution.—Where is the Preceptor of this house?”Albert Malvoisin, still holding Rebecca’s glove in his hand, was speaking to Bois-Guilbert very earnestly, but in a low voice.“How!” said the Grand Master, “will he not receive the gage?”“He will—he doth, most Reverend Father,” said Malvoisin, slipping the glove under his own mantle. “And for the place of combat,I hold the ﬁttest to be the lists of Saint George belonging to this Preceptory, and used by us for military exercise.”“It is well,” said the Grand Master.—“Rebecca, in those lists shalt thou produce thy champion; and if thou failest to do so, or if thychampion shall be discomﬁted by the judgment of God, thou shalt then die the death of a sorceress, according to doom.—Let this ourjudgment be recorded, and the record read aloud, that no one may pretend ignorance.”judgment be recorded, and the record read aloud, that no one may pretend ignorance.”One of the chaplains, who acted as clerks to the chapter, immediately engrossed the order in a huge volume, which contained theproceedings of the Templar Knights when solemnly assembled on such occasions; and when he had ﬁnished writing, the other readaloud the sentence of the Grand Master, which, when translated from the Norman-French in which it was couched, was expressed asfollows.—“Rebecca, a Jewess, daughter of Isaac of York, being attainted of sorcery, seduction, and other damnable practices, practised on aKnight of the most Holy Order of the Temple of Zion, doth deny the same; and saith, that the testimony delivered against her this dayis false, wicked, and disloyal; and that by lawful ‘essoine’ 54 of her body as being unable to combat in her own behalf, she doth offer,by a champion instead thereof, to avouch her case, he performing his loyal ‘devoir’ in all knightly sort, with such arms as to gage ofbattle do fully appertain, and that at her peril and cost. And therewith she proffered her gage. And the gage having been delivered tothe noble Lord and Knight, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, of the Holy Order of the Temple of Zion, he was appointed to do this battle, inbehalf of his Order and himself, as injured and impaired by the practices of the appellant. Wherefore the most reverend Father andpuissant Lord, Lucas Marquis of Beaumanoir, did allow of the said challenge, and of the said ‘essoine’ of the appellant’s body, andassigned the third day for the said combat, the place being the enclosure called the lists of Saint George, near to the Preceptory ofTemplestowe. And the Grand Master appoints the appellant to appear there by her champion, on pain of doom, as a person convictedof sorcery or seduction; and also the defendant so to appear, under the penalty of being held and adjudged recreant in case of default;and the noble Lord and most reverend Father aforesaid appointed the battle to be done in his own presence, and according to all that iscommendable and proﬁtable in such a case. And may God aid the just cause!”“Amen!” said the Grand Master; and the word was echoed by all around. Rebecca spoke not, but she looked up to heaven, and,folding her hands, remained for a minute without change of attitude. She then modestly reminded the Grand Master, that she ought tobe permitted some opportunity of free communication with her friends, for the purpose of making her condition known to them, andprocuring, if possible, some champion to ﬁght in her behalf.“It is just and lawful,” said the Grand Master; “choose what messenger thou shalt trust, and he shall have free communication withthee in thy prison-chamber.”“Is there,” said Rebecca, “any one here, who, either for love of a good cause, or for ample hire, will do the errand of a distressedbeing?”All were silent; for none thought it safe, in the presence of the Grand Master, to avow any interest in the calumniated prisoner, lesthe should be suspected of leaning towards Judaism. Not even the prospect of reward, far less any feelings of compassion alone, couldsurmount this apprehension.Rebecca stood for a few moments in indescribable anxiety, and then exclaimed, “Is it really thus?—And, in English land, am I to bedeprived of the poor chance of safety which remains to me, for want of an act of charity which would not be refused to the worstcriminal?”Higg, the son of Snell, at length replied, “I am but a maimed man, but that I can at all stir or move was owing to her charitableassistance.—I will do thine errand,” he added, addressing Rebecca, “as well as a crippled object can, and happy were my limbs ﬂeetenough to repair the mischief done by my tongue. Alas! when I boasted of thy charity, I little thought I was leading thee into danger!”“God,” said Rebecca, “is the disposer of all. He can turn back the captivity of Judah, even by the weakest instrument. To execute hismessage the snail is as sure a messenger as the falcon. Seek out Isaac of York—here is that will pay for horse and man—let him havethis scroll.—I know not if it be of Heaven the spirit which inspires me, but most truly do I judge that I am not to die this death, andthat a champion will be raised up for me. Farewell!—Life and death are in thy haste.”The peasant took the scroll, which contained only a few lines in Hebrew. Many of the crowd would have dissuaded him fromtouching a document so suspicious; but Higg was resolute in the service of his benefactress. She had saved his body, he said, and hewas conﬁdent she did not mean to peril his soul.“I will get me,” he said, “my neighbour Buthan’s good capul, 55 and I will be at York within as brief space as man and beast may.”But as it fortuned, he had no occasion to go so far, for within a quarter of a mile from the gate of the Preceptory he met with tworiders, whom, by their dress and their huge yellow caps, he knew to be Jews; and, on approaching more nearly, discovered that one ofthem was his ancient employer, Isaac of York. The other was the Rabbi Ben Samuel; and both had approached as near to thePreceptory as they dared, on hearing that the Grand Master had summoned a chapter for the trial of a sorceress.“Brother Ben Samuel,” said Isaac, “my soul is disquieted, and I wot not why. This charge of necromancy is right often used forcloaking evil practices on our people.”“Be of good comfort, brother,” said the physician; “thou canst deal with the Nazarenes as one possessing the mammon ofunrighteousness, and canst therefore purchase immunity at their hands—it rules the savage minds of those ungodly men, even as thesignet of the mighty Solomon was said to command the evil genii.—But what poor wretch comes hither upon his crutches, desiring, asI think, some speech of me?—Friend,” continued the physician, addressing Higg, the son of Snell, “I refuse thee not the aid of mineart, but I relieve not with one asper those who beg for alms upon the highway. Out upon thee!—Hast thou the palsy in thy legs? thenlet thy hands work for thy livelihood; for, albeit thou be’st unﬁt for a speedy post, or for a careful shepherd, or for the warfare, or forthe service of a hasty master, yet there be occupations—How now, brother?” said he, interrupting his harangue to look towards Isaac,who had but glanced at the scroll which Higg offered, when, uttering a deep groan, he fell from his mule like a dying man, and lay fora minute insensible.The Rabbi now dismounted in great alarm, and hastily applied the remedies which his art suggested for the recovery of hiscompanion. He had even taken from his pocket a cupping apparatus, and was about to proceed to phlebotomy, when the object of hisanxious solicitude suddenly revived; but it was to dash his cap from his head, and to throw dust on his grey hairs. The physician was atﬁrst inclined to ascribe this sudden and violent emotion to the effects of insanity; and, adhering to his original purpose, began onceagain to handle his implements. But Isaac soon convinced him of his error.“Child of my sorrow,” he said, “well shouldst thou be called Benoni, instead of Rebecca! Why should thy death bring down mygrey hairs to the grave, till, in the bitterness of my heart, I curse God and die!”“Brother,” said the Rabbi, in great surprise, “art thou a father in Israel, and dost thou utter words like unto these?—I trust that thechild of thy house yet liveth?”“She liveth,” answered Isaac; “but it is as Daniel, who was called Beltheshazzar, even when within the den of the lions. She iscaptive unto those men of Belial, and they will wreak their cruelty upon her, sparing neither for her youth nor her comely favour. O!she was as a crown of green palms to my grey locks; and she must wither in a night, like the gourd of Jonah!—Child of my love!—child of my old age!—oh, Rebecca, daughter of Rachel! the darkness of the shadow of death hath encompassed thee.”“Yet read the scroll,” said the Rabbi; “peradventure it may be that we may yet ﬁnd out a way of deliverance.”“Do thou read, brother,” answered Isaac, “for mine eyes are as a fountain of water.”The physician read, but in their native language, the following words:—“To Isaac, the son of Adonikam, whom the Gentiles call Isaac of York, peace and the blessing of the promise be multiplied untothee!—My father, I am as one doomed to die for that which my soul knoweth not—even for the crime of witchcraft. My father, if astrong man can be found to do battle for my cause with sword and spear, according to the custom of the Nazarenes, and that within thelists of Templestowe, on the third day from this time, peradventure our fathers’ God will give him strength to defend the innocent, andher who hath none to help her. But if this may not be, let the virgins of our people mourn for me as for one cast off, and for the hartthat is stricken by the hunter, and for the ﬂower which is cut down by the scythe of the mower. Wherefore look now what thou doest,and whether there be any rescue. One Nazarene warrior might indeed bear arms in my behalf, even Wilfred, son of Cedric, whom theGentiles call Ivanhoe. But he may not yet endure the weight of his armour. Nevertheless, send the tidings unto him, my father; for hehath favour among the strong men of his people, and as he was our companion in the house of bondage, he may ﬁnd some one to dobattle for my sake. And say unto him, even unto him, even unto Wilfred, the son of Cedric, that if Rebecca live, or if Rebecca die, sheliveth or dieth wholly free of the guilt she is charged withal. And if it be the will of God that thou shalt be deprived of thy daughter, donot thou tarry, old man, in this land of bloodshed and cruelty; but betake thyself to Cordova, where thy brother liveth in safety, underthe shadow of the throne, even of the throne of Boabdil the Saracen; for less cruel are the cruelties of the Moors unto the race of Jacob,than the cruelties of the Nazarenes of England.”Isaac listened with tolerable composure while Ben Samuel read the letter, and then again resumed the gestures and exclamations ofOriental sorrow, tearing his garments, besprinkling his head with dust, and ejaculating, “My daughter! my daughter! ﬂesh of my ﬂesh,and bone of my bone!”“Yet,” said the Rabbi, “take courage, for this grief availeth nothing. Gird up thy loins, and seek out this Wilfred, the son of Cedric. Itmay be he will help thee with counsel or with strength; for the youth hath favour in the eyes of Richard, called of the Nazarenes Cœur-de-Lion, and the tidings that he hath returned are constant in the land. It may be that he may obtain his letter, and his signet,commanding these men of blood, who take their name from the Temple to the dishonour thereof, that they proceed not in theirpurposed wickedness.”“I will seek him out,” said Isaac, “for he is a good youth, and hath compassion for the exile of Jacob. But he cannot bear his armour,and what other Christian shall do battle for the oppressed of Zion?”“Nay, but,” said the Rabbi, “thou speakest as one that knoweth not the Gentiles. With gold shalt thou buy their valour, even as withgold thou buyest thine own safety. Be of good courage, and do thou set forward to ﬁnd out this Wilfred of Ivanhoe. I will also up andbe doing, for great sin it were to leave thee in thy calamity. I will hie me to the city of York, where many warriors and strong men areassembled, and doubt not I will ﬁnd among them some one who will do battle for thy daughter; for gold is their god, and for richeswill they pawn their lives as well as their lands.—Thou wilt fulﬁl, my brother, such promise as I may make unto them in thy name?”“Assuredly, brother,” said Isaac, “and Heaven be praised that raised me up a comforter in my misery. Howbeit, grant them not theirfull demand at once, for thou shalt ﬁnd it the quality of this accursed people that they will ask pounds, and peradventure accept ofounces—Nevertheless, be it as thou willest, for I am distracted in this thing, and what would my gold avail me if the child of my loveshould perish!”“Farewell,” said the physician, “and may it be to thee as thy heart desireth.”They embraced accordingly, and departed on their several roads. The crippled peasant remained for some time looking after them.“These dog-Jews!” said he; “to take no more notice of a free guild-brother, than if I were a bond slave or a Turk, or a circumcisedHebrew like themselves! They might have ﬂung me a mancus or two, however. I was not obliged to bring their unhallowed scrawls,and run the risk of being bewitched, as more folks than one told me. And what care I for the bit of gold that the wench gave me, if Iam to come to harm from the priest next Easter at confession, and be obliged to give him twice as much to make it up with him, and becalled the Jew’s ﬂying post all my life, as it may hap, into the bargain? I think I was bewitched in earnest when I was beside that girl!—But it was always so with Jew or Gentile, whosoever came near her—none could stay when she had an errand to go—and still,whenever I think of her, I would give shop and tools to save her life.”CHAPTER XXXIXO maid, unrelenting and cold as thou art,My bosom is proud as thine own.SEWARDIt was in the twilight of the day when her trial, if it could be called such, had taken place, that a low knock was heard at the door ofRebecca’s prison-chamber. It disturbed not the inmate, who was then engaged in the evening prayer recommended by her religion, andwhich concluded with a hymn we have ventured thus to translate into English.When Israel, of the Lord beloved,    Out of the land of bondage came,Her father’s God before her moved,    An awful guide, in smoke and ﬂame.By day, along the astonish’d lands    The cloudy pillar glided slow;By night, Arabia’s crimson’d sands    Return’d the ﬁery column’s glow.There rose the choral hymn of praise,    And trump and timbrel answer’d keen,And Zion’s daughters pour’d their lays,    With priest’s and warrior’s voice between.No portents now our foes amaze,    Forsaken Israel wanders lone;Our fathers would not know THY ways,    And THOU hast left them to their own.But, present still, though now unseen;    When brightly shines the prosperous day,Be thoughts of THEE a cloudy screen    To temper the deceitful ray.And oh, when stoops on Judah’s path    In shade and storm the frequent night,Be THOU, long-suffering, slow to wrath,    A burning, and a shining light!Our harps we left by Babel’s streams,    The tyrant’s jest, the Gentile’s scorn;No censer round our altar beams,    And mute our timbrel, trump, and horn.But THOU hast said, the blood of goat,    The ﬂesh of rams, I will not prize;A contrite heart, and humble thought,    Are mine accepted sacriﬁce.When the sounds of Rebecca’s devotional hymn had died away in silence, the low knock at the door was again renewed. “Enter,”she said, “if thou art a friend; and if a foe, I have not the means of refusing thy entrance.”“I am,” said Brian de Bois-Guilbert, entering the apartment, “friend or foe, Rebecca, as the event of this interview shall make me.”Alarmed at the sight of this man, whose licentious passion she considered as the root of her misfortunes, Rebecca drew backwardwith a cautious and alarmed, yet not a timorous demeanour, into the farthest corner of the apartment, as if determined to retreat as faras she could, but to stand her ground when retreat became no longer possible. She drew herself into an attitude not of deﬁance, but ofresolution, as one that would avoid provoking assault, yet was resolute to repel it, being offered, to the utmost of her power.“You have no reason to fear me, Rebecca,” said the Templar; “or if I must so qualify my speech, you have at least NOW no reasonto fear me.”“I fear you not, Sir Knight,” replied Rebecca, although her short-drawn breath seemed to belie the heroism of her accents; “my trustis strong, and I fear thee not.”“You have no cause,” answered Bois-Guilbert, gravely; “my former frantic attempts you have not now to dread. Within your call areguards, over whom I have no authority. They are designed to conduct you to death, Rebecca, yet would not suffer you to be insultedby any one, even by me, were my frenzy—for frenzy it is—to urge me so far.”“May Heaven be praised!” said the Jewess; “death is the least of my apprehensions in this den of evil.”“Ay,” replied the Templar, “the idea of death is easily received by the courageous mind, when the road to it is sudden and open. Athrust with a lance, a stroke with a sword, were to me little—To you, a spring from a dizzy battlement, a stroke with a sharp poniard,has no terrors, compared with what either thinks disgrace. Mark me—I say this—perhaps mine own sentiments of honour are not lessfantastic, Rebecca, than thine are; but we know alike how to die for them.”“Unhappy man,” said the Jewess; “and art thou condemned to expose thy life for principles, of which thy sober judgment does notacknowledge the solidity? Surely this is a parting with your treasure for that which is not bread—but deem not so of me. Thyresolution may ﬂuctuate on the wild and changeful billows of human opinion, but mine is anchored on the Rock of Ages.”“Silence, maiden,” answered the Templar; “such discourse now avails but little. Thou art condemned to die not a sudden and easydeath, such as misery chooses, and despair welcomes, but a slow, wretched, protracted course of torture, suited to what the diabolicalbigotry of these men calls thy crime.”“And to whom—if such my fate—to whom do I owe this?” said Rebecca “surely only to him, who, for a most selﬁsh and brutalcause, dragged me hither, and who now, for some unknown purpose of his own, strives to exaggerate the wretched fate to which heexposed me.”“Think not,” said the Templar, “that I have so exposed thee; I would have bucklered thee against such danger with my own bosom,as freely as ever I exposed it to the shafts which had otherwise reached thy life.”“Had thy purpose been the honourable protection of the innocent,” said Rebecca, “I had thanked thee for thy care—as it is, thouhast claimed merit for it so often, that I tell thee life is worth nothing to me, preserved at the price which thou wouldst exact for it.”“Truce with thine upbraidings, Rebecca,” said the Templar; “I have my own cause of grief, and brook not that thy reproaches shouldadd to it.”“What is thy purpose, then, Sir Knight?” said the Jewess; “speak it brieﬂy.—If thou hast aught to do, save to witness the miserythou hast caused, let me know it; and then, if so it please you, leave me to myself—the step between time and eternity is short butterrible, and I have few moments to prepare for it.”“I perceive, Rebecca,” said Bois-Guilbert, “that thou dost continue to burden me with the charge of distresses, which most fainwould I have prevented.”“Sir Knight,” said Rebecca, “I would avoid reproaches—But what is more certain than that I owe my death to thine unbridledpassion?”“You err—you err,”—said the Templar, hastily, “if you impute what I could neither foresee nor prevent to my purpose or agency.—Could I guess the unexpected arrival of yon dotard, whom some ﬂashes of frantic valour, and the praises yielded by fools to the stupidself-torments of an ascetic, have raised for the present above his own merits, above common sense, above me, and above the hundredsof our Order, who think and feel as men free from such silly and fantastic prejudices as are the grounds of his opinions and actions?”“Yet,” said Rebecca, “you sate a judge upon me, innocent—most innocent—as you knew me to be—you concurred in mycondemnation, and, if I aright understood, are yourself to appear in arms to assert my guilt, and assure my punishment.”“Thy patience, maiden,” replied the Templar. “No race knows so well as thine own tribes how to submit to the time, and so to trimtheir bark as to make advantage even of an adverse wind.”“Lamented be the hour,” said Rebecca, “that has taught such art to the House of Israel! but adversity bends the heart as ﬁre bendsthe stubborn steel, and those who are no longer their own governors, and the denizens of their own free independent state, must crouchbefore strangers. It is our curse, Sir Knight, deserved, doubtless, by our own misdeeds and those of our fathers; but you—you whoboast your freedom as your birthright, how much deeper is your disgrace when you stoop to soothe the prejudices of others, and thatagainst your own conviction?”“Your words are bitter, Rebecca,” said Bois-Guilbert, pacing the apartment with impatience, “but I came not hither to bandyreproaches with you.—Know that Bois-Guilbert yields not to created man, although circumstances may for a time induce him to alterhis plan. His will is the mountain stream, which may indeed be turned for a little space aside by the rock, but fails not to ﬁnd its courseto the ocean. That scroll which warned thee to demand a champion, from whom couldst thou think it came, if not from Bois-Guilbert?In whom else couldst thou have excited such interest?”“A brief respite from instant death,” said Rebecca, “which will little avail me—was this all thou couldst do for one, on whose headthou hast heaped sorrow, and whom thou hast brought near even to the verge of the tomb?”“No maiden,” said Bois-Guilbert, “this was NOT all that I purposed. Had it not been for the accursed interference of yon fanaticaldotard, and the fool of Goodalricke, who, being a Templar, affects to think and judge according to the ordinary rules of humanity, theofﬁce of the Champion Defender had devolved, not on a Preceptor, but on a Companion of the Order. Then I myself—such was mypurpose—had, on the sounding of the trumpet, appeared in the lists as thy champion, disguised indeed in the fashion of a rovingknight, who seeks adventures to prove his shield and spear; and then, let Beaumanoir have chosen not one, but two or three of thebrethren here assembled, I had not doubted to cast them out of the saddle with my single lance. Thus, Rebecca, should thine innocencehave been avouched, and to thine own gratitude would I have trusted for the reward of my victory.”“This, Sir Knight,” said Rebecca, “is but idle boasting—a brag of what you would have done had you not found it convenient to dootherwise. You received my glove, and my champion, if a creature so desolate can ﬁnd one, must encounter your lance in the lists—yet you would assume the air of my friend and protector!”“Thy friend and protector,” said the Templar, gravely, “I will yet be—but mark at what risk, or rather at what certainty, ofdishonour; and then blame me not if I make my stipulations, before I offer up all that I have hitherto held dear, to save the life of aJewish maiden.”“Speak,” said Rebecca; “I understand thee not.”“Well, then,” said Bois-Guilbert, “I will speak as freely as ever did doting penitent to his ghostly father, when placed in the trickyconfessional.—Rebecca, if I appear not in these lists I lose fame and rank—lose that which is the breath of my nostrils, the esteem, Imean, in which I am held by my brethren, and the hopes I have of succeeding to that mighty authority, which is now wielded by thebigoted dotard Lucas de Beaumanoir, but of which I should make a different use. Such is my certain doom, except I appear in armsagainst thy cause. Accursed be he of Goodalricke, who baited this trap for me! and doubly accursed Albert de Malvoisin, whowithheld me from the resolution I had formed, of hurling back the glove at the face of the superstitious and superannuated fool, wholistened to a charge so absurd, and against a creature so high in mind, and so lovely in form as thou art!”“And what now avails rant or ﬂattery?” answered Rebecca. “Thou hast made thy choice between causing to be shed the blood of aninnocent woman, or of endangering thine own earthly state and earthly hopes—What avails it to reckon together?—thy choice ismade.”“No, Rebecca,” said the knight, in a softer tone, and drawing nearer towards her; “my choice is NOT made—nay, mark, it is thine tomake the election. If I appear in the lists, I must maintain my name in arms; and if I do so, championed or unchampioned, thou diestby the stake and faggot, for there lives not the knight who hath coped with me in arms on equal issue, or on terms of vantage, saveRichard Cœur-de-Lion, and his minion of Ivanhoe. Ivanhoe, as thou well knowest, is unable to bear his corslet, and Richard is in aforeign prison. If I appear, then thou diest, even although thy charms should instigate some hot-headed youth to enter the lists in thydefence.”“And what avails repeating this so often?” said Rebecca.“Much,” replied the Templar; “for thou must learn to look at thy fate on every side.”“Well, then, turn the tapestry,” said the Jewess, “and let me see the other side.”“If I appear,” said Bois-Guilbert, “in the fatal lists, thou diest by a slow and cruel death, in pain such as they say is destined to theguilty hereafter. But if I appear not, then am I a degraded and dishonoured knight, accused of witchcraft and of communion withinﬁdels—the illustrious name which has grown yet more so under my wearing, becomes a hissing and a reproach. I lose fame, I losehonour, I lose the prospect of such greatness as scarce emperors attain to—I sacriﬁce mighty ambition, I destroy schemes built as highas the mountains with which heathens say their heaven was once nearly scaled—and yet, Rebecca,” he added, throwing himself at herfeet, “this greatness will I sacriﬁce, this fame will I renounce, this power will I forego, even now when it is half within my grasp, ifthou wilt say, Bois-Guilbert, I receive thee for my lover.”“Think not of such foolishness, Sir Knight,” answered Rebecca, “but hasten to the Regent, the Queen Mother, and to Prince John—they cannot, in honour to the English crown, allow of the proceedings of your Grand Master. So shall you give me protection withoutsacriﬁce on your part, or the pretext of requiring any requital from me.”“With these I deal not,” he continued, holding the train of her robe—“it is thee only I address; and what can counterbalance thychoice? Bethink thee, were I a ﬁend, yet death is a worse, and it is death who is my rival.”“I weigh not these evils,” said Rebecca, afraid to provoke the wild knight, yet equally determined neither to endure his passion, noreven feign to endure it. “Be a man, be a Christian! If indeed thy faith recommends that mercy which rather your tongues than youractions pretend, save me from this dreadful death, without seeking a requital which would change thy magnanimity into base barter.”“No, damsel!” said the proud Templar, springing up, “thou shalt not thus impose on me—if I renounce present fame and futureambition, I renounce it for thy sake, and we will escape in company. Listen to me, Rebecca,” he said, again softening his tone;“England,—Europe,—is not the world. There are spheres in which we may act, ample enough even for my ambition. We will go toPalestine, where Conrade, Marquis of Montserrat, is my friend—a friend free as myself from the doting scruples which fetter our free-born reason—rather with Saladin will we league ourselves, than endure the scorn of the bigots whom we contemn.—I will form newpaths to greatness,” he continued, again traversing the room with hasty strides—“Europe shall hear the loud step of him she has drivenfrom her sons!—Not the millions whom her crusaders send to slaughter, can do so much to defend Palestine—not the sabres of thethousands and ten thousands of Saracens can hew their way so deep into that land for which nations are striving, as the strength andpolicy of me and those brethren, who, in despite of yonder old bigot, will adhere to me in good and evil. Thou shalt be a queen,Rebecca—on Mount Carmel shall we pitch the throne which my valour will gain for you, and I will exchange my long-desired batoonfor a sceptre!”“A dream,” said Rebecca; “an empty vision of the night, which, were it a waking reality, affects me not. Enough, that the powerwhich thou mightest acquire, I will never share; nor hold I so light of country or religious faith, as to esteem him who is willing tobarter these ties, and cast away the bonds of the Order of which he is a sworn member, in order to gratify an unruly passion for thedaughter of another people.—Put not a price on my deliverance, Sir Knight—sell not a deed of generosity—protect the oppressed forthe sake of charity, and not for a selﬁsh advantage—Go to the throne of England; Richard will listen to my appeal from these cruelmen.”“Never, Rebecca!” said the Templar, ﬁercely. “If I renounce my Order, for thee alone will I renounce it—Ambition shall remainmine, if thou refuse my love; I will not be fooled on all hands.—Stoop my crest to Richard?—ask a boon of that heart of pride?—Never, Rebecca, will I place the Order of the Temple at his feet in my person. I may forsake the Order, I never will degrade or betrayit.”“Now God be gracious to me,” said Rebecca, “for the succour of man is well-nigh hopeless!”“It is indeed,” said the Templar; “for, proud as thou art, thou hast in me found thy match. If I enter the lists with my spear in rest,think not any human consideration shall prevent my putting forth my strength; and think then upon thine own fate—to die the dreadfuldeath of the worst of criminals—to be consumed upon a blazing pile—dispersed to the elements of which our strange forms are somystically composed—not a relic left of that graceful frame, from which we could say this lived and moved!—Rebecca, it is not inwoman to sustain this prospect—thou wilt yield to my suit.”“Bois-Guilbert,” answered the Jewess, “thou knowest not the heart of woman, or hast only conversed with those who are lost to herbest feelings. I tell thee, proud Templar, that not in thy ﬁercest battles hast thou displayed more of thy vaunted courage, than has beenshown by woman when called upon to suffer by affection or duty. I am myself a woman, tenderly nurtured, naturally fearful of danger,and impatient of pain—yet, when we enter those fatal lists, thou to ﬁght and I to suffer, I feel the strong assurance within me, that mycourage shall mount higher than thine. Farewell—I waste no more words on thee; the time that remains on earth to the daughter ofJacob must be otherwise spent—she must seek the Comforter, who may hide his face from his people, but who ever opens his ear tothe cry of those who seek him in sincerity and in truth.”“We part then thus?” said the Templar, after a short pause; “would to Heaven that we had never met, or that thou hadst been noble inbirth and Christian in faith!—Nay, by Heaven! when I gaze on thee, and think when and how we are next to meet, I could even wishmyself one of thine own degraded nation; my hand conversant with ingots and shekels, instead of spear and shield; my head bentdown before each petty noble, and my look only terrible to the shivering and bankrupt debtor—this could I wish, Rebecca, to be nearto thee in life, and to escape the fearful share I must have in thy death.”“Thou hast spoken the Jew,” said Rebecca, “as the persecution of such as thou art has made him. Heaven in ire has driven him fromhis country, but industry has opened to him the only road to power and to inﬂuence, which oppression has left unbarred. Read theancient history of the people of God, and tell me if those, by whom Jehovah wrought such marvels among the nations, were then apeople of misers and of usurers!—And know, proud knight, we number names amongst us to which your boasted northern nobility isas the gourd compared with the cedar—names that ascend far back to those high times when the Divine Presence shook the mercy-seat between the cherubim, and which derive their splendour from no earthly prince, but from the awful V oice, which bade theirfathers be nearest of the congregation to the Vision—Such were the princes of the House of Jacob.”Rebecca’s colour rose as she boasted the ancient glories of her race, but faded as she added, with at sigh, “Such WERE the princesof Judah, now such no more!—They are trampled down like the shorn grass, and mixed with the mire of the ways. Yet are there thoseamong them who shame not such high descent, and of such shall be the daughter of Isaac the son of Adonikam! Farewell!—I envy notthy blood-won honours—I envy not thy barbarous descent from northern heathens—I envy thee not thy faith, which is ever in thymouth, but never in thy heart nor in thy practice.”“There is a spell on me, by Heaven!” said Bois-Guilbert. “I almost think yon besotted skeleton spoke truth, and that the reluctancewith which I part from thee hath something in it more than is natural.—Fair creature!” he said, approaching near her, but with greatrespect,—“so young, so beautiful, so fearless of death! and yet doomed to die, and with infamy and agony. Who would not weep forthee?—The tear, that has been a stranger to these eyelids for twenty years, moistens them as I gaze on thee. But it must be—nothingmay now save thy life. Thou and I are but the blind instruments of some irresistible fatality, that hurries us along, like goodly vesselsdriving before the storm, which are dashed against each other, and so perish. Forgive me, then, and let us part, at least, as friends part.I have assailed thy resolution in vain, and mine own is ﬁxed as the adamantine decrees of fate.”“Thus,” said Rebecca, “do men throw on fate the issue of their own wild passions. But I do forgive thee, Bois-Guilbert, though theauthor of my early death. There are noble things which cross over thy powerful mind; but it is the garden of the sluggard, and theweeds have rushed up, and conspired to choke the fair and wholesome blossom.”“Yes,” said the Templar, “I am, Rebecca, as thou hast spoken me, untaught, untamed—and proud, that, amidst a shoal of emptyfools and crafty bigots, I have retained the preeminent fortitude that places me above them. I have been a child of battle from myyouth upward, high in my views, steady and inﬂexible in pursuing them. Such must I remain—proud, inﬂexible, and unchanging; andof this the world shall have proof.—But thou forgivest me, Rebecca?”“As freely as ever victim forgave her executioner.”“Farewell, then,” said the Templar, and left the apartment.The Preceptor Albert waited impatiently in an adjacent chamber the return of Bois-Guilbert.“Thou hast tarried long,” he said; “I have been as if stretched on red-hot iron with very impatience. What if the Grand Master, or hisspy Conrade, had come hither? I had paid dear for my complaisance.—But what ails thee, brother?—Thy step totters, thy brow is asblack as night. Art thou well, Bois-Guilbert?”“Ay,” answered the Templar, “as well as the wretch who is doomed to die within an hour.—Nay, by the rood, not half so well—forthere be those in such state, who can lay down life like a cast-off garment. By Heaven, Malvoisin, yonder girl hath well-nighunmanned me. I am half resolved to go to the Grand Master, abjure the Order to his very teeth, and refuse to act the brutality which histyranny has imposed on me.”“Thou art mad,” answered Malvoisin; “thou mayst thus indeed utterly ruin thyself, but canst not even ﬁnd a chance thereby to savethe life of this Jewess, which seems so precious in thine eyes. Beaumanoir will name another of the Order to defend his judgment inthy place, and the accused will as assuredly perish as if thou hadst taken the duty imposed on thee.”“’Tis false—I will myself take arms in her behalf,” answered the Templar, haughtily; “and, should I do so, I think, Malvoisin, thatthou knowest not one of the Order, who will keep his saddle before the point of my lance.”“Ay, but thou forgettest,” said the wily adviser, “thou wilt have neither leisure nor opportunity to execute this mad project. Go toLucas Beaumanoir, and say thou hast renounced thy vow of obedience, and see how long the despotic old man will leave thee inpersonal freedom. The words shall scarce have left thy lips, ere thou wilt either be an hundred feet under ground, in the dungeon of thePreceptory, to abide trial as a recreant knight; or, if his opinion holds concerning thy possession, thou wilt be enjoying straw, darkness,and chains, in some distant convent cell, stunned with exorcisms, and drenched with holy water, to expel the foul ﬁend which hathobtained dominion over thee. Thou must to the lists, Brian, or thou art a lost and dishonoured man.”“I will break forth and ﬂy,” said Bois-Guilbert—“ﬂy to some distant land, to which folly and fanaticism have not yet found theirway. No drop of the blood of this most excellent creature shall be spilled by my sanction.”“Thou canst not ﬂy,” said the Preceptor; “thy ravings have excited suspicion, and thou wilt not be permitted to leave the Preceptory.Go and make the essay—present thyself before the gate, and command the bridge to be lowered, and mark what answer thou shaltreceive.—Thou are surprised and offended; but is it not the better for thee? Wert thou to ﬂy, what would ensue but the reversal of thyarms, the dishonour of thine ancestry, the degradation of thy rank?—Think on it. Where shall thine old companions in arms hide theirheads when Brian de Bois-Guilbert, the best lance of the Templars, is proclaimed recreant, amid the hisses of the assembled people?What grief will be at the Court of France! With what joy will the haughty Richard hear the news, that the knight that set him hard inPalestine, and well-nigh darkened his renown, has lost fame and honour for a Jewish girl, whom he could not even save by so costly asacriﬁce!”“Malvoisin,” said the Knight, “I thank thee—thou hast touched the string at which my heart most readily thrills!—Come of it whatmay, recreant shall never be added to the name of Bois-Guilbert. Would to God, Richard, or any of his vaunting minions of England,would appear in these lists! But they will be empty—no one will risk to break a lance for the innocent, the forlorn.”“The better for thee, if it prove so,” said the Preceptor; “if no champion appears, it is not by thy means that this unlucky damselshall die, but by the doom of the Grand Master, with whom rests all the blame, and who will count that blame for praise andcommendation.”“True,” said Bois-Guilbert; “if no champion appears, I am but a part of the pageant, sitting indeed on horseback in the lists, buthaving no part in what is to follow.”“None whatever,” said Malvoisin; “no more than the armed image of Saint George when it makes part of a procession.”“Well, I will resume my resolution,” replied the haughty Templar. “She has despised me—repulsed me—reviled me—Andwherefore should I offer up for her whatever of estimation I have in the opinion of others? Malvoisin, I will appear in the lists.”He left the apartment hastily as he uttered these words, and the Preceptor followed, to watch and conﬁrm him in his resolution; forin Bois-Guilbert’s fame he had himself a strong interest, expecting much advantage from his being one day at the head of the Order,not to mention the preferment of which Mont-Fitchet had given him hopes, on condition he would forward the condemnation of theunfortunate Rebecca. Yet although, in combating his friend’s better feelings, he possessed all the advantage which a wily, composed,selﬁsh disposition has over a man agitated by strong and contending passions, it required all Malvoisin’s art to keep Bois-Guilbertsteady to the purpose he had prevailed on him to adopt. He was obliged to watch him closely to prevent his resuming his purpose ofﬂight, to intercept his communication with the Grand Master, lest he should come to an open rupture with his Superior, and to renew,from time to time, the various arguments by which he endeavoured to show, that, in appearing as champion on this occasion, Bois-Guilbert, without either accelerating or ensuring the fate of Rebecca, would follow the only course by which he could save himselffrom degradation and disgrace.CHAPTER XLShadows avaunt!—Richard’s himself again.RICHARD IIIWhen the Black Knight—for it becomes necessary to resume the train of his adventures—left the Trysting-tree of the generousOutlaw, he held his way straight to a neighbouring religious house, of small extent and revenue, called the Priory of Saint Botolph, towhich the wounded Ivanhoe had been removed when the castle was taken, under the guidance of the faithful Gurth, and themagnanimous Wamba. It is unnecessary at present to mention what took place in the interim betwixt Wilfred and his deliverer; sufﬁceit to say, that after long and grave communication, messengers were dispatched by the Prior in several directions, and that on thesucceeding morning the Black Knight was about to set forth on his journey, accompanied by the jester Wamba, who attended as hisguide.“We will meet,” he said to Ivanhoe, “at Coningsburgh, the castle of the deceased Athelstane, since there thy father Cedric holds thefuneral feast for his noble relation. I would see your Saxon kindred together, Sir Wilfred, and become better acquainted with them thanheretofore. Thou also wilt meet me; and it shall be my task to reconcile thee to thy father.”So saying, he took an affectionate farewell of Ivanhoe, who expressed an anxious desire to attend upon his deliverer. But the BlackKnight would not listen to the proposal.“Rest this day; thou wilt have scarce strength enough to travel on the next. I will have no guide with me but honest Wamba, whocan play priest or fool as I shall be most in the humour.”“And I,” said Wamba, “will attend you with all my heart. I would fain see the feasting at the funeral of Athelstane; for, if it be notfull and frequent, he will rise from the dead to rebuke cook, sewer, and cupbearer; and that were a sight worth seeing. Always, SirKnight, I will trust your valour with making my excuse to my master Cedric, in case mine own wit should fail.”“And how should my poor valour succeed, Sir Jester, when thy light wit halts?—resolve me that.”“Wit, Sir Knight,” replied the Jester, “may do much. He is a quick, apprehensive knave, who sees his neighbours blind side, andknows how to keep the lee-gage when his passions are blowing high. But valour is a sturdy fellow, that makes all split. He rowsagainst both wind and tide, and makes way notwithstanding; and, therefore, good Sir Knight, while I take advantage of the fairweather in our noble master’s temper, I will expect you to bestir yourself when it grows rough.”“Sir Knight of the Fetterlock, since it is your pleasure so to be distinguished,” said Ivanhoe, “I fear me you have chosen a talkativeand a troublesome fool to be your guide. But he knows every path and alley in the woods as well as e’er a hunter who frequents them;and the poor knave, as thou hast partly seen, is as faithful as steel.”“Nay,” said the Knight, “an he have the gift of showing my road, I shall not grumble with him that he desires to make it pleasant.—Fare thee well, kind Wilfred—I charge thee not to attempt to travel till to-morrow at earliest.”So saying, he extended his hand to Ivanhoe, who pressed it to his lips, took leave of the Prior, mounted his horse, and departed, withWamba for his companion. Ivanhoe followed them with his eyes, until they were lost in the shades of the surrounding forest, and thenreturned into the convent.But shortly after matin-song, he requested to see the Prior. The old man came in haste, and enquired anxiously after the state of hishealth.“It is better,” he said, “than my fondest hope could have anticipated; either my wound has been slighter than the effusion of bloodled me to suppose, or this balsam hath wrought a wonderful cure upon it. I feel already as if I could bear my corslet; and so much thebetter, for thoughts pass in my mind which render me unwilling to remain here longer in inactivity.”“Now, the saints forbid,” said the Prior, “that the son of the Saxon Cedric should leave our convent ere his wounds were healed! Itwere shame to our profession were we to suffer it.”“Nor would I desire to leave your hospitable roof, venerable father,” said Ivanhoe, “did I not feel myself able to endure the journey,and compelled to undertake it.”“And what can have urged you to so sudden a departure?” said the Prior.“Have you never, holy father,” answered the Knight, “felt an apprehension of approaching evil, for which you in vain attempted toassign a cause?—Have you never found your mind darkened, like the sunny landscape, by the sudden cloud, which augurs a comingtempest?—And thinkest thou not that such impulses are deserving of attention, as being the hints of our guardian spirits, that danger isimpending?”“I may not deny,” said the Prior, crossing himself, “that such things have been, and have been of Heaven; but then suchcommunications have had a visibly useful scope and tendency. But thou, wounded as thou art, what avails it thou shouldst follow thesteps of him whom thou couldst not aid, were he to be assaulted?”“Prior,” said Ivanhoe, “thou dost mistake—I am stout enough to exchange buffets with any who will challenge me to such a trafﬁc—But were it otherwise, may I not aid him were he in danger, by other means than by force of arms? It is but too well known that theSaxons love not the Norman race, and who knows what may be the issue, if he break in upon them when their hearts are irritated bythe death of Athelstane, and their heads heated by the carousal in which they will indulge themselves? I hold his entrance among themat such a moment most perilous, and I am resolved to share or avert the danger; which, that I may the better do, I would crave of theethe use of some palfrey whose pace may be softer than that of my ‘destrier’.” 56“Surely,” said the worthy churchman; “you shall have mine own ambling jennet, and I would it ambled as easy for your sake as thatof the Abbot of Saint Albans. Yet this will I say for Malkin, for so I call her, that unless you were to borrow a ride on the juggler’ssteed that paces a hornpipe amongst the eggs, you could not go a journey on a creature so gentle and smooth-paced. I have composedmany a homily on her back, to the ediﬁcation of my brethren of the convent, and many poor Christian souls.”“I pray you, reverend father,” said Ivanhoe, “let Malkin be got ready instantly, and bid Gurth attend me with mine arms.”“Nay, but fair sir,” said the Prior, “I pray you to remember that Malkin hath as little skill in arms as her master, and that I warrantnot her enduring the sight or weight of your full panoply. O, Malkin, I promise you, is a beast of judgment, and will contend againstany undue weight—I did but borrow the ‘Fructus Temporum’ from the priest of Saint Bees, and I promise you she would not stir fromthe gate until I had exchanged the huge volume for my little breviary.”“Trust me, holy father,” said Ivanhoe, “I will not distress her with too much weight; and if she calls a combat with me, it is odds butshe has the worst.”This reply was made while Gurth was buckling on the Knight’s heels a pair of large gilded spurs, capable of convincing any restivehorse that his best safety lay in being conformable to the will of his rider.The deep and sharp rowels with which Ivanhoe’s heels were now armed, began to make the worthy Prior repent of his courtesy, andejaculate,—“Nay, but fair sir, now I bethink me, my Malkin abideth not the spur—Better it were that you tarry for the mare of ourmanciple down at the Grange, which may be had in little more than an hour, and cannot but be tractable, in respect that she drawethmuch of our winter ﬁre-wood, and eateth no corn.”“I thank you, reverend father, but will abide by your ﬁrst offer, as I see Malkin is already led forth to the gate. Gurth shall carrymine armour; and for the rest, rely on it, that as I will not overload Malkin’s back, she shall not overcome my patience. And now,farewell!”Ivanhoe now descended the stairs more hastily and easily than his wound promised, and threw himself upon the jennet, eager toescape the importunity of the Prior, who stuck as closely to his side as his age and fatness would permit, now singing the praises ofMalkin, now recommending caution to the Knight in managing her.“She is at the most dangerous period for maidens as well as mares,” said the old man, laughing at his own jest, “being barely in herﬁfteenth year.”Ivanhoe, who had other web to weave than to stand canvassing a palfrey’s paces with its owner, lent but a deaf ear to the Prior’sgrave advices and facetious jests, and having leapt on his mare, and commanded his squire (for such Gurth now called himself) tokeep close by his side, he followed the track of the Black Knight into the forest, while the Prior stood at the gate of the conventlooking after him, and ejaculating,—“Saint Mary! how prompt and ﬁery be these men of war! I would I had not trusted Malkin to hiskeeping, for, crippled as I am with the cold rheum, I am undone if aught but good befalls her. And yet,” said he, recollecting himself,“as I would not spare my own old and disabled limbs in the good cause of Old England, so Malkin must e’en run her hazard on thesame venture; and it may be they will think our poor house worthy of some muniﬁcent guerdon—or, it may be, they will send the oldPrior a pacing nag. And if they do none of these, as great men will forget little men’s service, truly I shall hold me well repaid inhaving done that which is right. And it is now well-nigh the ﬁtting time to summon the brethren to breakfast in the refectory—Ah! Idoubt they obey that call more cheerily than the bells for primes and matins.”So the Prior of Saint Botolph’s hobbled back again into the refectory, to preside over the stockﬁsh and ale, which was just servingout for the friars’ breakfast. Busy and important, he sat him down at the table, and many a dark word he threw out, of beneﬁts to beexpected to the convent, and high deeds of service done by himself, which, at another season, would have attracted observation. But asthe stockﬁsh was highly salted, and the ale reasonably powerful, the jaws of the brethren were too anxiously employed to admit oftheir making much use of their ears; nor do we read of any of the fraternity, who was tempted to speculate upon the mysterious hintsof their Superior, except Father Diggory, who was severely afﬂicted by the toothache, so that he could only eat on one side of his jaws.In the meantime, the Black Champion and his guide were pacing at their leisure through the recesses of the forest; the good Knightwhiles humming to himself the lay of some enamoured troubadour, sometimes encouraging by questions the prating disposition of hisattendant, so that their dialogue formed a whimsical mixture of song and jest, of which we would fain give our readers some idea. Youare then to imagine this Knight, such as we have already described him, strong of person, tall, broad-shouldered, and large of bone,mounted on his mighty black charger, which seemed made on purpose to bear his weight, so easily he paced forward under it, havingthe visor of his helmet raised, in order to admit freedom of breath, yet keeping the beaver, or under part, closed, so that his featurescould be but imperfectly distinguished. But his ruddy embrowned cheek-bones could be plainly seen, and the large and bright blueeyes, that ﬂashed from under the dark shade of the raised visor; and the whole gesture and look of the champion expressed carelessgaiety and fearless conﬁdence—a mind which was unapt to apprehend danger, and prompt to defy it when most imminent—yet withwhom danger was a familiar thought, as with one whose trade was war and adventure.The Jester wore his usual fantastic habit, but late accidents had led him to adopt a good cutting falchion, instead of his woodensword, with a targe to match it; of both which weapons he had, notwithstanding his profession, shown himself a skilful master duringthe storming of Torquilstone. Indeed, the inﬁrmity of Wamba’s brain consisted chieﬂy in a kind of impatient irritability, which sufferedhim not long to remain quiet in any posture, or adhere to any certain train of ideas, although he was for a few minutes alert enough inperforming any immediate task, or in apprehending any immediate topic. On horseback, therefore, he was perpetually swinginghimself backwards and forwards, now on the horse’s ears, then anon on the very rump of the animal,—now hanging both his legs onone side, and now sitting with his face to the tail, moping, mowing, and making a thousand apish gestures, until his palfrey took hisfreaks so much to heart, as fairly to lay him at his length on the green grass—an incident which greatly amused the Knight, butcompelled his companion to ride more steadily thereafter.At the point of their journey at which we take them up, this joyous pair were engaged in singing a virelai, as it was called, in whichthe clown bore a mellow burden, to the better instructed Knight of the Fetterlock. And thus run the ditty:—Anna-Marie, love, up is the sun,Anna-Marie, love, morn is begun,Mists are dispersing, love, birds singing free,Up in the morning, love, Anna-Marie.Anna-Marie, love, up in the morn,The hunter is winding blithe sounds on his horn,The echo rings merry from rock and from tree,’Tis time to arouse thee, love, Anna-Marie.Wamba.O Tybalt, love, Tybalt, awake me not yet,Around my soft pillow while softer dreams ﬂit,For what are the joys that in waking we prove,Compared with these visions, O, Tybalt, my love?Let the birds to the rise of the mist carol shrill,Let the hunter blow out his loud horn on the hill,Softer sounds, softer pleasures, in slumber I prove,—But think not I dreamt of thee, Tybalt, my love.“A dainty song,” said Wamba, when they had ﬁnished their carol, “and I swear by my bauble, a pretty moral!—I used to sing it withGurth, once my playfellow, and now, by the grace of God and his master, no less than a freemen; and we once came by the cudgel forbeing so entranced by the melody, that we lay in bed two hours after sunrise, singing the ditty betwixt sleeping and waking—my bonesache at thinking of the tune ever since. Nevertheless, I have played the part of Anna-Marie, to please you, fair sir.”The Jester next struck into another carol, a sort of comic ditty, to which the Knight, catching up the tune, replied in the like manner.Knight and Wamba.There came three merry men from south, west, and north,    Ever more sing the roundelay;To win the Widow of Wycombe forth,    And where was the widow might say them nay?The ﬁrst was a knight, and from Tynedale he came,    Ever more sing the roundelay;And his fathers, God save us, were men of great fame,    And where was the widow might say him nay?Of his father the laird, of his uncle the squire,    He boasted in rhyme and in roundelay;She bade him go bask by his sea-coal ﬁre,    For she was the widow would say him nay.Wamba.The next that came forth, swore by blood and by nails,    Merrily sing the roundelay;Hur’s a gentleman, God wot, and hur’s lineage was of Wales,    And where was the widow might say him nay?Sir David ap Morgan ap Grifﬁth ap Hugh    Ap Tudor ap Rhice, quoth his roundelayShe said that one widow for so many was too few,    And she bade the Welshman wend his way.But then next came a yeoman, a yeoman of Kent,    Jollily singing his roundelay;He spoke to the widow of living and rent,    And where was the widow could say him nay?Both.So the knight and the squire were both left in the mire,    There for to sing their roundelay;For a yeoman of Kent, with his yearly rent,    There never was a widow could say him nay.“I would, Wamba,” said the knight, “that our host of the Trysting-tree, or the jolly Friar, his chaplain, heard this thy ditty in praise ofour bluff yeoman.”“So would not I,” said Wamba—“but for the horn that hangs at your baldric.”“Ay,” said the Knight,—“this is a pledge of Locksley’s goodwill, though I am not like to need it. Three mots on this bugle will, I amassured, bring round, at our need, a jolly band of yonder honest yeomen.”“I would say, Heaven forefend,” said the Jester, “were it not that that fair gift is a pledge they would let us pass peaceably.”“Why, what meanest thou?” said the Knight; “thinkest thou that but for this pledge of fellowship they would assault us?”“Nay, for me I say nothing,” said Wamba; “for green trees have ears as well as stone walls. But canst thou construe me this, SirKnight—When is thy wine-pitcher and thy purse better empty than full?”“Why, never, I think,” replied the Knight.“Thou never deservest to have a full one in thy hand, for so simple an answer! Thou hadst best empty thy pitcher ere thou pass it toa Saxon, and leave thy money at home ere thou walk in the greenwood.”“You hold our friends for robbers, then?” said the Knight of the Fetterlock.“You hear me not say so, fair sir,” said Wamba; “it may relieve a man’s steed to take of his mail when he hath a long journey tomake; and, certes, it may do good to the rider’s soul to ease him of that which is the root of evil; therefore will I give no hard names tothose who do such services. Only I would wish my mail at home, and my purse in my chamber, when I meet with these good fellows,because it might save them some trouble.”“WE are bound to pray for them, my friend, notwithstanding the fair character thou dost afford them.”“Pray for them with all my heart,” said Wamba; “but in the town, not in the greenwood, like the Abbot of Saint Bees, whom theycaused to say mass with an old hollow oak-tree for his stall.”“Say as thou list, Wamba,” replied the Knight, “these yeomen did thy master Cedric yeomanly service at Torquilstone.”“Ay, truly,” answered Wamba; “but that was in the fashion of their trade with Heaven.”“Their trade, Wamba! how mean you by that?” replied his companion.“Marry, thus,” said the Jester. “They make up a balanced account with Heaven, as our old cellarer used to call his ciphering, as fairas Isaac the Jew keeps with his debtors, and, like him, give out a very little, and take large credit for doing so; reckoning, doubtless, ontheir own behalf the seven-fold usury which the blessed text hath promised to charitable loans.”“Give me an example of your meaning, Wamba,—I know nothing of ciphers or rates of usage,” answered the Knight.“Why,” said Wamba, “an your valour be so dull, you will please to learn that those honest fellows balance a good deed with one notquite so laudable; as a crown given to a begging friar with an hundred byzants taken from a fat abbot, or a wench kissed in thegreenwood with the relief of a poor widow.”“Which of these was the good deed, which was the felony?” interrupted the Knight.“A good gibe! a good gibe!” said Wamba; “keeping witty company sharpeneth the apprehension. You said nothing so well, SirKnight, I will be sworn, when you held drunken vespers with the bluff Hermit.—But to go on. The merry-men of the forest set off thebuilding of a cottage with the burning of a castle,—the thatching of a choir against the robbing of a church,—the setting free a poorprisoner against the murder of a proud sheriff; or, to come nearer to our point, the deliverance of a Saxon franklin against the burningalive of a Norman baron. Gentle thieves they are, in short, and courteous robbers; but it is ever the luckiest to meet with them whenthey are at the worst.”“How so, Wamba?” said the Knight.“Why, then they have some compunction, and are for making up matters with Heaven. But when they have struck an even balance,Heaven help them with whom they next open the account! The travellers who ﬁrst met them after their good service at Torquilstonewould have a woeful ﬂaying.—And yet,” said Wamba, coming close up to the Knight’s side, “there be companions who are far moredangerous for travellers to meet than yonder outlaws.”“And who may they be, for you have neither bears nor wolves, I trow?” said the Knight.“Marry, sir, but we have Malvoisin’s men-at-arms,” said Wamba; “and let me tell you, that, in time of civil war, a halfscore of theseis worth a band of wolves at any time. They are now expecting their harvest, and are reinforced with the soldiers that escaped fromTorquilstone. So that, should we meet with a band of them, we are like to pay for our feats of arms.—Now, I pray you, Sir Knight,what would you do if we met two of them?”“Pin the villains to the earth with my lance, Wamba, if they offered us any impediment.”“But what if there were four of them?”“They should drink of the same cup,” answered the Knight.“What if six,” continued Wamba, “and we as we now are, barely two—would you not remember Locksley’s horn?”“What! sound for aid,” exclaimed the Knight, “against a score of such ‘rascaille’ as these, whom one good knight could drive beforehim, as the wind drives the withered leaves?”“Nay, then,” said Wamba, “I will pray you for a close sight of that same horn that hath so powerful a breath.”The Knight undid the clasp of the baldric, and indulged his fellow-traveller, who immediately hung the bugle round his own neck.“Tra-lira-la,” said he, whistling the notes; “nay, I know my gamut as well as another.”“How mean you, knave?” said the Knight; “restore me the bugle.”“Content you, Sir Knight, it is in safe keeping. When Valour and Folly travel, Folly should bear the horn, because she can blow thebest.”“Nay but, rogue,” said the Black Knight, “this exceedeth thy license—Beware ye tamper not with my patience.”“Urge me not with violence, Sir Knight,” said the Jester, keeping at a distance from the impatient champion, “or Folly will show aclean pair of heels, and leave Valour to ﬁnd out his way through the wood as best he may.”“Nay, thou hast hit me there,” said the Knight; “and, sooth to say, I have little time to jangle with thee. Keep the horn an thou wilt,but let us proceed on our journey.”“You will not harm me, then?” said Wamba.“I tell thee no, thou knave!”“Ay, but pledge me your knightly word for it,” continued Wamba, as he approached with great caution.“My knightly word I pledge; only come on with thy foolish self.”“Nay, then, Valour and Folly are once more boon companions,” said the Jester, coming up frankly to the Knight’s side; “but, intruth, I love not such buffets as that you bestowed on the burly Friar, when his holiness rolled on the green like a king of the nine-pins.And now that Folly wears the horn, let Valour rouse himself, and shake his mane; for, if I mistake not, there are company in yonderbrake that are on the look-out for us.”“What makes thee judge so?” said the Knight.“Because I have twice or thrice noticed the glance of a motion from amongst the green leaves. Had they been honest men, they hadkept the path. But yonder thicket is a choice chapel for the Clerks of Saint Nicholas.”“By my faith,” said the Knight, closing his visor, “I think thou be’st in the right on’t.”And in good time did he close it, for three arrows, ﬂew at the same instant from the suspected spot against his head and breast, oneof which would have penetrated to the brain, had it not been turned aside by the steel visor. The other two were averted by the gorget,and by the shield which hung around his neck.“Thanks, trusty armourers,” said the Knight.—“Wamba, let us close with them,”—and he rode straight to the thicket. He was metby six or seven men-at-arms, who ran against him with their lances at full career. Three of the weapons struck against him, andsplintered with as little effect as if they had been driven against a tower of steel. The Black Knight’s eyes seemed to ﬂash ﬁre eventhrough the aperture of his visor. He raised himself in his stirrups with an air of inexpressible dignity, and exclaimed, “What meansthis, my masters!”—The men made no other reply than by drawing their swords and attacking him on every side, crying, “Die,tyrant!”“Ha! Saint Edward! Ha! Saint George!” said the Black Knight, striking down a man at every invocation; “have we traitors here?”His opponents, desperate as they were, bore back from an arm which carried death in every blow, and it seemed as if the terror ofhis single strength was about to gain the battle against such odds, when a knight, in blue armour, who had hitherto kept himself behindthe other assailants, spurred forward with his lance, and taking aim, not at the rider but at the steed, wounded the noble animalmortally.“That was a felon stroke!” exclaimed the Black Knight, as the steed fell to the earth, bearing his rider along with him.And at this moment, Wamba winded the bugle, for the whole had passed so speedily, that he had not time to do so sooner. Thesudden sound made the murderers bear back once more, and Wamba, though so imperfectly weaponed, did not hesitate to rush in andassist the Black Knight to rise.“Shame on ye, false cowards!” exclaimed he in the blue harness, who seemed to lead the assailants, “do ye ﬂy from the empty blastof a horn blown by a Jester?”Animated by his words, they attacked the Black Knight anew, whose best refuge was now to place his back against an oak, anddefend himself with his sword. The felon knight, who had taken another spear, watching the moment when his formidable antagonistwas most closely pressed, galloped against him in hopes to nail him with his lance against the tree, when his purpose was againintercepted by Wamba. The Jester, making up by agility the want of strength, and little noticed by the men-at-arms, who were busiedin their more important object, hovered on the skirts of the ﬁght, and effectually checked the fatal career of the Blue Knight, byhamstringing his horse with a stroke of his sword. Horse and man went to the ground; yet the situation of the Knight of the Fetterlockcontinued very precarious, as he was pressed close by several men completely armed, and began to be fatigued by the violentexertions necessary to defend himself on so many points at nearly the same moment, when a grey-goose shaft suddenly stretched onthe earth one of the most formidable of his assailants, and a band of yeomen broke forth from the glade, headed by Locksley and thejovial Friar, who, taking ready and effectual part in the fray, soon disposed of the rufﬁans, all of whom lay on the spot dead or mortallywounded. The Black Knight thanked his deliverers with a dignity they had not observed in his former bearing, which hitherto hadseemed rather that of a blunt bold soldier, than of a person of exalted rank.“It concerns me much,” he said, “even before I express my full gratitude to my ready friends, to discover, if I may, who have beenmy unprovoked enemies.—Open the visor of that Blue Knight, Wamba, who seems the chief of these villains.”The Jester instantly made up to the leader of the assassins, who, bruised by his fall, and entangled under the wounded steed, layincapable either of ﬂight or resistance.“Come, valiant sir,” said Wamba, “I must be your armourer as well as your equerry—I have dismounted you, and now I will unhelmyou.”So saying, with no very gentle hand he undid the helmet of the Blue Knight, which, rolling to a distance on the grass, displayed tothe Knight of the Fetterlock grizzled locks, and a countenance he did not expect to have seen under such circumstances.“Waldemar Fitzurse!” he said in astonishment; “what could urge one of thy rank and seeming worth to so foul an undertaking?”“Richard,” said the captive Knight, looking up to him, “thou knowest little of mankind, if thou knowest not to what ambition andrevenge can lead every child of Adam.”“Revenge?” answered the Black Knight; “I never wronged thee—On me thou hast nought to revenge.”“My daughter, Richard, whose alliance thou didst scorn—was that no injury to a Norman, whose blood is noble as thine own?”“Thy daughter?” replied the Black Knight; “a proper cause of enmity, and followed up to a bloody issue!—Stand back, my masters,I would speak to him alone.—And now, Waldemar Fitzurse, say me the truth—confess who set thee on this traitorous deed.”“Thy father’s son,” answered Waldemar, “who, in so doing, did but avenge on thee thy disobedience to thy father.”Richard’s eyes sparkled with indignation, but his better nature overcame it. He pressed his hand against his brow, and remained aninstant gazing on the face of the humbled baron, in whose features pride was contending with shame.“Thou dost not ask thy life, Waldemar,” said the King.“He that is in the lion’s clutch,” answered Fitzurse, “knows it were needless.”“Take it, then, unasked,” said Richard; “the lion preys not on prostrate carcasses.—Take thy life, but with this condition, that inthree days thou shalt leave England, and go to hide thine infamy in thy Norman castle, and that thou wilt never mention the name ofJohn of Anjou as connected with thy felony. If thou art found on English ground after the space I have allotted thee, thou diest—or ifthou breathest aught that can attaint the honour of my house, by Saint George! not the altar itself shall be a sanctuary. I will hang theeout to feed the ravens, from the very pinnacle of thine own castle.—Let this knight have a steed, Locksley, for I see your yeomen havecaught those which were running loose, and let him depart unharmed.”“But that I judge I listen to a voice whose behests must not be disputed,” answered the yeoman, “I would send a shaft after theskulking villain that should spare him the labour of a long journey.”“Thou bearest an English heart, Locksley,” said the Black Knight, “and well dost judge thou art the more bound to obey my behest—I am Richard of England!”At these words, pronounced in a tone of majesty suited to the high rank, and no less distinguished character of Cœur-de-Lion, theyeomen at once kneeled down before him, and at the same time tendered their allegiance, and implored pardon for their offences.“Rise, my friends,” said Richard, in a gracious tone, looking on them with a countenance in which his habitual good-humour hadalready conquered the blaze of hasty resentment, and whose features retained no mark of the late desperate conﬂict, excepting theﬂush arising from exertion,—“Arise,” he said, “my friends!—Your misdemeanours, whether in forest or ﬁeld, have been atoned by theloyal services you rendered my distressed subjects before the walls of Torquilstone, and the rescue you have this day afforded to yoursovereign. Arise, my liegemen, and be good subjects in future.—And thou, brave Locksley—”“Call me no longer Locksley, my Liege, but know me under the name, which, I fear, fame hath blown too widely not to havereached even your royal ears—I am Robin Hood of Sherwood Forest.” 561“King of Outlaws, and Prince of good fellows!” said the King, “who hath not heard a name that has been borne as far as Palestine?But be assured, brave Outlaw, that no deed done in our absence, and in the turbulent times to which it hath given rise, shall beremembered to thy disadvantage.”“True says the proverb,” said Wamba, interposing his word, but with some abatement of his usual petulance,—“‘When the cat is away,The mice will play.’”“What, Wamba, art thou there?” said Richard; “I have been so long of hearing thy voice, I thought thou hadst taken ﬂight.”“I take ﬂight!” said Wamba; “when do you ever ﬁnd Folly separated from Valour? There lies the trophy of my sword, that good greygelding, whom I heartily wish upon his legs again, conditioning his master lay there houghed in his place. It is true, I gave a littleground at ﬁrst, for a motley jacket does not brook lance-heads, as a steel doublet will. But if I fought not at sword’s point, you willgrant me that I sounded the onset.”“And to good purpose, honest Wamba,” replied the King. “Thy good service shall not be forgotten.”“‘Conﬁteor! Conﬁteor!’”—exclaimed, in a submissive tone, a voice near the King’s side—“my Latin will carry me no farther—butI confess my deadly treason, and pray leave to have absolution before I am led to execution!”Richard looked around, and beheld the jovial Friar on his knees, telling his rosary, while his quarter-staff, which had not been idleduring the skirmish, lay on the grass beside him. His countenance was gathered so as he thought might best express the most profoundcontrition, his eyes being turned up, and the corners of his mouth drawn down, as Wamba expressed it, like the tassels at the mouth ofa purse. Yet this demure affectation of extreme penitence was whimsically belied by a ludicrous meaning which lurked in his hugefeatures, and seemed to pronounce his fear and repentance alike hypocritical.“For what art thou cast down, mad Priest?” said Richard; “art thou afraid thy diocesan should learn how truly thou dost serve OurLady and Saint Dunstan?—Tush, man! fear it not; Richard of England betrays no secrets that pass over the ﬂagon.”“Nay, most gracious sovereign,” answered the Hermit, (well known to the curious in penny-histories of Robin Hood, by the name ofFriar Tuck,) “it is not the crosier I fear, but the sceptre.—Alas! that my sacrilegious ﬁst should ever have been applied to the ear of theLord’s anointed!”“Ha! ha!” said Richard, “sits the wind there?—In truth I had forgotten the buffet, though mine ear sung after it for a whole day. Butif the cuff was fairly given, I will be judged by the good men around, if it was not as well repaid—or, if thou thinkest I still owe theeaught, and will stand forth for another counterbuff—”“By no means,” replied Friar Tuck, “I had mine own returned, and with usury—may your Majesty ever pay your debts as fully!”“By no means,” replied Friar Tuck, “I had mine own returned, and with usury—may your Majesty ever pay your debts as fully!”“If I could do so with cuffs,” said the King, “my creditors should have little reason to complain of an empty exchequer.”“And yet,” said the Friar, resuming his demure hypocritical countenance, “I know not what penance I ought to perform for that mostsacrilegious blow!—-”“Speak no more of it, brother,” said the King; “after having stood so many cuffs from Paynims and misbelievers, I were void ofreason to quarrel with the buffet of a clerk so holy as he of Copmanhurst. Yet, mine honest Friar, I think it would be best both for thechurch and thyself, that I should procure a license to unfrock thee, and retain thee as a yeoman of our guard, serving in care of ourperson, as formerly in attendance upon the altar of Saint Dunstan.”“My Liege,” said the Friar, “I humbly crave your pardon; and you would readily grant my excuse, did you but know how the sin oflaziness has beset me. Saint Dunstan—may he be gracious to us!—stands quiet in his niche, though I should forget my orisons inkilling a fat buck—I stay out of my cell sometimes a night, doing I wot not what—Saint Dunstan never complains—a quiet master heis, and a peaceful, as ever was made of wood.—But to be a yeoman in attendance on my sovereign the King—the honour is great,doubtless—yet, if I were but to step aside to comfort a widow in one corner, or to kill a deer in another, it would be, ‘where is the dogPriest?’ says one. ‘Who has seen the accursed Tuck?’ says another. ‘The unfrocked villain destroys more venison than half the countrybesides,’ says one keeper; ‘And is hunting after every shy doe in the country!’ quoth a second.—In ﬁne, good my Liege, I pray you toleave me as you found me; or, if in aught you desire to extend your benevolence to me, that I may be considered as the poor Clerk ofSaint Dunstan’s cell in Copmanhurst, to whom any small donation will be most thankfully acceptable.”“I understand thee,” said the King, “and the Holy Clerk shall have a grant of vert and venison in my woods of Warncliffe. Mark,however, I will but assign thee three bucks every season; but if that do not prove an apology for thy slaying thirty, I am no Christianknight nor true king.”“Your Grace may be well assured,” said the Friar, “that, with the grace of Saint Dunstan, I shall ﬁnd the way of multiplying yourmost bounteous gift.”“I nothing doubt it, good brother,” said the King; “and as venison is but dry food, our cellarer shall have orders to deliver to thee abutt of sack, a runlet of Malvoisie, and three hogsheads of ale of the ﬁrst strike, yearly—If that will not quench thy thirst, thou mustcome to court, and become acquainted with my butler.”“But for Saint Dunstan?” said the Friar—“A cope, a stole, and an altar-cloth shalt thou also have,” continued the King, crossing himself—“But we may not turn our gameinto earnest, lest God punish us for thinking more on our follies than on his honour and worship.”“I will answer for my patron,” said the Priest, joyously.“Answer for thyself, Friar,” said King Richard, something sternly; but immediately stretching out his hand to the Hermit, the latter,somewhat abashed, bent his knee, and saluted it. “Thou dost less honour to my extended palm than to my clenched ﬁst,” said theMonarch; “thou didst only kneel to the one, and to the other didst prostrate thyself.”But the Friar, afraid perhaps of again giving offence by continuing the conversation in too jocose a style—a false step to beparticularly guarded against by those who converse with monarchs—bowed profoundly, and fell into the rear.At the same time, two additional personages appeared on the scene.CHAPTER XLIAll hail to the lordlings of high degree,Who live not more happy, though greater than we!    Our pastimes to see,    Under every green tree,In all the gay woodland, right welcome ye be.MACDONALDThe new comers were Wilfred of Ivanhoe, on the Prior of Botolph’s palfrey, and Gurth, who attended him, on the Knight’s ownwar-horse. The astonishment of Ivanhoe was beyond bounds, when he saw his master besprinkled with blood, and six or seven deadbodies lying around in the little glade in which the battle had taken place. Nor was he less surprised to see Richard surrounded by somany silvan attendants, the outlaws, as they seemed to be, of the forest, and a perilous retinue therefore for a prince. He hesitatedwhether to address the King as the Black Knight-errant, or in what other manner to demean himself towards him. Richard saw hisembarrassment.“Fear not, Wilfred,” he said, “to address Richard Plantagenet as himself, since thou seest him in the company of true English hearts,although it may be they have been urged a few steps aside by warm English blood.”“Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe,” said the gallant Outlaw, stepping forward, “my assurances can add nothing to those of our sovereign; yet,let me say somewhat proudly, that of men who have suffered much, he hath not truer subjects than those who now stand around him.”“I cannot doubt it, brave man,” said Wilfred, “since thou art of the number—But what mean these marks of death and danger? theseslain men, and the bloody armour of my Prince?”“Treason hath been with us, Ivanhoe,” said the King; “but, thanks to these brave men, treason hath met its meed—But, now Ibethink me, thou too art a traitor,” said Richard, smiling; “a most disobedient traitor; for were not our orders positive, that thoushouldst repose thyself at Saint Botolph’s until thy wound was healed?”“It is healed,” said Ivanhoe; “it is not of more consequence than the scratch of a bodkin. But why, oh why, noble Prince, will youthus vex the hearts of your faithful servants, and expose your life by lonely journeys and rash adventures, as if it were of no morevalue than that of a mere knight-errant, who has no interest on earth but what lance and sword may procure him?”“And Richard Plantagenet,” said the King, “desires no more fame than his good lance and sword may acquire him—and RichardPlantagenet is prouder of achieving an adventure, with only his good sword, and his good arm to speed, than if he led to battle a hostof an hundred thousand armed men.”“But your kingdom, my Liege,” said Ivanhoe, “your kingdom is threatened with dissolution and civil war—your subjects menacedwith every species of evil, if deprived of their sovereign in some of those dangers which it is your daily pleasure to incur, and fromwhich you have but this moment narrowly escaped.”“Ho! ho! my kingdom and my subjects?” answered Richard, impatiently; “I tell thee, Sir Wilfred, the best of them are most willingto repay my follies in kind—For example, my very faithful servant, Wilfred of Ivanhoe, will not obey my positive commands, and yetreads his king a homily, because he does not walk exactly by his advice. Which of us has most reason to upbraid the other?—Yetforgive me, my faithful Wilfred. The time I have spent, and am yet to spend in concealment, is, as I explained to thee at SaintBotolph’s, necessary to give my friends and faithful nobles time to assemble their forces, that when Richard’s return is announced, heshould be at the head of such a force as enemies shall tremble to face, and thus subdue the meditated treason, without evenunsheathing a sword. Estoteville and Bohun will not be strong enough to move forward to York for twenty-four hours. I must havenews of Salisbury from the south; and of Beauchamp, in Warwickshire; and of Multon and Percy in the north. The Chancellor mustmake sure of London. Too sudden an appearance would subject me to dangers, other than my lance and sword, though backed by thebow of bold Robin, or the quarter-staff of Friar Tuck, and the horn of the sage Wamba, may be able to rescue me from.”Wilfred bowed in submission, well knowing how vain it was to contend with the wild spirit of chivalry which so often impelled hismaster upon dangers which he might easily have avoided, or rather, which it was unpardonable in him to have sought out. The youngknight sighed, therefore, and held his peace; while Richard, rejoiced at having silenced his counsellor, though his heart acknowledgedthe justice of the charge he had brought against him, went on in conversation with Robin Hood.—“King of Outlaws,” he said, “haveyou no refreshment to offer to your brother sovereign? for these dead knaves have found me both in exercise and appetite.”“In troth,” replied the Outlaw, “for I scorn to lie to your Grace, our larder is chieﬂy supplied with—” He stopped, and wassomewhat embarrassed.“With venison, I suppose?” said Richard, gaily; “better food at need there can be none—and truly, if a king will not remain at homeand slay his own game, methinks he should not brawl too loud if he ﬁnds it killed to his hand.”“If your Grace, then,” said Robin, “will again honour with your presence one of Robin Hood’s places of rendezvous, the venisonshall not be lacking; and a stoup of ale, and it may be a cup of reasonably good wine, to relish it withal.”The Outlaw accordingly led the way, followed by the buxom Monarch, more happy, probably, in this chance meeting with RobinHood and his foresters, than he would have been in again assuming his royal state, and presiding over a splendid circle of peers andnobles. Novelty in society and adventure were the zest of life to Richard Cœur-de-Lion, and it had its highest relish when enhanced bydangers encountered and surmounted. In the lion-hearted King, the brilliant, but useless character, of a knight of romance, was in agreat measure realized and revived; and the personal glory which he acquired by his own deeds of arms, was far more dear to hisexcited imagination, than that which a course of policy and wisdom would have spread around his government. Accordingly, his reignwas like the course of a brilliant and rapid meteor, which shoots along the face of Heaven, shedding around an unnecessary andportentous light, which is instantly swallowed up by universal darkness; his feats of chivalry furnishing themes for bards andminstrels, but affording none of those solid beneﬁts to his country on which history loves to pause, and hold up as an example toposterity. But in his present company Richard showed to the greatest imaginable advantage. He was gay, good-humoured, and fond ofmanhood in every rank of life.Beneath a huge oak-tree the silvan repast was hastily prepared for the King of England, surrounded by men outlaws to hisgovernment, but who now formed his court and his guard. As the ﬂagon went round, the rough foresters soon lost their awe for thepresence of Majesty. The song and the jest were exchanged—the stories of former deeds were told with advantage; and at length, andwhile boasting of their successful infraction of the laws, no one recollected they were speaking in presence of their natural guardian.The merry King, nothing heeding his dignity any more than his company, laughed, quaffed, and jested among the jolly band. Thenatural and rough sense of Robin Hood led him to be desirous that the scene should be closed ere any thing should occur to disturb itsharmony, the more especially that he observed Ivanhoe’s brow clouded with anxiety. “We are honoured,” he said to Ivanhoe, apart,“by the presence of our gallant Sovereign; yet I would not that he dallied with time, which the circumstances of his kingdom mayrender precious.”“It is well and wisely spoken, brave Robin Hood,” said Wilfred, apart; “and know, moreover, that they who jest with Majesty evenin its gayest mood are but toying with the lion’s whelp, which, on slight provocation, uses both fangs and claws.”“You have touched the very cause of my fear,” said the Outlaw; “my men are rough by practice and nature, the King is hasty as wellas good-humoured; nor know I how soon cause of offence may arise, or how warmly it may be received—it is time this revel werebroken off.”“It must be by your management then, gallant yeoman,” said Ivanhoe; “for each hint I have essayed to give him serves only toinduce him to prolong it.”“Must I so soon risk the pardon and favour of my Sovereign?” said Robin Hood, pausing for all instant; “but by Saint Christopher, itshall be so. I were undeserving his grace did I not peril it for his good.—Here, Scathlock, get thee behind yonder thicket, and wind mea Norman blast on thy bugle, and without an instant’s delay on peril of your life.”Scathlock obeyed his captain, and in less than ﬁve minutes the revellers were startled by the sound of his horn.“It is the bugle of Malvoisin,” said the Miller, starting to his feet, and seizing his bow. The Friar dropped the ﬂagon, and grasped hisquarter-staff. Wamba stopt short in the midst of a jest, and betook himself to sword and target. All the others stood to their weapons.Men of their precarious course of life change readily from the banquet to the battle; and, to Richard, the exchange seemed but asuccession of pleasure. He called for his helmet and the most cumbrous parts of his armour, which he had laid aside; and while Gurthwas putting them on, he laid his strict injunctions on Wilfred, under pain of his highest displeasure, not to engage in the skirmishwhich he supposed was approaching.“Thou hast fought for me an hundred times, Wilfred,—and I have seen it. Thou shalt this day look on, and see how Richard willﬁght for his friend and liegeman.”In the meantime, Robin Hood had sent off several of his followers in different directions, as if to reconnoitre the enemy; and whenhe saw the company effectually broken up, he approached Richard, who was now completely armed, and, kneeling down on one knee,craved pardon of his Sovereign.“For what, good yeoman?” said Richard, somewhat impatiently. “Have we not already granted thee a full pardon for alltransgressions? Thinkest thou our word is a feather, to be blown backward and forward between us? Thou canst not have had time tocommit any new offence since that time?”“Ay, but I have though,” answered the yeoman, “if it be an offence to deceive my prince for his own advantage. The bugle you haveheard was none of Malvoisin’s, but blown by my direction, to break off the banquet, lest it trenched upon hours of dearer import thanto be thus dallied with.”He then rose from his knee, folded his arm on his bosom, and in a manner rather respectful than submissive, awaited the answer ofthe King,—like one who is conscious he may have given offence, yet is conﬁdent in the rectitude of his motive. The blood rushed inanger to the countenance of Richard; but it was the ﬁrst transient emotion, and his sense of justice instantly subdued it.“The King of Sherwood,” he said, “grudges his venison and his wine-ﬂask to the King of England? It is well, bold Robin!—butwhen you come to see me in merry London, I trust to be a less niggard host. Thou art right, however, good fellow. Let us therefore tohorse and away—Wilfred has been impatient this hour. Tell me, bold Robin, hast thou never a friend in thy band, who, not contentwith advising, will needs direct thy motions, and look miserable when thou dost presume to act for thyself?”“Such a one,” said Robin, “is my Lieutenant, Little John, who is even now absent on an expedition as far as the borders of Scotland;and I will own to your Majesty, that I am sometimes displeased by the freedom of his councils—but, when I think twice, I cannot belong angry with one who can have no motive for his anxiety save zeal for his master’s service.”“Thou art right, good yeoman,” answered Richard; “and if I had Ivanhoe, on the one hand, to give grave advice, and recommend itby the sad gravity of his brow, and thee, on the other, to trick me into what thou thinkest my own good, I should have as little thefreedom of mine own will as any king in Christendom or Heathenesse.—But come, sirs, let us merrily on to Coningsburgh, and thinkno more on’t.”Robin Hood assured them that he had detached a party in the direction of the road they were to pass, who would not fail to discoverand apprize them of any secret ambuscade; and that he had little doubt they would ﬁnd the ways secure, or, if otherwise, would receivesuch timely notice of the danger as would enable them to fall back on a strong troop of archers, with which he himself proposed tofollow on the same route.The wise and attentive precautions adopted for his safety touched Richard’s feelings, and removed any slight grudge which hemight retain on account of the deception the Outlaw Captain had practised upon him. He once more extended his hand to Robin Hood,assured him of his full pardon and future favour, as well as his ﬁrm resolution to restrain the tyrannical exercise of the forest rights andother oppressive laws, by which so many English yeomen were driven into a state of rebellion. But Richard’s good intentions towardsthe bold Outlaw were frustrated by the King’s untimely death; and the Charter of the Forest was extorted from the unwilling hands ofKing John when he succeeded to his heroic brother. As for the rest of Robin Hood’s career, as well as the tale of his treacherous death,they are to be found in those black-letter garlands, once sold at the low and easy rate of one halfpenny.“Now cheaply purchased at their weight in gold.”The Outlaw’s opinion proved true; and the King, attended by Ivanhoe, Gurth, and Wamba, arrived, without any interruption, withinview of the Castle of Coningsburgh, while the sun was yet in the horizon.There are few more beautiful or striking scenes in England, than are presented by the vicinity of this ancient Saxon fortress. Thesoft and gentle river Don sweeps through an amphitheatre, in which cultivation is richly blended with woodland, and on a mount,ascending from the river, well defended by walls and ditches, rises this ancient ediﬁce, which, as its Saxon name implies, was,previous to the Conquest, a royal residence of the kings of England. The outer walls have probably been added by the Normans, butthe inner keep bears token of very great antiquity. It is situated on a mount at one angle of the inner court, and forms a complete circleof perhaps twenty-ﬁve feet in diameter. The wall is of immense thickness, and is propped or defended by six huge external buttresseswhich project from the circle, and rise up against the sides of the tower as if to strengthen or to support it. These massive buttresses aresolid when they arise from the foundation, and a good way higher up; but are hollowed out towards the top, and terminate in a sort ofturrets communicating with the interior of the keep itself. The distant appearance of this huge building, with these singularaccompaniments, is as interesting to the lovers of the picturesque, as the interior of the castle is to the eager antiquary, whoseimagination it carries back to the days of the Heptarchy. A barrow, in the vicinity of the castle, is pointed out as the tomb of thememorable Hengist; and various monuments, of great antiquity and curiosity, are shown in the neighbouring churchyard. 57When Cœur-de-Lion and his retinue approached this rude yet stately building, it was not, as at present, surrounded by externalfortiﬁcations. The Saxon architect had exhausted his art in rendering the main keep defensible, and there was no other circumvallationthan a rude barrier of palisades.A huge black banner, which ﬂoated from the top of the tower, announced that the obsequies of the late owner were still in the act ofbeing solemnized. It bore no emblem of the deceased’s birth or quality, for armorial bearings were then a novelty among the Normanchivalry themselves and, were totally unknown to the Saxons. But above the gate was another banner, on which the ﬁgure of a whitehorse, rudely painted, indicated the nation and rank of the deceased, by the well-known symbol of Hengist and his Saxon warriors.All around the castle was a scene of busy commotion; for such funeral banquets were times of general and profuse hospitality,which not only every one who could claim the most distant connexion with the deceased, but all passengers whatsoever, were invitedto partake. The wealth and consequence of the deceased Athelstane, occasioned this custom to be observed in the fullest extent.Numerous parties, therefore, were seen ascending and descending the hill on which the castle was situated; and when the King andhis attendants entered the open and unguarded gates of the external barrier, the space within presented a scene not easily reconciledwith the cause of the assemblage. In one place cooks were toiling to roast huge oxen, and fat sheep; in another, hogsheads of ale wereset abroach, to be drained at the freedom of all comers. Groups of every description were to be seen devouring the food andswallowing the liquor thus abandoned to their discretion. The naked Saxon serf was drowning the sense of his half-year’s hunger andthirst, in one day of gluttony and drunkenness—the more pampered burgess and guild-brother was eating his morsel with gust, orcuriously criticising the quantity of the malt and the skill of the brewer. Some few of the poorer Norman gentry might also be seen,distinguished by their shaven chins and short cloaks, and not less so by their keeping together, and looking with great scorn on thewhole solemnity, even while condescending to avail themselves of the good cheer which was so liberally supplied.Mendicants were of course assembled by the score, together with strolling soldiers returned from Palestine, (according to their ownaccount at least,) pedlars were displaying their wares, travelling mechanics were enquiring after employment, and wandering palmers,hedge-priests, Saxon minstrels, and Welsh bards, were muttering prayers, and extracting mistuned dirges from their harps, crowds, androtes. 58One sent forth the praises of Athelstane in a doleful panegyric; another, in a Saxon genealogical poem, rehearsed the uncouth andharsh names of his noble ancestry. Jesters and jugglers were not awanting, nor was the occasion of the assembly supposed to renderthe exercise of their profession indecorous or improper. Indeed the ideas of the Saxons on these occasions were as natural as they wererude. If sorrow was thirsty, there was drink—if hungry, there was food—if it sunk down upon and saddened the heart, here were themeans supplied of mirth, or at least of amusement. Nor did the assistants scorn to avail themselves of those means of consolation,although, every now and then, as if suddenly recollecting the cause which had brought them together, the men groaned in unison,while the females, of whom many were present, raised up their voices and shrieked for very woe.Such was the scene in the castle-yard at Coningsburgh when it was entered by Richard and his followers. The seneschal or stewarddeigned not to take notice of the groups of inferior guests who were perpetually entering and withdrawing, unless so far as wasnecessary to preserve order; nevertheless he was struck by the good mien of the Monarch and Ivanhoe, more especially as he imaginedthe features of the latter were familiar to him. Besides, the approach of two knights, for such their dress bespoke them, was a rareevent at a Saxon solemnity, and could not but be regarded as a sort of honour to the deceased and his family. And in his sable dress,and holding in his hand his white wand of ofﬁce, this important personage made way through the miscellaneous assemblage of guests,thus conducting Richard and Ivanhoe to the entrance of the tower. Gurth and Wamba speedily found acquaintances in the court-yard,nor presumed to intrude themselves any farther until their presence should be required.CHAPTER XLIII found them winding of Marcello’s corpse.And there was such a solemn melody,’Twixt doleful songs, tears, and sad elegies,—Such as old grandames, watching by the dead,Are wont to outwear the night with.OLD PLAYThe mode of entering the great tower of Coningsburgh Castle is very peculiar, and partakes of the rude simplicity of the early timesin which it was erected. A ﬂight of steps, so deep and narrow as to be almost precipitous, leads up to a low portal in the south side ofthe tower, by which the adventurous antiquary may still, or at least could a few years since, gain access to a small stair within thethickness of the main wall of the tower, which leads up to the third story of the building,—the two lower being dungeons or vaults,which neither receive air nor light, save by a square hole in the third story, with which they seem to have communicated by a ladder.The access to the upper apartments in the tower which consist in all of four stories, is given by stairs which are carried up through theexternal buttresses.By this difﬁcult and complicated entrance, the good King Richard, followed by his faithful Ivanhoe, was ushered into the roundapartment which occupies the whole of the third story from the ground. Wilfred, by the difﬁculties of the ascent, gained time to mufﬂehis face in his mantle, as it had been held expedient that he should not present himself to his father until the King should give him thesignal.There were assembled in this apartment, around a large oaken table, about a dozen of the most distinguished representatives of theSaxon families in the adjacent counties. They were all old, or, at least, elderly men; for the younger race, to the great displeasure of theseniors, had, like Ivanhoe, broken down many of the barriers which separated for half a century the Norman victors from thevanquished Saxons. The downcast and sorrowful looks of these venerable men, their silence and their mournful posture, formed astrong contrast to the levity of the revellers on the outside of the castle. Their grey locks and long full beards, together with theirantique tunics and loose black mantles, suited well with the singular and rude apartment in which they were seated, and gave theappearance of a band of ancient worshippers of Woden, recalled to life to mourn over the decay of their national glory.Cedric, seated in equal rank among his countrymen, seemed yet, by common consent, to act as chief of the assembly. Upon theentrance of Richard (only known to him as the valorous Knight of the Fetterlock) he arose gravely, and gave him welcome by theordinary salutation, “Waes hael”, raising at the same time a goblet to his head. The King, no stranger to the customs of his Englishsubjects, returned the greeting with the appropriate words, “Drinc hael”, and partook of a cup which was handed to him by the sewer.The same courtesy was offered to Ivanhoe, who pledged his father in silence, supplying the usual speech by an inclination of his head,lest his voice should have been recognised.When this introductory ceremony was performed, Cedric arose, and, extending his hand to Richard, conducted him into a small andvery rude chapel, which was excavated, as it were, out of one of the external buttresses. As there was no opening, saving a littlenarrow loop-hole, the place would have been nearly quite dark but for two ﬂambeaux or torches, which showed, by a red and smokylight, the arched roof and naked walls, the rude altar of stone, and the cruciﬁx of the same material.Before this altar was placed a bier, and on each side of this bier kneeled three priests, who told their beads, and muttered theirprayers, with the greatest signs of external devotion. For this service a splendid “soul-scat” was paid to the convent of Saint Edmund’sby the mother of the deceased; and, that it might be fully deserved, the whole brethren, saving the lame Sacristan, had transferredthemselves to Coningsburgh, where, while six of their number were constantly on guard in the performance of divine rites by the bierof Athelstane, the others failed not to take their share of the refreshments and amusements which went on at the castle. In maintainingthis pious watch and ward, the good monks were particularly careful not to interrupt their hymns for an instant, lest Zernebock, theancient Saxon Apollyon, should lay his clutches on the departed Athelstane. Nor were they less careful to prevent any unhallowedlayman from touching the pall, which, having been that used at the funeral of Saint Edmund, was liable to be desecrated, if handled bythe profane. If, in truth, these attentions could be of any use to the deceased, he had some right to expect them at the hands of thebrethren of Saint Edmund’s, since, besides a hundred mancuses of gold paid down as the soul-ransom, the mother of Athelstane hadannounced her intention of endowing that foundation with the better part of the lands of the deceased, in order to maintain perpetualprayers for his soul, and that of her departed husband. Richard and Wilfred followed the Saxon Cedric into the apartment of death,where, as their guide pointed with solemn air to the untimely bier of Athelstane, they followed his example in devoutly crossingthemselves, and muttering a brief prayer for the weal of the departed soul.This act of pious charity performed, Cedric again motioned them to follow him, gliding over the stone ﬂoor with a noiseless tread;and, after ascending a few steps, opened with great caution the door of a small oratory, which adjoined to the chapel. It was abouteight feet square, hollowed, like the chapel itself, out of the thickness of the wall; and the loop-hole, which enlightened it, being to thewest, and widening considerably as it sloped inward, a beam of the setting sun found its way into its dark recess, and showed a femaleof a digniﬁed mien, and whose countenance retained the marked remains of majestic beauty. Her long mourning robes and her ﬂowingwimple of black cypress, enhanced the whiteness of her skin, and the beauty of her light-coloured and ﬂowing tresses, which time hadneither thinned nor mingled with silver. Her countenance expressed the deepest sorrow that is consistent with resignation. On the stonetable before her stood a cruciﬁx of ivory, beside which was laid a missal, having its pages richly illuminated, and its boards adornedwith clasps of gold, and bosses of the same precious metal.“Noble Edith,” said Cedric, after having stood a moment silent, as if to give Richard and Wilfred time to look upon the lady of themansion, “these are worthy strangers, come to take a part in thy sorrows. And this, in especial, is the valiant Knight who fought sobravely for the deliverance of him for whom we this day mourn.”“His bravery has my thanks,” returned the lady; “although it be the will of Heaven that it should be displayed in vain. I thank, too,his courtesy, and that of his companion, which hath brought them hither to behold the widow of Adeling, the mother of Athelstane, inher deep hour of sorrow and lamentation. To your care, kind kinsman, I intrust them, satisﬁed that they will want no hospitality whichthese sad walls can yet afford.”The guests bowed deeply to the mourning parent, and withdrew from their hospitable guide.Another winding stair conducted them to an apartment of the same size with that which they had ﬁrst entered, occupying indeed thestory immediately above. From this room, ere yet the door was opened, proceeded a low and melancholy strain of vocal music. Whenthey entered, they found themselves in the presence of about twenty matrons and maidens of distinguished Saxon lineage. Fourmaidens, Rowena leading the choir, raised a hymn for the soul of the deceased, of which we have only been able to decipher two orthree stanzas:—Dust unto dust,To this all must;The tenant hath resign’dThe faded formTo waste and worm—Corruption claims her kind.Through paths unknownThy soul hath ﬂown,To seek the realms of woe,Where ﬁery painShall purge the stainOf actions done below.In that sad place,By Mary’s grace,Brief may thy dwelling beTill prayers and alms,And holy psalms,Shall set the captive free.While this dirge was sung, in a low and melancholy tone, by the female choristers, the others were divided into two bands, of whichone was engaged in bedecking, with such embroidery as their skill and taste could compass, a large silken pall, destined to cover thebier of Athelstane, while the others busied themselves in selecting, from baskets of ﬂowers placed before them, garlands, which theyintended for the same mournful purpose. The behaviour of the maidens was decorous, if not marked with deep afﬂiction; but now andthen a whisper or a smile called forth the rebuke of the severer matrons, and here and there might be seen a damsel more interested inendeavouring to ﬁnd out how her mourning-robe became her, than in the dismal ceremony for which they were preparing. Neither wasthis propensity (if we must needs confess the truth) at all diminished by the appearance of two strange knights, which occasioned somelooking up, peeping, and whispering. Rowena alone, too proud to be vain, paid her greeting to her deliverer with a graceful courtesy.Her demeanour was serious, but not dejected; and it may be doubted whether thoughts of Ivanhoe, and of the uncertainty of his fate,did not claim as great a share in her gravity as the death of her kinsman.To Cedric, however, who, as we have observed, was not remarkably clear-sighted on such occasions, the sorrow of his ward seemedso much deeper than any of the other maidens, that he deemed it proper to whisper the explanation—“She was the afﬁanced bride ofthe noble Athelstane.”—It may be doubted whether this communication went a far way to increase Wilfred’s disposition to sympathizewith the mourners of Coningsburgh.Having thus formally introduced the guests to the different chambers in which the obsequies of Athelstane were celebrated underdifferent forms, Cedric conducted them into a small room, destined, as he informed them, for the exclusive accomodation ofhonourable guests, whose more slight connexion with the deceased might render them unwilling to join those who were immediatelyeffected by the unhappy event. He assured them of every accommodation, and was about to withdraw when the Black Knight took hishand.“I crave to remind you, noble Thane,” he said, “that when we last parted, you promised, for the service I had the fortune to renderyou, to grant me a boon.”“It is granted ere named, noble Knight,” said Cedric; “yet, at this sad moment—-”“Of that also,” said the King, “I have bethought me—but my time is brief—neither does it seem to me unﬁt, that, when closing thegrave on the noble Athelstane, we should deposit therein certain prejudices and hasty opinions.”“Sir Knight of the Fetterlock,” said Cedric, colouring, and interrupting the King in his turn, “I trust your boon regards yourself andno other; for in that which concerns the honour of my house, it is scarce ﬁtting that a stranger should mingle.”“Nor do I wish to mingle,” said the King, mildly, “unless in so far as you will admit me to have an interest. As yet you have knownme but as the Black Knight of the Fetterlock—Know me now as Richard Plantagenet.”“Richard of Anjou!” exclaimed Cedric, stepping backward with the utmost astonishment.“No, noble Cedric—Richard of England!—whose deepest interest—whose deepest wish, is to see her sons united with each other.—And, how now, worthy Thane! hast thou no knee for thy prince?”“To Norman blood,” said Cedric, “it hath never bended.”“Reserve thine homage then,” said the Monarch, “until I shall prove my right to it by my equal protection of Normans and English.”“Prince,” answered Cedric, “I have ever done justice to thy bravery and thy worth—Nor am I ignorant of thy claim to the crownthrough thy descent from Matilda, niece to Edgar Atheling, and daughter to Malcolm of Scotland. But Matilda, though of the royalSaxon blood, was not the heir to the monarchy.”“I will not dispute my title with thee, noble Thane,” said Richard, calmly; “but I will bid thee look around thee, and see where thouwilt ﬁnd another to be put into the scale against it.”“And hast thou wandered hither, Prince, to tell me so?” said Cedric—“To upbraid me with the ruin of my race, ere the grave hasclosed o’er the last scion of Saxon royalty?”—His countenance darkened as he spoke.—“It was boldly—it was rashly done!”“Not so, by the holy rood!” replied the King; “it was done in the frank conﬁdence which one brave man may repose in another,without a shadow of danger.”“Thou sayest well, Sir King—for King I own thou art, and wilt be, despite of my feeble opposition.—I dare not take the only modeto prevent it, though thou hast placed the strong temptation within my reach!”“And now to my boon,” said the King, “which I ask not with one jot the less conﬁdence, that thou hast refused to acknowledge mylawful sovereignty. I require of thee, as a man of thy word, on pain of being held faithless, man-sworn, and ‘nidering’, 581 to forgiveand receive to thy paternal affection the good knight, Wilfred of Ivanhoe. In this reconciliation thou wilt own I have an interest—thehappiness of my friend, and the quelling of dissension among my faithful people.”“And this is Wilfred!” said Cedric, pointing to his son.“My father!—my father!” said Ivanhoe, prostrating himself at Cedric’s feet, “grant me thy forgiveness!”“Thou hast it, my son,” said Cedric, raising him up. “The son of Hereward knows how to keep his word, even when it has beenpassed to a Norman. But let me see thee use the dress and costume of thy English ancestry—no short cloaks, no gay bonnets, nofantastic plumage in my decent household. He that would be the son of Cedric, must show himself of English ancestry.—Thou artabout to speak,” he added, sternly, “and I guess the topic. The Lady Rowena must complete two years’ mourning, as for a betrothedhusband—all our Saxon ancestors would disown us were we to treat of a new union for her ere the grave of him she should havewedded—him, so much the most worthy of her hand by birth and ancestry—is yet closed. The ghost of Athelstane himself wouldburst his bloody cerements and stand before us to forbid such dishonour to his memory.”It seemed as if Cedric’s words had raised a spectre; for, scarce had he uttered them ere the door ﬂew open, and Athelstane, arrayedin the garments of the grave, stood before them, pale, haggard, and like something arisen from the dead! 59The effect of this apparition on the persons present was utterly appalling. Cedric started back as far as the wall of the apartmentwould permit, and, leaning against it as one unable to support himself, gazed on the ﬁgure of his friend with eyes that seemed ﬁxed,and a mouth which he appeared incapable of shutting. Ivanhoe crossed himself, repeating prayers in Saxon, Latin, or Norman-French,as they occurred to his memory, while Richard alternately said, “Benedicite”, and swore, “Mort de ma vie!”In the meantime, a horrible noise was heard below stairs, some crying, “Secure the treacherous monks!”—others, “Down with theminto the dungeon!”—others, “Pitch them from the highest battlements!”“In the name of God!” said Cedric, addressing what seemed the spectre of his departed friend, “if thou art mortal, speak!—if adeparted spirit, say for what cause thou dost revisit us, or if I can do aught that can set thy spirit at repose.—Living or dead, nobleAthelstane, speak to Cedric!”“I will,” said the spectre, very composedly, “when I have collected breath, and when you give me time—Alive, saidst thou?—I amas much alive as he can be who has fed on bread and water for three days, which seem three ages—Yes, bread and water, FatherCedric! By Heaven, and all saints in it, better food hath not passed my weasand for three livelong days, and by God’s providence it isthat I am now here to tell it.”“Why, noble Athelstane,” said the Black Knight, “I myself saw you struck down by the ﬁerce Templar towards the end of the stormat Torquilstone, and as I thought, and Wamba reported, your skull was cloven through the teeth.”“You thought amiss, Sir Knight,” said Athelstane, “and Wamba lied. My teeth are in good order, and that my supper shall presentlyﬁnd—No thanks to the Templar though, whose sword turned in his hand, so that the blade struck me ﬂatlings, being averted by thehandle of the good mace with which I warded the blow; had my steel-cap been on, I had not valued it a rush, and had dealt him such acounter-buff as would have spoilt his retreat. But as it was, down I went, stunned, indeed, but unwounded. Others, of both sides, werebeaten down and slaughtered above me, so that I never recovered my senses until I found myself in a cofﬁn—(an open one, by goodluck)—placed before the altar of the church of Saint Edmund’s. I sneezed repeatedly—groaned—awakened and would have arisen,when the Sacristan and Abbot, full of terror, came running at the noise, surprised, doubtless, and no way pleased to ﬁnd the man alive,whose heirs they had proposed themselves to be. I asked for wine—they gave me some, but it must have been highly medicated, for Islept yet more deeply than before, and wakened not for many hours. I found my arms swathed down—my feet tied so fast that mineankles ache at the very remembrance—the place was utterly dark—the oubliette, as I suppose, of their accursed convent, and from theclose, stiﬂed, damp smell, I conceive it is also used for a place of sepulture. I had strange thoughts of what had befallen me, when thedoor of my dungeon creaked, and two villain monks entered. They would have persuaded me I was in purgatory, but I knew too wellthe pursy short-breathed voice of the Father Abbot.—Saint Jeremy! how different from that tone with which he used to ask me foranother slice of the haunch!—the dog has feasted with me from Christmas to Twelfth-night.”“Have patience, noble Athelstane,” said the King, “take breath—tell your story at leisure—beshrew me but such a tale is as wellworth listening to as a romance.”“Ay but, by the rood of Bromeholm, there was no romance in the matter!” said Athelstane.—“A barley loaf and a pitcher of water—that THEY gave me, the niggardly traitors, whom my father, and I myself, had enriched, when their best resources were the ﬂitches ofbacon and measures of corn, out of which they wheedled poor serfs and bondsmen, in exchange for their prayers—the nest of foulungrateful vipers—barley bread and ditch water to such a patron as I had been! I will smoke them out of their nest, though I beexcommunicated!”“But, in the name of Our Lady, noble Athelstane,” said Cedric, grasping the hand of his friend, “how didst thou escape thisimminent danger—did their hearts relent?”“Did their hearts relent!” echoed Athelstane.—“Do rocks melt with the sun? I should have been there still, had not some stir in theConvent, which I ﬁnd was their procession hitherward to eat my funeral feast, when they well knew how and where I had been buriedalive, summoned the swarm out of their hive. I heard them droning out their death-psalms, little judging they were sung in respect formy soul by those who were thus famishing my body. They went, however, and I waited long for food—no wonder—the goutySacristan was even too busy with his own provender to mind mine. At length down he came, with an unstable step and a strong ﬂavourof wine and spices about his person. Good cheer had opened his heart, for he left me a nook of pasty and a ﬂask of wine, instead of myformer fare. I ate, drank, and was invigorated; when, to add to my good luck, the Sacristan, too totty to discharge his duty of turnkeyﬁtly, locked the door beside the staple, so that it fell ajar. The light, the food, the wine, set my invention to work. The staple to whichmy chains were ﬁxed, was more rusted than I or the villain Abbot had supposed. Even iron could not remain without consuming in thedamps of that infernal dungeon.”“Take breath, noble Athelstane,” said Richard, “and partake of some refreshment, ere you proceed with a tale so dreadful.”“Partake!” quoth Athelstane; “I have been partaking ﬁve times to-day—and yet a morsel of that savoury ham were not altogetherforeign to the matter; and I pray you, fair sir, to do me reason in a cup of wine.”The guests, though still agape with astonishment, pledged their resuscitated landlord, who thus proceeded in his story:—He hadindeed now many more auditors than those to whom it was commenced, for Edith, having given certain necessary orders for arrangingmatters within the Castle, had followed the dead-alive up to the stranger’s apartment attended by as many of the guests, male andfemale, as could squeeze into the small room, while others, crowding the staircase, caught up an erroneous edition of the story, andtransmitted it still more inaccurately to those beneath, who again sent it forth to the vulgar without, in a fashion totally irreconcilableto the real fact. Athelstane, however, went on as follows, with the history of his escape:—“Finding myself freed from the staple, I dragged myself up stairs as well as a man loaded with shackles, and emaciated with fasting,might; and after much groping about, I was at length directed, by the sound of a jolly roundelay, to the apartment where the worthySacristan, an it so please ye, was holding a devil’s mass with a huge beetle-browed, broad-shouldered brother of the grey-frock andcowl, who looked much more like a thief than a clergyman. I burst in upon them, and the fashion of my grave-clothes, as well as theclanking of my chains, made me more resemble an inhabitant of the other world than of this. Both stood aghast; but when I knockeddown the Sacristan with my ﬁst, the other fellow, his pot-companion, fetched a blow at me with a huge quarter-staff.”“This must be our Friar Tuck, for a count’s ransom,” said Richard, looking at Ivanhoe.“He may be the devil, an he will,” said Athelstane. “Fortunately he missed the aim; and on my approaching to grapple with him,took to his heels and ran for it. I failed not to set my own heels at liberty by means of the fetter-key, which hung amongst others at thesexton’s belt; and I had thoughts of beating out the knave’s brains with the bunch of keys, but gratitude for the nook of pasty and theﬂask of wine which the rascal had imparted to my captivity, came over my heart; so, with a brace of hearty kicks, I left him on theﬂoor, pouched some baked meat, and a leathern bottle of wine, with which the two venerable brethren had been regaling, went to thestable, and found in a private stall mine own best palfrey, which, doubtless, had been set apart for the holy Father Abbot’s particularuse. Hither I came with all the speed the beast could compass—man and mother’s son ﬂying before me wherever I came, taking mefor a spectre, the more especially as, to prevent my being recognised, I drew the corpse-hood over my face. I had not gainedadmittance into my own castle, had I not been supposed to be the attendant of a juggler who is making the people in the castle-yardvery merry, considering they are assembled to celebrate their lord’s funeral—I say the sewer thought I was dressed to bear a part in thetregetour’s mummery, and so I got admission, and did but disclose myself to my mother, and eat a hasty morsel, ere I came in quest ofyou, my noble friend.”“And you have found me,” said Cedric, “ready to resume our brave projects of honour and liberty. I tell thee, never will dawn amorrow so auspicious as the next, for the deliverance of the noble Saxon race.”“Talk not to me of delivering any one,” said Athelstane; “it is well I am delivered myself. I am more intent on punishing that villainAbbot. He shall hang on the top of this Castle of Coningsburgh, in his cope and stole; and if the stairs be too strait to admit his fatcarcass, I will have him craned up from without.”“But, my son,” said Edith, “consider his sacred ofﬁce.”“Consider my three days’ fast,” replied Athelstane; “I will have their blood every one of them. Front-de-Bœuf was burnt alive for aless matter, for he kept a good table for his prisoners, only put too much garlic in his last dish of pottage. But these hypocritical,ungrateful slaves, so often the self-invited ﬂatterers at my board, who gave me neither pottage nor garlic, more or less, they die, by thesoul of Hengist!”“But the Pope, my noble friend,”—said Cedric—“But the devil, my noble friend,”—answered Athelstane; “they die, and no more of them. Were they the best monks upon earth, theworld would go on without them.”“For shame, noble Athelstane,” said Cedric; “forget such wretches in the career of glory which lies open before thee. Tell thisNorman prince, Richard of Anjou, that, lion-hearted as he is, he shall not hold undisputed the throne of Alfred, while a maledescendant of the Holy Confessor lives to dispute it.”“How!” said Athelstane, “is this the noble King Richard?”“It is Richard Plantagenet himself,” said Cedric; “yet I need not remind thee that, coming hither a guest of free-will, he may neitherbe injured nor detained prisoner—thou well knowest thy duty to him as his host.”“Ay, by my faith!” said Athelstane; “and my duty as a subject besides, for I here tender him my allegiance, heart and hand.”“My son,” said Edith, “think on thy royal rights!”“Think on the freedom of England, degenerate Prince!” said Cedric.“Mother and friend,” said Athelstane, “a truce to your upbraidings—bread and water and a dungeon are marvellous mortiﬁers ofambition, and I rise from the tomb a wiser man than I descended into it. One half of those vain follies were puffed into mine ear bythat perﬁdious Abbot Wolfram, and you may now judge if he is a counsellor to be trusted. Since these plots were set in agitation, Ihave had nothing but hurried journeys, indigestions, blows and bruises, imprisonments and starvation; besides that they can only endin the murder of some thousands of quiet folk. I tell you, I will be king in my own domains, and nowhere else; and my ﬁrst act ofdominion shall be to hang the Abbot.”“And my ward Rowena,” said Cedric—“I trust you intend not to desert her?”“Father Cedric,” said Athelstane, “be reasonable. The Lady Rowena cares not for me—she loves the little ﬁnger of my kinsmanWilfred’s glove better than my whole person. There she stands to avouch it—Nay, blush not, kinswoman, there is no shame in loving acourtly knight better than a country franklin—and do not laugh neither, Rowena, for grave-clothes and a thin visage are, God knows,no matter of merriment—Nay, an thou wilt needs laugh, I will ﬁnd thee a better jest—Give me thy hand, or rather lend it me, for I butask it in the way of friendship.—Here, cousin Wilfred of Ivanhoe, in thy favour I renounce and abjure—-Hey! by Saint Dunstan, ourcousin Wilfred hath vanished!—Yet, unless my eyes are still dazzled with the fasting I have undergone, I saw him stand there but evennow.”All now looked around and enquired for Ivanhoe, but he had vanished. It was at length discovered that a Jew had been to seek him;and that, after very brief conference, he had called for Gurth and his armour, and had left the castle.“Fair cousin,” said Athelstane to Rowena, “could I think that this sudden disappearance of Ivanhoe was occasioned by other thanthe weightiest reason, I would myself resume—”But he had no sooner let go her hand, on ﬁrst observing that Ivanhoe had disappeared, than Rowena, who had found her situationextremely embarrassing, had taken the ﬁrst opportunity to escape from the apartment.“Certainly,” quoth Athelstane, “women are the least to be trusted of all animals, monks and abbots excepted. I am an inﬁdel, if Iexpected not thanks from her, and perhaps a kiss to boot—These cursed grave-clothes have surely a spell on them, every one ﬂiesfrom me.—To you I turn, noble King Richard, with the vows of allegiance, which, as a liege-subject—”But King Richard was gone also, and no one knew whither. At length it was learned that he had hastened to the court-yard,summoned to his presence the Jew who had spoken with Ivanhoe, and after a moment’s speech with him, had called vehemently tohorse, thrown himself upon a steed, compelled the Jew to mount another, and set off at a rate, which, according to Wamba, renderedthe old Jew’s neck not worth a penny’s purchase.“By my halidome!” said Athelstane, “it is certain that Zernebock hath possessed himself of my castle in my absence. I return in mygrave-clothes, a pledge restored from the very sepulchre, and every one I speak to vanishes as soon as they hear my voice!—But itskills not talking of it. Come, my friends—such of you as are left, follow me to the banquet-hall, lest any more of us disappear—it is, Itrust, as yet tolerably furnished, as becomes the obsequies of an ancient Saxon noble; and should we tarry any longer, who knows butthe devil may ﬂy off with the supper?”CHAPTER XLIIIBe Mowbray’s sins so heavy in his bosom,That they may break his foaming courser’s back,And throw the rider headlong in the lists,A caitiff recreant!RICHARD IIOur scene now returns to the exterior of the Castle, or Preceptory, of Templestowe, about the hour when the bloody die was to becast for the life or death of Rebecca. It was a scene of bustle and life, as if the whole vicinity had poured forth its inhabitants to avillage wake, or rural feast. But the earnest desire to look on blood and death, is not peculiar to those dark ages; though in thegladiatorial exercise of single combat and general tourney, they were habituated to the bloody spectacle of brave men falling by eachother’s hands. Even in our own days, when morals are better understood, an execution, a bruising match, a riot, or a meeting of radicalreformers, collects, at considerable hazard to themselves, immense crowds of spectators, otherwise little interested, except to see howmatters are to be conducted, or whether the heroes of the day are, in the heroic language of insurgent tailors, ﬂints or dunghills.The eyes, therefore, of a very considerable multitude, were bent on the gate of the Preceptory of Templestowe, with the purpose ofwitnessing the procession; while still greater numbers had already surrounded the tiltyard belonging to that establishment. Thisenclosure was formed on a piece of level ground adjoining to the Preceptory, which had been levelled with care, for the exercise ofmilitary and chivalrous sports. It occupied the brow of a soft and gentle eminence, was carefully palisaded around, and, as theTemplars willingly invited spectators to be witnesses of their skill in feats of chivalry, was amply supplied with galleries and benchesfor their use.On the present occasion, a throne was erected for the Grand Master at the east end, surrounded with seats of distinction for thePreceptors and Knights of the Order. Over these ﬂoated the sacred standard, called “Le Beau-seant”, which was the ensign, as its namewas the battle-cry, of the Templars.At the opposite end of the lists was a pile of faggots, so arranged around a stake, deeply ﬁxed in the ground, as to leave a space forthe victim whom they were destined to consume, to enter within the fatal circle, in order to be chained to the stake by the fetters whichhung ready for that purpose. Beside this deadly apparatus stood four black slaves, whose colour and African features, then so littleknown in England, appalled the multitude, who gazed on them as on demons employed about their own diabolical exercises. Thesemen stirred not, excepting now and then, under the direction of one who seemed their chief, to shift and replace the ready fuel. Theylooked not on the multitude. In fact, they seemed insensible of their presence, and of every thing save the discharge of their ownhorrible duty.And when, in speech with each other, they expanded their blubber lips, and showed their white fangs, as if they grinned at thethoughts of the expected tragedy, the startled commons could scarcely help believing that they were actually the familiar spirits withwhom the witch had communed, and who, her time being out, stood ready to assist in her dreadful punishment. They whispered toeach other, and communicated all the feats which Satan had performed during that busy and unhappy period, not failing, of course, togive the devil rather more than his due.“Have you not heard, Father Dennet,” quoth one boor to another advanced in years, “that the devil has carried away bodily the greatSaxon Thane, Athelstane of Coningsburgh?”“Ay, but he brought him back though, by the blessing of God and Saint Dunstan.”“How’s that?” said a brisk young fellow, dressed in a green cassock embroidered with gold, and having at his heels a stout ladbearing a harp upon his back, which betrayed his vocation. The Minstrel seemed of no vulgar rank; for, besides the splendour of hisgaily braidered doublet, he wore around his neck a silver chain, by which hung the “wrest”, or key, with which he tuned his harp. Onhis right arm was a silver plate, which, instead of bearing, as usual, the cognizance or badge of the baron to whose family he belonged,had barely the word SHERWOOD engraved upon it.—“How mean you by that?” said the gay Minstrel, mingling in the conversationof the peasants; “I came to seek one subject for my rhyme, and, by’r Lady, I were glad to ﬁnd two.”“It is well avouched,” said the elder peasant, “that after Athelstane of Coningsburgh had been dead four weeks—”“That is impossible,” said the Minstrel; “I saw him in life at the Passage of Arms at Ashby-de-la-Zouche.”“Dead, however, he was, or else translated,” said the younger peasant; “for I heard the Monks of Saint Edmund’s singing the death’shymn for him; and, moreover, there was a rich death-meal and dole at the Castle of Coningsburgh, as right was; and thither had I gone,but for Mabel Parkins, who—”“Ay, dead was Athelstane,” said the old man, shaking his head, “and the more pity it was, for the old Saxon blood—”“But, your story, my masters—your story,” said the Minstrel, somewhat impatiently.“Ay, ay—construe us the story,” said a burly Friar, who stood beside them, leaning on a pole that exhibited an appearance between apilgrim’s staff and a quarter-staff, and probably acted as either when occasion served,—“Your story,” said the stalwart churchman;“burn not daylight about it—we have short time to spare.”“An please your reverence,” said Dennet, “a drunken priest came to visit the Sacristan at Saint Edmund’s—-”“It does not please my reverence,” answered the churchman, “that there should be such an animal as a drunken priest, or, if therewere, that a layman should so speak him. Be mannerly, my friend, and conclude the holy man only wrapt in meditation, which makesthe head dizzy and foot unsteady, as if the stomach were ﬁlled with new wine—I have felt it myself.”“Well, then,” answered Father Dennet, “a holy brother came to visit the Sacristan at Saint Edmund’s—a sort of hedge-priest is thevisitor, and kills half the deer that are stolen in the forest, who loves the tinkling of a pint-pot better than the sacring-bell, and deems aﬂitch of bacon worth ten of his breviary; for the rest, a good fellow and a merry, who will ﬂourish a quarter-staff, draw a bow, anddance a Cheshire round, with e’er a man in Yorkshire.”“That last part of thy speech, Dennet,” said the Minstrel, “has saved thee a rib or twain.”“Tush, man, I fear him not,” said Dennet; “I am somewhat old and stiff, but when I fought for the bell and ram at Doncaster—”“But the story—the story, my friend,” again said the Minstrel.“Why, the tale is but this—Athelstane of Coningsburgh was buried at Saint Edmund’s.”“That’s a lie, and a loud one,” said the Friar, “for I saw him borne to his own Castle of Coningsburgh.”“Nay, then, e’en tell the story yourself, my masters,” said Dennet, turning sulky at these repeated contradictions; and it was withsome difﬁculty that the boor could be prevailed on, by the request of his comrade and the Minstrel, to renew his tale.—“These two‘sober’ friars,” said he at length, “since this reverend man will needs have them such, had continued drinking good ale, and wine, andwhat not, for the best part for a summer’s day, when they were aroused by a deep groan, and a clanking of chains, and the ﬁgure of thedeceased Athelstane entered the apartment, saying, ‘Ye evil shep-herds!—’”“It is false,” said the Friar, hastily, “he never spoke a word.”“So ho! Friar Tuck,” said the Minstrel, drawing him apart from the rustics; “we have started a new hare, I ﬁnd.”“I tell thee, Allan-a-Dale,” said the Hermit, “I saw Athelstane of Coningsburgh as much as bodily eyes ever saw a living man. Hehad his shroud on, and all about him smelt of the sepulchre—A butt of sack will not wash it out of my memory.”“Pshaw!” answered the Minstrel; “thou dost but jest with me!”“Never believe me,” said the Friar, “an I fetched not a knock at him with my quarter-staff that would have felled an ox, and it glidedthrough his body as it might through a pillar of smoke!”“By Saint Hubert,” said the Minstrel, “but it is a wondrous tale, and ﬁt to be put in metre to the ancient tune, ‘Sorrow came to theold Friar.’”“Laugh, if ye list,” said Friar Tuck; “but an ye catch me singing on such a theme, may the next ghost or devil carry me off with himheadlong! No, no—I instantly formed the purpose of assisting at some good work, such as the burning of a witch, a judicial combat, orthe like matter of godly service, and therefore am I here.”As they thus conversed, the heavy bell of the church of Saint Michael of Templestowe, a venerable building, situated in a hamlet atsome distance from the Preceptory, broke short their argument. One by one the sullen sounds fell successively on the ear, leaving butsufﬁcient space for each to die away in distant echo, ere the air was again ﬁlled by repetition of the iron knell. These sounds, the signalof the approaching ceremony, chilled with awe the hearts of the assembled multitude, whose eyes were now turned to the Preceptory,expecting the approach of the Grand Master, the champion, and the criminal.At length the drawbridge fell, the gates opened, and a knight, bearing the great standard of the Order, sallied from the castle,preceded by six trumpets, and followed by the Knights Preceptors, two and two, the Grand Master coming last, mounted on a statelyhorse, whose furniture was of the simplest kind. Behind him came Brian de Bois-Guilbert, armed cap-a-pie in bright armour, butwithout his lance, shield, and sword, which were borne by his two esquires behind him. His face, though partly hidden by a longplume which ﬂoated down from his barrel-cap, bore a strong and mingled expression of passion, in which pride seemed to contendwith irresolution. He looked ghastly pale, as if he had not slept for several nights, yet reined his pawing war-horse with the habitualease and grace proper to the best lance of the Order of the Temple. His general appearance was grand and commanding; but, looking athim with attention, men read that in his dark features, from which they willingly withdrew their eyes.On either side rode Conrade of Mont-Fitchet, and Albert de Malvoisin, who acted as godfathers to the champion. They were in theirrobes of peace, the white dress of the Order. Behind them followed other Companions of the Temple, with a long train of esquires andpages clad in black, aspirants to the honour of being one day Knights of the Order. After these neophytes came a guard of warders onfoot, in the same sable livery, amidst whose partisans might be seen the pale form of the accused, moving with a slow but undismayedstep towards the scene of her fate. She was stript of all her ornaments, lest perchance there should be among them some of thoseamulets which Satan was supposed to bestow upon his victims, to deprive them of the power of confession even when under thetorture. A coarse white dress, of the simplest form, had been substituted for her Oriental garments; yet there was such an exquisitemixture of courage and resignation in her look, that even in this garb, and with no other ornament than her long black tresses, each eyewept that looked upon her, and the most hardened bigot regretted the fate that had converted a creature so goodly into a vessel ofwrath, and a waged slave of the devil.A crowd of inferior personages belonging to the Preceptory followed the victim, all moving with the utmost order, with arms folded,and looks bent upon the ground.This slow procession moved up the gentle eminence, on the summit of which was the tiltyard, and, entering the lists, marched oncearound them from right to left, and when they had completed the circle, made a halt. There was then a momentary bustle, while theGrand Master and all his attendants, excepting the champion and his godfathers, dismounted from their horses, which wereimmediately removed out of the lists by the esquires, who were in attendance for that purpose.The unfortunate Rebecca was conducted to the black chair placed near the pile. On her ﬁrst glance at the terrible spot wherepreparations were making for a death alike dismaying to the mind and painful to the body, she was observed to shudder and shut hereyes, praying internally doubtless, for her lips moved though no speech was heard. In the space of a minute she opened her eyes,looked ﬁxedly on the pile as if to familiarize her mind with the object, and then slowly and naturally turned away her head.Meanwhile, the Grand Master had assumed his seat; and when the chivalry of his order was placed around and behind him, each inhis due rank, a loud and long ﬂourish of the trumpets announced that the Court were seated for judgment. Malvoisin, then, acting asgodfather of the champion, stepped forward, and laid the glove of the Jewess, which was the pledge of battle, at the feet of the GrandMaster.“Valorous Lord, and reverend Father,” said he, “here standeth the good Knight, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, Knight Preceptor of theOrder of the Temple, who, by accepting the pledge of battle which I now lay at your reverence’s feet, hath become bound to do hisdevoir in combat this day, to maintain that this Jewish maiden, by name Rebecca, hath justly deserved the doom passed upon her in aChapter of this most Holy Order of the Temple of Zion, condemning her to die as a sorceress;—here, I say, he standeth, such battle todo, knightly and honourable, if such be your noble and sanctiﬁed pleasure.”“Hath he made oath,” said the Grand Master, “that his quarrel is just and honourable? Bring forward the Cruciﬁx and the ‘Teigitur’.”“Sir, and most reverend father,” answered Malvoisin, readily, “our brother here present hath already sworn to the truth of hisaccusation in the hand of the good Knight Conrade de Mont-Fitchet; and otherwise he ought not to be sworn, seeing that his adversaryis an unbeliever, and may take no oath.”This explanation was satisfactory, to Albert’s great joy; for the wily knight had foreseen the great difﬁculty, or rather impossibility,of prevailing upon Brian de Bois-Guilbert to take such an oath before the assembly, and had invented this excuse to escape thenecessity of his doing so.The Grand Master, having allowed the apology of Albert Malvoisin, commanded the herald to stand forth and do his devoir. Thetrumpets then again ﬂourished, and a herald, stepping forward, proclaimed aloud,—“Oyez, oyez, oyez.—Here standeth the goodKnight, Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert, ready to do battle with any knight of free blood, who will sustain the quarrel allowed and allottedto the Jewess Rebecca, to try by champion, in respect of lawful essoine of her own body; and to such champion the reverend andvalorous Grand Master here present allows a fair ﬁeld, and equal partition of sun and wind, and whatever else appertains to a faircombat.” The trumpets again sounded, and there was a dead pause of many minutes.“No champion appears for the appellant,” said the Grand Master. “Go, herald, and ask her whether she expects any one to do battlefor her in this her cause.” The herald went to the chair in which Rebecca was seated, and Bois-Guilbert suddenly turning his horse’shead toward that end of the lists, in spite of hints on either side from Malvoisin and Mont-Fitchet, was by the side of Rebecca’s chairas soon as the herald.“Is this regular, and according to the law of combat?” said Malvoisin, looking to the Grand Master.“Albert de Malvoisin, it is,” answered Beaumanoir; “for in this appeal to the judgment of God, we may not prohibit parties fromhaving that communication with each other, which may best tend to bring forth the truth of the quarrel.”In the meantime, the herald spoke to Rebecca in these terms:—“Damsel, the Honourable and Reverend the Grand Master demandsof thee, if thou art prepared with a champion to do battle this day in thy behalf, or if thou dost yield thee as one justly condemned to adeserved doom?”“Say to the Grand Master,” replied Rebecca, “that I maintain my innocence, and do not yield me as justly condemned, lest I becomeguilty of mine own blood. Say to him, that I challenge such delay as his forms will permit, to see if God, whose opportunity is inman’s extremity, will raise me up a deliverer; and when such uttermost space is passed, may His holy will be done!” The herald retiredto carry this answer to the Grand Master.“God forbid,” said Lucas Beaumanoir, “that Jew or Pagan should impeach us of injustice!—Until the shadows be cast from the westto the eastward, will we wait to see if a champion shall appear for this unfortunate woman. When the day is so far passed, let herprepare for death.”The herald communicated the words of the Grand Master to Rebecca, who bowed her head submissively, folded her arms, and,looking up towards heaven, seemed to expect that aid from above which she could scarce promise herself from man. During this awfulpause, the voice of Bois-Guilbert broke upon her ear—it was but a whisper, yet it startled her more than the summons of the heraldhad appeared to do.“Rebecca,” said the Templar, “dost thou hear me?”“I have no portion in thee, cruel, hard-hearted man,” said the unfortunate maiden.“Ay, but dost thou understand my words?” said the Templar; “for the sound of my voice is frightful in mine own ears. I scarce knowon what ground we stand, or for what purpose they have brought us hither.—This listed space—that chair—these faggots—I knowtheir purpose, and yet it appears to me like something unreal—the fearful picture of a vision, which appals my sense with hideousfantasies, but convinces not my reason.”“My mind and senses keep touch and time,” answered Rebecca, “and tell me alike that these faggots are destined to consume myearthly body, and open a painful but a brief passage to a better world.”“Dreams, Rebecca,—dreams,” answered the Templar; “idle visions, rejected by the wisdom of your own wiser Sadducees. Hear me,Rebecca,” he said, proceeding with animation; “a better chance hast thou for life and liberty than yonder knaves and dotard dream of.Mount thee behind me on my steed—on Zamor, the gallant horse that never failed his rider. I won him in single ﬁght from the Soldanof Trebizond—mount, I say, behind me—in one short hour is pursuit and enquiry far behind—a new world of pleasure opens to thee—to me a new career of fame. Let them speak the doom which I despise, and erase the name of Bois-Guilbert from their list of monasticslaves! I will wash out with blood whatever blot they may dare to cast on my scutcheon.”
“Tempter,” said Rebecca, “begone!—Not in this last extremity canst thou move me one hair’s-breadth from my resting place—surrounded as I am by foes, I hold thee as my worst and most deadly enemy—avoid thee, in the name of God!”Albert Malvoisin, alarmed and impatient at the duration of their conference, now advanced to interrupt it.“Hath the maiden acknowledged her guilt?” he demanded of Bois-Guilbert; “or is she resolute in her denial?”“She is indeed resolute,” said Bois-Guilbert.“Then,” said Malvoisin, “must thou, noble brother, resume thy place to attend the issue—The shades are changing on the circle ofthe dial—Come, brave Bois-Guilbert—come, thou hope of our holy Order, and soon to be its head.”As he spoke in this soothing tone, he laid his hand on the knight’s bridle, as if to lead him back to his station.“False villain! what meanest thou by thy hand on my rein?” said Sir Brian, angrily. And shaking off his companion’s grasp, he rodeback to the upper end of the lists.“There is yet spirit in him,” said Malvoisin apart to Mont-Fitchet, “were it well directed—but, like the Greek ﬁre, it burns whateverapproaches it.”The Judges had now been two hours in the lists, awaiting in vain the appearance of a champion.“And reason good,” said Friar Tuck, “seeing she is a Jewess—and yet, by mine Order, it is hard that so young and beautiful acreature should perish without one blow being struck in her behalf! Were she ten times a witch, provided she were but the least bit of aChristian, my quarter-staff should ring noon on the steel cap of yonder ﬁerce Templar, ere he carried the matter off thus.”It was, however, the general belief that no one could or would appear for a Jewess, accused of sorcery; and the knights, instigatedby Malvoisin, whispered to each other, that it was time to declare the pledge of Rebecca forfeited. At this instant a knight, urging hishorse to speed, appeared on the plain advancing towards the lists. A hundred voices exclaimed, “A champion! a champion!” Anddespite the prepossessions and prejudices of the multitude, they shouted unanimously as the knight rode into the tiltyard. The seconddespite the prepossessions and prejudices of the multitude, they shouted unanimously as the knight rode into the tiltyard. The secondglance, however, served to destroy the hope that his timely arrival had excited. His horse, urged for many miles to its utmost speed,appeared to reel from fatigue, and the rider, however undauntedly he presented himself in the lists, either from weakness, weariness, orboth, seemed scarce able to support himself in the saddle.To the summons of the herald, who demanded his rank, his name, and purpose, the stranger knight answered readily and boldly, “Iam a good knight and noble, come hither to sustain with lance and sword the just and lawful quarrel of this damsel, Rebecca, daughterof Isaac of York; to uphold the doom pronounced against her to be false and truthless, and to defy Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert, as atraitor, murderer, and liar; as I will prove in this ﬁeld with my body against his, by the aid of God, of Our Lady, and of MonseigneurSaint George, the good knight.”“The stranger must ﬁrst show,” said Malvoisin, “that he is good knight, and of honourable lineage. The Temple sendeth not forth herchampions against nameless men.”“My name,” said the Knight, raising his helmet, “is better known, my lineage more pure, Malvoisin, than thine own. I am Wilfred ofIvanhoe.”“I will not ﬁght with thee at present,” said the Templar, in a changed and hollow voice. “Get thy wounds healed, purvey thee abetter horse, and it may be I will hold it worth my while to scourge out of thee this boyish spirit of bravado.”“Ha! proud Templar,” said Ivanhoe, “hast thou forgotten that twice didst thou fall before this lance? Remember the lists at Acre—remember the Passage of Arms at Ashby—remember thy proud vaunt in the halls of Rotherwood, and the gage of your gold chainagainst my reliquary, that thou wouldst do battle with Wilfred of Ivanhoe, and recover the honour thou hadst lost! By that reliquaryand the holy relic it contains, I will proclaim thee, Templar, a coward in every court in Europe—in every Preceptory of thine Order—unless thou do battle without farther delay.”Bois-Guilbert turned his countenance irresolutely towards Rebecca, and then exclaimed, looking ﬁercely at Ivanhoe, “Dog of aSaxon! take thy lance, and prepare for the death thou hast drawn upon thee!”“Does the Grand Master allow me the combat?” said Ivanhoe.“I may not deny what thou hast challenged,” said the Grand Master, “provided the maiden accepts thee as her champion. Yet Iwould thou wert in better plight to do battle. An enemy of our Order hast thou ever been, yet would I have thee honourably met with.”“Thus—thus as I am, and not otherwise,” said Ivanhoe; “it is the judgment of God—to his keeping I commend myself.—Rebecca,”said he, riding up to the fatal chair, “dost thou accept of me for thy champion?”“I do,” she said—“I do,” ﬂuttered by an emotion which the fear of death had been unable to produce, “I do accept thee as thechampion whom Heaven hath sent me. Yet, no—no—thy wounds are uncured—Meet not that proud man—why shouldst thou perishalso?”But Ivanhoe was already at his post, and had closed his visor, and assumed his lance. Bois-Guilbert did the same; and his esquireremarked, as he clasped his visor, that his face, which had, notwithstanding the variety of emotions by which he had been agitated,continued during the whole morning of an ashy paleness, was now become suddenly very much ﬂushed.The herald, then, seeing each champion in his place, uplifted his voice, repeating thrice—“Faites vos devoirs, preux chevaliers!”After the third cry, he withdrew to one side of the lists, and again proclaimed, that none, on peril of instant death, should dare, byword, cry, or action, to interfere with or disturb this fair ﬁeld of combat. The Grand Master, who held in his hand the gage of battle,Rebecca’s glove, now threw it into the lists, and pronounced the fatal signal words, “Laissez aller”.The trumpets sounded, and the knights charged each other in full career. The wearied horse of Ivanhoe, and its no less exhaustedrider, went down, as all had expected, before the well-aimed lance and vigorous steed of the Templar. This issue of the combat all hadforeseen; but although the spear of Ivanhoe did but, in comparison, touch the shield of Bois-Guilbert, that champion, to theastonishment of all who beheld it reeled in his saddle, lost his stirrups, and fell in the lists.Ivanhoe, extricating himself from his fallen horse, was soon on foot, hastening to mend his fortune with his sword; but hisantagonist arose not. Wilfred, placing his foot on his breast, and the sword’s point to his throat, commanded him to yield him, or dieon the spot. Bois-Guilbert returned no answer.“Slay him not, Sir Knight,” cried the Grand Master, “unshriven and unabsolved—kill not body and soul! We allow himvanquished.”He descended into the lists, and commanded them to unhelm the conquered champion. His eyes were closed—the dark red ﬂushwas still on his brow. As they looked on him in astonishment, the eyes opened—but they were ﬁxed and glazed. The ﬂush passed fromhis brow, and gave way to the pallid hue of death. Unscathed by the lance of his enemy, he had died a victim to the violence of his owncontending passions.“This is indeed the judgment of God,” said the Grand Master, looking upwards—“‘Fiat voluntas tua!’”CHAPTER XLIVSo! now ’tis ended, like an old wife’s story.WEBSTERWhen the ﬁrst moments of surprise were over, Wilfred of Ivanhoe demanded of the Grand Master, as judge of the ﬁeld, if he hadmanfully and rightfully done his duty in the combat? “Manfully and rightfully hath it been done,” said the Grand Master. “I pronouncethe maiden free and guiltless—The arms and the body of the deceased knight are at the will of the victor.”“I will not despoil him of his weapons,” said the Knight of Ivanhoe, “nor condemn his corpse to shame—he hath fought forChristendom—God’s arm, no human hand, hath this day struck him down. But let his obsequies be private, as becomes those of a manwho died in an unjust quarrel.—And for the maiden—”He was interrupted by a clattering of horses’ feet, advancing in such numbers, and so rapidly, as to shake the ground before them;and the Black Knight galloped into the lists. He was followed by a numerous band of men-at-arms, and several knights in completearmour.“I am too late,” he said, looking around him. “I had doomed Bois-Guilbert for mine own property.—Ivanhoe, was this well, to takeon thee such a venture, and thou scarce able to keep thy saddle?”“Heaven, my Liege,” answered Ivanhoe, “hath taken this proud man for its victim. He was not to be honoured in dying as your willhad designed.”“Peace be with him,” said Richard, looking steadfastly on the corpse, “if it may be so—he was a gallant knight, and has died in hissteel harness full knightly. But we must waste no time—Bohun, do thine ofﬁce!”A Knight stepped forward from the King’s attendants, and, laying his hand on the shoulder of Albert de Malvoisin, said, “I arrestthee of High Treason.”The Grand Master had hitherto stood astonished at the appearance of so many warriors.—He now spoke.“Who dares to arrest a Knight of the Temple of Zion, within the girth of his own Preceptory, and in the presence of the GrandMaster? and by whose authority is this bold outrage offered?”“I make the arrest,” replied the Knight—“I, Henry Bohun, Earl of Essex, Lord High Constable of England.”“And he arrests Malvoisin,” said the King, raising his visor, “by the order of Richard Plantagenet, here present.—Conrade Mont-Fitchet, it is well for thee thou art born no subject of mine.—But for thee, Malvoisin, thou diest with thy brother Philip, ere the worldbe a week older.”“I will resist thy doom,” said the Grand Master.“Proud Templar,” said the King, “thou canst not—look up, and behold the Royal Standard of England ﬂoats over thy towers insteadof thy Temple banner!—Be wise, Beaumanoir, and make no bootless opposition—Thy hand is in the lion’s mouth.”“I will appeal to Rome against thee,” said the Grand Master, “for usurpation on the immunities and privileges of our Order.”“Be it so,” said the King; “but for thine own sake tax me not with usurpation now. Dissolve thy Chapter, and depart with thyfollowers to thy next Preceptory, (if thou canst ﬁnd one), which has not been made the scene of treasonable conspiracy against theKing of England—Or, if thou wilt, remain, to share our hospitality, and behold our justice.”“To be a guest in the house where I should command?” said the Templar; “never!—Chaplains, raise the Psalm, ‘Quare fremueruntGentes?’—Knights, squires, and followers of the Holy Temple, prepare to follow the banner of ‘Beau-seant!’”The Grand Master spoke with a dignity which confronted even that of England’s king himself, and inspired courage into hissurprised and dismayed followers. They gathered around him like the sheep around the watch-dog, when they hear the baying of thewolf. But they evinced not the timidity of the scared ﬂock—there were dark brows of deﬁance, and looks which menaced the hostilitythey dared not to proffer in words. They drew together in a dark line of spears, from which the white cloaks of the knights were visibleamong the dusky garments of their retainers, like the lighter-coloured edges of a sable cloud. The multitude, who had raised aclamorous shout of reprobation, paused and gazed in silence on the formidable and experienced body to which they had unwarily badedeﬁance, and shrunk back from their front.The Earl of Essex, when he beheld them pause in their assembled force, dashed the rowels into his charger’s sides, and gallopedbackwards and forwards to array his followers, in opposition to a band so formidable. Richard alone, as if he loved the danger hispresence had provoked, rode slowly along the front of the Templars, calling aloud, “What, sirs! Among so many gallant knights, willnone dare splinter a spear with Richard?—Sirs of the Temple! your ladies are but sun-burned, if they are not worth the shiver of abroken lance?”“The Brethren of the Temple,” said the Grand Master, riding forward in advance of their body, “ﬁght not on such idle and profanequarrel—and not with thee, Richard of England, shall a Templar cross lance in my presence. The Pope and Princes of Europe shalljudge our quarrel, and whether a Christian prince has done well in bucklering the cause which thou hast to-day adopted. If unassailed,we depart assailing no one. To thine honour we refer the armour and household goods of the Order which we leave behind us, and onthy conscience we lay the scandal and offence thou hast this day given to Christendom.”With these words, and without waiting a reply, the Grand Master gave the signal of departure. Their trumpets sounded a wild march,of an Oriental character, which formed the usual signal for the Templars to advance. They changed their array from a line to a columnof march, and moved off as slowly as their horses could step, as if to show it was only the will of their Grand Master, and no fear ofthe opposing and superior force, which compelled them to withdraw.“By the splendour of Our Lady’s brow!” said King Richard, “it is pity of their lives that these Templars are not so trusty as they aredisciplined and valiant.”The multitude, like a timid cur which waits to bark till the object of its challenge has turned his back, raised a feeble shout as therear of the squadron left the ground.During the tumult which attended the retreat of the Templars, Rebecca saw and heard nothing—she was locked in the arms of heraged father, giddy, and almost senseless, with the rapid change of circumstances around her. But one word from Isaac at lengthrecalled her scattered feelings.“Let us go,” he said, “my dear daughter, my recovered treasure—let us go to throw ourselves at the feet of the good youth.”“Not so,” said Rebecca, “O no—no—no—I must not at this moment dare to speak to him—Alas! I should say more than—No, myfather, let us instantly leave this evil place.”“But, my daughter,” said Isaac, “to leave him who hath come forth like a strong man with his spear and shield, holding his life asnothing, so he might redeem thy captivity; and thou, too, the daughter of a people strange unto him and his—this is service to bethankfully acknowledged.”“It is—it is—most thankfully—most devoutly acknowledged,” said Rebecca—“it shall be still more so—but not now—for the sakeof thy beloved Rachel, father, grant my request—not now!”“Nay, but,” said Isaac, insisting, “they will deem us more thankless than mere dogs!”“But thou seest, my dear father, that King Richard is in presence, and that—-”“True, my best—my wisest Rebecca!—Let us hence—let us hence!—Money he will lack, for he has just returned from Palestine,and, as they say, from prison—and pretext for exacting it, should he need any, may arise out of my simple trafﬁc with his brother John.Away, away, let us hence!”And hurrying his daughter in his turn, he conducted her from the lists, and by means of conveyance which he had provided,transported her safely to the house of the Rabbi Nathan.The Jewess, whose fortunes had formed the principal interest of the day, having now retired unobserved, the attention of thepopulace was transferred to the Black Knight. They now ﬁlled the air with “Long life to Richard with the Lion’s Heart, and down withthe usurping Templars!”“Notwithstanding all this lip-loyalty,” said Ivanhoe to the Earl of Essex, “it was well the King took the precaution to bring thee withhim, noble Earl, and so many of thy trusty followers.”The Earl smiled and shook his head.“Gallant Ivanhoe,” said Essex, “dost thou know our Master so well, and yet suspect him of taking so wise a precaution! I wasdrawing towards York having heard that Prince John was making head there, when I met King Richard, like a true knight-errant,galloping hither to achieve in his own person this adventure of the Templar and the Jewess, with his own single arm. I accompaniedhim with my band, almost maugre his consent.”“And what news from York, brave Earl?” said Ivanhoe; “will the rebels bide us there?”“No more than December’s snow will bide July’s sun,” said the Earl; “they are dispersing; and who should come posting to bring usthe news, but John himself!”“The traitor! the ungrateful insolent traitor!” said Ivanhoe; “did not Richard order him into conﬁnement?”“O! he received him,” answered the Earl, “as if they had met after a hunting party; and, pointing to me and our men-at-arms, said,‘Thou seest, brother, I have some angry men with me—thou wert best go to our mother, carry her my duteous affection, and abidewith her until men’s minds are paciﬁed.’”“And this was all he said?” enquired Ivanhoe; “would not any one say that this Prince invites men to treason by his clemency?”“Just,” replied the Earl, “as the man may be said to invite death, who undertakes to ﬁght a combat, having a dangerous woundunhealed.”“I forgive thee the jest, Lord Earl,” said Ivanhoe; “but, remember, I hazarded but my own life—Richard, the welfare of hiskingdom.”“Those,” replied Essex, “who are specially careless of their own welfare, are seldom remarkably attentive to that of others—But letus haste to the castle, for Richard meditates punishing some of the subordinate members of the conspiracy, though he has pardonedtheir principal.”From the judicial investigations which followed on this occasion, and which are given at length in the Wardour Manuscript, itappears that Maurice de Bracy escaped beyond seas, and went into the service of Philip of France; while Philip de Malvoisin, and hisbrother Albert, the Preceptor of Templestowe, were executed, although Waldemar Fitzurse, the soul of the conspiracy, escaped withbanishment; and Prince John, for whose behoof it was undertaken, was not even censured by his good-natured brother. No one,however, pitied the fate of the two Malvoisins, who only suffered the death which they had both well deserved, by many acts offalsehood, cruelty, and oppression.Brieﬂy after the judicial combat, Cedric the Saxon was summoned to the court of Richard, which, for the purpose of quieting thecounties that had been disturbed by the ambition of his brother, was then held at York. Cedric tushed and pshawed more than once atthe message—but he refused not obedience. In fact, the return of Richard had quenched every hope that he had entertained of restoringa Saxon dynasty in England; for, whatever head the Saxons might have made in the event of a civil war, it was plain that nothing couldbe done under the undisputed dominion of Richard, popular as he was by his personal good qualities and military fame, although hisadministration was wilfully careless, now too indulgent, and now allied to despotism.But, moreover, it could not escape even Cedric’s reluctant observation, that his project for an absolute union among the Saxons, bythe marriage of Rowena and Athelstane, was now completely at an end, by the mutual dissent of both parties concerned. This was,indeed, an event which, in his ardour for the Saxon cause, he could not have anticipated, and even when the disinclination of both wasbroadly and plainly manifested, he could scarce bring himself to believe that two Saxons of royal descent should scruple, on personalgrounds, at an alliance so necessary for the public weal of the nation. But it was not the less certain: Rowena had always expressed herrepugnance to Athelstane, and now Athelstane was no less plain and positive in proclaiming his resolution never to pursue hisaddresses to the Lady Rowena. Even the natural obstinacy of Cedric sunk beneath these obstacles, where he, remaining on the point ofjunction, had the task of dragging a reluctant pair up to it, one with each hand. He made, however, a last vigorous attack on Athelstane,and he found that resuscitated sprout of Saxon royalty engaged, like country squires of our own day, in a furious war with the clergy.It seems that, after all his deadly menaces against the Abbot of Saint Edmund’s, Athelstane’s spirit of revenge, what between thenatural indolent kindness of his own disposition, what through the prayers of his mother Edith, attached, like most ladies, (of theperiod,) to the clerical order, had terminated in his keeping the Abbot and his monks in the dungeons of Coningsburgh for three dayson a meagre diet. For this atrocity the Abbot menaced him with excommunication, and made out a dreadful list of complaints in thebowels and stomach, suffered by himself and his monks, in consequence of the tyrannical and unjust imprisonment they had sustained.With this controversy, and with the means he had adopted to counteract this clerical persecution, Cedric found the mind of his friendAthelstane so fully occupied, that it had no room for another idea. And when Rowena’s name was mentioned the noble Athelstaneprayed leave to quaff a full goblet to her health, and that she might soon be the bride of his kinsman Wilfred. It was a desperate casetherefore. There was obviously no more to be made of Athelstane; or, as Wamba expressed it, in a phrase which has descended fromSaxon times to ours, he was a cock that would not ﬁght.There remained betwixt Cedric and the determination which the lovers desired to come to, only two obstacles—his own obstinacy,and his dislike of the Norman dynasty. The former feeling gradually gave way before the endearments of his ward, and the pridewhich he could not help nourishing in the fame of his son. Besides, he was not insensible to the honour of allying his own line to thatof Alfred, when the superior claims of the descendant of Edward the Confessor were abandoned for ever. Cedric’s aversion to theNorman race of kings was also much undermined,—ﬁrst, by consideration of the impossibility of ridding England of the new dynasty,a feeling which goes far to create loyalty in the subject to the king “de facto”; and, secondly, by the personal attention of KingRichard, who delighted in the blunt humour of Cedric, and, to use the language of the Wardour Manuscript, so dealt with the nobleSaxon, that, ere he had been a guest at court for seven days, he had given his consent to the marriage of his ward Rowena and his sonWilfred of Ivanhoe.The nuptials of our hero, thus formally approved by his father, were celebrated in the most august of temples, the noble Minster ofYork. The King himself attended, and from the countenance which he afforded on this and other occasions to the distressed andhitherto degraded Saxons, gave them a safer and more certain prospect of attaining their just rights, than they could reasonably hopefrom the precarious chance of a civil war. The Church gave her full solemnities, graced with all the splendour which she of Romeknows how to apply with such brilliant effect.Gurth, gallantly apparelled, attended as esquire upon his young master whom he had served so faithfully, and the magnanimousWamba, decorated with a new cap and a most gorgeous set of silver bells. Sharers of Wilfred’s dangers and adversity, they remained,as they had a right to expect, the partakers of his more prosperous career.But besides this domestic retinue, these distinguished nuptials were celebrated by the attendance of the high-born Normans, as wellas Saxons, joined with the universal jubilee of the lower orders, that marked the marriage of two individuals as a pledge of the futurepeace and harmony betwixt two races, which, since that period, have been so completely mingled, that the distinction has becomewholly invisible. Cedric lived to see this union approximate towards its completion; for as the two nations mixed in society andformed intermarriages with each other, the Normans abated their scorn, and the Saxons were reﬁned from their rusticity. But it was notuntil the reign of Edward the Third that the mixed language, now termed English, was spoken at the court of London, and that thehostile distinction of Norman and Saxon seems entirely to have disappeared.It was upon the second morning after this happy bridal, that the Lady Rowena was made acquainted by her handmaid Elgitha, that adamsel desired admission to her presence, and solicited that their parley might be without witness. Rowena wondered, hesitated,became curious, and ended by commanding the damsel to be admitted, and her attendants to withdraw.She entered—a noble and commanding ﬁgure, the long white veil, in which she was shrouded, overshadowing rather thanconcealing the elegance and majesty of her shape. Her demeanour was that of respect, unmingled by the least shade either of fear, orof a wish to propitiate favour. Rowena was ever ready to acknowledge the claims, and attend to the feelings, of others. She arose, andwould have conducted her lovely visitor to a seat; but the stranger looked at Elgitha, and again intimated a wish to discourse with theLady Rowena alone. Elgitha had no sooner retired with unwilling steps, than, to the surprise of the Lady of Ivanhoe, her fair visitantkneeled on one knee, pressed her hands to her forehead, and bending her head to the ground, in spite of Rowena’s resistance, kissedthe embroidered hem of her tunic.
“What means this, lady?” said the surprised bride; “or why do you offer to me a deference so unusual?”“Because to you, Lady of Ivanhoe,” said Rebecca, rising up and resuming the usual quiet dignity of her manner, “I may lawfully,and without rebuke, pay the debt of gratitude which I owe to Wilfred of Ivanhoe. I am—forgive the boldness which has offered to youthe homage of my country—I am the unhappy Jewess, for whom your husband hazarded his life against such fearful odds in thetiltyard of Templestowe.”“Damsel,” said Rowena, “Wilfred of Ivanhoe on that day rendered back but in slight measure your unceasing charity towards him inhis wounds and misfortunes. Speak, is there aught remains in which he or I can serve thee?”“Nothing,” said Rebecca, calmly, “unless you will transmit to him my grateful farewell.”“You leave England then?” said Rowena, scarce recovering the surprise of this extraordinary visit.“I leave it, lady, ere this moon again changes. My father had a brother high in favour with Mohammed Boabdil, King of Grenada—thither we go, secure of peace and protection, for the payment of such ransom as the Moslem exact from our people.”“And are you not then as well protected in England?” said Rowena. “My husband has favour with the King—the King himself isjust and generous.”“Lady,” said Rebecca, “I doubt it not—but the people of England are a ﬁerce race, quarrelling ever with their neighbours or amongthemselves, and ready to plunge the sword into the bowels of each other. Such is no safe abode for the children of my people. Ephraimis an heartless dove—Issachar an over-laboured drudge, which stoops between two burdens. Not in a land of war and blood,surrounded by hostile neighbours, and distracted by internal factions, can Israel hope to rest during her wanderings.”“But you, maiden,” said Rowena—“you surely can have nothing to fear. She who nursed the sick-bed of Ivanhoe,” she continued,rising with enthusiasm—“she can have nothing to fear in England, where Saxon and Norman will contend who shall most do herhonour.”“Thy speech is fair, lady,” said Rebecca, “and thy purpose fairer; but it may not be—there is a gulf betwixt us. Our breeding, ourfaith, alike forbid either to pass over it. Farewell—yet, ere I go indulge me one request. The bridal-veil hangs over thy face; deign toraise it, and let me see the features of which fame speaks so highly.”“They are scarce worthy of being looked upon,” said Rowena; “but, expecting the same from my visitant, I remove the veil.”She took it off accordingly; and, partly from the consciousness of beauty, partly from bashfulness, she blushed so intensely, thatcheek, brow, neck, and bosom, were suffused with crimson. Rebecca blushed also, but it was a momentary feeling; and, mastered byhigher emotions, past slowly from her features like the crimson cloud, which changes colour when the sun sinks beneath the horizon.“Lady,” she said, “the countenance you have deigned to show me will long dwell in my remembrance. There reigns in it gentlenessand goodness; and if a tinge of the world’s pride or vanities may mix with an expression so lovely, how should we chide that which isof earth for bearing some colour of its original? Long, long will I remember your features, and bless God that I leave my nobledeliverer united with—”She stopped short—her eyes ﬁlled with tears. She hastily wiped them, and answered to the anxious enquiries of Rowena—“I amwell, lady—well. But my heart swells when I think of Torquilstone and the lists of Templestowe.—Farewell. One, the most triﬂingpart of my duty, remains undischarged. Accept this casket—startle not at its contents.”Rowena opened the small silver-chased casket, and perceived a carcanet, or neck lace, with ear-jewels, of diamonds, which wereobviously of immense value.“It is impossible,” she said, tendering back the casket. “I dare not accept a gift of such consequence.”“Yet keep it, lady,” returned Rebecca.—“You have power, rank, command, inﬂuence; we have wealth, the source both of ourstrength and weakness; the value of these toys, ten times multiplied, would not inﬂuence half so much as your slightest wish. To you,therefore, the gift is of little value,—and to me, what I part with is of much less. Let me not think you deem so wretchedly ill of mynation as your commons believe. Think ye that I prize these sparkling fragments of stone above my liberty? or that my father valuesthem in comparison to the honour of his only child? Accept them, lady—to me they are valueless. I will never wear jewels more.”“You are then unhappy!” said Rowena, struck with the manner in which Rebecca uttered the last words. “O, remain with us—thecounsel of holy men will wean you from your erring law, and I will be a sister to you.”“No, lady,” answered Rebecca, the same calm melancholy reigning in her soft voice and beautiful features—“that—may not be. Imay not change the faith of my fathers like a garment unsuited to the climate in which I seek to dwell, and unhappy, lady, I will not be.He, to whom I dedicate my future life, will be my comforter, if I do His will.”“Have you then convents, to one of which you mean to retire?” asked Rowena.“No, lady,” said the Jewess; “but among our people, since the time of Abraham downwards, have been women who have devotedtheir thoughts to Heaven, and their actions to works of kindness to men, tending the sick, feeding the hungry, and relieving thedistressed. Among these will Rebecca be numbered. Say this to thy lord, should he chance to enquire after the fate of her whose life hesaved.”There was an involuntary tremour on Rebecca’s voice, and a tenderness of accent, which perhaps betrayed more than she wouldwillingly have expressed. She hastened to bid Rowena adieu.“Farewell,” she said. “May He, who made both Jew and Christian, shower down on you his choicest blessings! The bark that waitsus hence will be under weigh ere we can reach the port.”She glided from the apartment, leaving Rowena surprised as if a vision had passed before her. The fair Saxon related the singularconference to her husband, on whose mind it made a deep impression. He lived long and happily with Rowena, for they were attachedto each other by the bonds of early affection, and they loved each other the more, from the recollection of the obstacles which hadimpeded their union. Yet it would be enquiring too curiously to ask, whether the recollection of Rebecca’s beauty and magnanimitydid not recur to his mind more frequently than the fair descendant of Alfred might altogether have approved.Ivanhoe distinguished himself in the service of Richard, and was graced with farther marks of the royal favour. He might have risenstill higher, but for the premature death of the heroic Cœur-de-Lion, before the Castle of Chaluz, near Limoges. With the life of agenerous, but rash and romantic monarch, perished all the projects which his ambition and his generosity had formed; to whom maybe applied, with a slight alteration, the lines composed by Johnson for Charles of Sweden—His fate was destined to a foreign strand,A petty fortress and an “humble” hand;He left the name at which the world grew pale,To point a moral, or adorn a TALE.NOTE TO CHAPTER I.Note A.—The Ranger or the Forest, that cuts the foreclaws off our dogs.A most sensible grievance of those aggrieved times were the Forest Laws. These oppressive enactments were the produce of theNorman Conquest, for the Saxon laws of the chase were mild and humane; while those of William, enthusiastically attached to theexercise and its rights, were to the last degree tyrannical. The formation of the New Forest, bears evidence to his passion for hunting,where he reduced many a happy village to the condition of that one commemorated by my friend, Mr William Stewart Rose:“Amongst the ruins of the churchThe midnight raven found a perch,A melancholy place;The ruthless Conqueror cast down,Woe worth the deed, that little town,To lengthen out his chase.”The disabling dogs, which might be necessary for keeping ﬂocks and herds, from running at the deer, was called “lawing”, and wasin general use. The Charter of the Forest designed to lessen those evils, declares that inquisition, or view, for lawing dogs, shall bemade every third year, and shall be then done by the view and testimony of lawful men, not otherwise; and they whose dogs shall bethen found unlawed, shall give three shillings for mercy, and for the future no man’s ox shall be taken for lawing. Such lawing alsoshall be done by the assize commonly used, and which is, that three claws shall be cut off without the ball of the right foot. See on thissubject the Historical Essay on the Magna Charta of King John, (a most beautiful volume), by Richard Thomson.NOTE TO CHAPTER II.Note B.—Negro Slaves.The severe accuracy of some critics has objected to the complexion of the slaves of Brian de Bois-Guilbert, as being totally out ofcostume and propriety. I remember the same objection being made to a set of sable functionaries, whom my friend, Mat Lewis,introduced as the guards and mischief-doing satellites of the wicked Baron, in his Castle Spectre. Mat treated the objection with greatcontempt, and averred in reply, that he made the slaves black in order to obtain a striking effect of contrast, and that, could he havederived a similar advantage from making his heroine blue, blue she should have been.I do not pretend to plead the immunities of my order so highly as this; but neither will I allow that the author of a modern antiqueromance is obliged to conﬁne himself to the introduction of those manners only which can be proved to have absolutely existed in thetimes he is depicting, so that he restrain himself to such as are plausible and natural, and contain no obvious anachronism. In this pointof view, what can be more natural, than that the Templars, who, we know, copied closely the luxuries of the Asiatic warriors withwhom they fought, should use the service of the enslaved Africans, whom the fate of war transferred to new masters? I am sure, ifthere are no precise proofs of their having done so, there is nothing, on the other hand, that can entitle us positively to conclude thatthey never did. Besides, there is an instance in romance.John of Rampayne, an excellent juggler and minstrel, undertook to effect the escape of one Audulf de Bracy, by presenting himselfin disguise at the court of the king, where he was conﬁned. For this purpose, “he stained his hair and his whole body entirely as blackas jet, so that nothing was white but his teeth,” and succeeded in imposing himself on the king, as an Ethiopian minstrel. He effected,by stratagem, the escape of the prisoner. Negroes, therefore, must have been known in England in the dark ages. 60NOTE TO CHAPTER XVII.Note C.—Minstrelsy.The realm of France, it is well known, was divided betwixt the Norman and Teutonic race, who spoke the language in which theword Yes is pronounced as “oui”, and the inhabitants of the southern regions, whose speech bearing some afﬁnity to the Italian,pronounced the same word “oc”. The poets of the former race were called “Minstrels”, and their poems “Lays”: those of the latterwere termed “Troubadours”, and their compositions called “sirventes”, and other names. Richard, a professed admirer of the joyousscience in all its branches, could imitate either the minstrel or troubadour. It is less likely that he should have been able to compose orsing an English ballad; yet so much do we wish to assimilate Him of the Lion Heart to the band of warriors whom he led, that theanachronism, if there be one may readily be forgiven.NOTE TO CHAPTER XXI.Note D.—Battle of Stamford.A great topographical blunder occurred here in former editions. The bloody battle alluded to in the text, fought and won by KingHarold, over his brother the rebellious Tosti, and an auxiliary force of Danes or Norsemen, was said, in the text, and a correspondingnote, to have taken place at Stamford, in Leicestershire, and upon the river Welland. This is a mistake, into which the author has beenled by trusting to his memory, and so confounding two places of the same name. The Stamford, Strangford, or Staneford, at which thebattle really was fought, is a ford upon the river Derwent, at the distance of about seven miles from York, and situated in that large andopulent county. A long wooden bridge over the Derwent, the site of which, with one remaining buttress, is still shown to the curioustraveller, was furiously contested. One Norwegian long defended it by his single arm, and was at length pierced with a spear thrustthrough the planks of the bridge from a boat beneath.The neighbourhood of Stamford, on the Derwent, contains some memorials of the battle. Horseshoes, swords, and the heads ofhalberds, or bills, are often found there; one place is called the “Danes’ well,” another the “Battle ﬂats.” From a tradition that theweapon with which the Norwegian champion was slain, resembled a pear, or, as others say, that the trough or boat in which the soldierﬂoated under the bridge to strike the blow, had such a shape, the country people usually begin a great market, which is held atStamford, with an entertainment called the Pear-pie feast, which after all may be a corruption of the Spear-pie feast. For moreparticulars, Drake’s History of York may be referred to. The author’s mistake was pointed out to him, in the most obliging manner, byRobert Belt, Esq. of Bossal House. The battle was fought in 1066.NOTE TO CHAPTER XXII.Note E.—The range of iron bars above that glowing charcoal.This horrid species of torture may remind the reader of that to which the Spaniards subjected Guatimozin, in order to extort adiscovery of his concealed wealth. But, in fact, an instance of similar barbarity is to be found nearer home, and occurs in the annals ofQueen Mary’s time, containing so many other examples of atrocity. Every reader must recollect, that after the fall of the CatholicChurch, and the Presbyterian Church Government had been established by law, the rank, and especially the wealth, of the Bishops,Abbots, Priors, and so forth, were no longer vested in ecclesiastics, but in lay impropriators of the church revenues, or, as the Scottishlawyers called them, titulars of the temporalities of the beneﬁce, though having no claim to the spiritual character of their predecessorsin ofﬁce.Of these laymen, who were thus invested with ecclesiastical revenues, some were men of high birth and rank, like the famous LordJames Stewart, the Prior of St Andrews, who did not fail to keep for their own use the rents, lands, and revenues of the church. But if,on the other hand, the titulars were men of inferior importance, who had been inducted into the ofﬁce by the interest of some powerfulperson, it was generally understood that the new Abbot should grant for his patron’s beneﬁt such leases and conveyances of the churchlands and tithes as might afford their protector the lion’s share of the booty. This was the origin of those who were wittily termedTulchan 61Bishops, being a sort of imaginary prelate, whose image was set up to enable his patron and principal to plunder the beneﬁce underhis name.There were other cases, however, in which men who had got grants of these secularised beneﬁces, were desirous of retaining themfor their own use, without having the inﬂuence sufﬁcient to establish their purpose; and these became frequently unable to protectthemselves, however unwilling to submit to the exactions of the feudal tyrant of the district.Bannatyne, secretary to John Knox, recounts a singular course of oppression practised on one of those titulars abbots, by the Earl ofCassilis in Ayrshire, whose extent of feudal inﬂuence was so wide that he was usually termed the King of Carrick. We give the fact asit occurs in Bannatyne’s Journal, only premising that the Journalist held his master’s opinions, both with respect to the Earl of Cassilisas an opposer of the king’s party, and as being a detester of the practice of granting church revenues to titulars, instead of their beingdevoted to pious uses, such as the support of the clergy, expense of schools, and the relief of the national poor. He mingles in thenarrative, therefore, a well deserved feeling of execration against the tyrant who employed the torture, which a tone of ridiculetowards the patient, as if, after all, it had not been ill bestowed on such an equivocal and amphibious character as a titular abbot. Heentitles his narrative,THE EARL OF CASSILIS’ TYRANNY AGAINST A QUICK (i.e. LIVING) MAN.“Master Allan Stewart, friend to Captain James Stewart of Cardonall, by means of the Queen’s corrupted court, obtained the Abbeyof Crossraguel. The said Earl thinking himself greater than any king in those quarters, determined to have that whole beneﬁce (as hehath divers others) to pay at his pleasure; and because he could not ﬁnd sic security as his insatiable appetite required, this shift wasdevised. The said Mr Allan being in company with the Laird of Bargany, (also a Kennedy,) was, by the Earl and his friends, enticed toleave the safeguard which he had with the Laird, and come to make good cheer with the said Earl. The simplicity of the imprudentman was suddenly abused; and so he passed his time with them certain days, which he did in Maybole with Thomas Kennedie, uncleto the said Earl; after which the said Mr Allan passed, with quiet company, to visit the place and bounds of Crossraguel, [his abbacy,]of which the said Earl being surely advertised, determined to put in practice the tyranny which long before he had conceived. And so,as king of the country, apprehended the said Mr Allan, and carried him to the house of Denure, where for a season he was honourablytreated, (if a prisoner can think any entertainment pleasing;) but after that certain days were spent, and that the Earl could not obtainthe feus of Crossraguel according to his own appetite, he determined to prove if a collation could work that which neither dinner norsupper could do for a long time. And so the said Mr Allan was carried to a secret chamber: with him passed the honourable Earl, hisworshipful brother, and such as were appointed to be servants at that banquet. In the chamber there was a grit iron chimlay, under it aﬁre; other grit provision was not seen. The ﬁrst course was,—‘My Lord Abbot,’ (said the Earl,) ‘it will please you confess here, thatwith your own consent you remain in my company, because ye durst not commit yourself to the hands of others.’ The Abbot answered,‘Would you, my lord, that I should make a manifest lie for your pleasure? The truth is, my lord, it is against my will that I am here;neither yet have I any pleasure in your company.’ ‘But ye shall remain with me, nevertheless, at this time,’ said the Earl. ‘I am not ableto resist your will and pleasure,’ said the Abbot, ‘in this place.’ ‘Ye must then obey me,’ said the Earl,—and with that were presentedunto him certain letters to subscribe, amongst which there was a ﬁve years’ tack, and a nineteen years’ tack, and a charter of feu of allthe lands (of Crossraguel), with all the clauses necessary for the Earl to haste him to hell. For if adultery, sacrilege, oppression,barbarous cruelty, and theft heaped upon theft, deserve hell, the great King of Carrick can no more escape hell for ever, than theimprudent Abbot escaped the ﬁre for a season as follows.“After that the Earl spied repugnance, and saw that he could not come to his purpose by fair means, he commanded his cooks toprepare the banquet: and so ﬁrst they ﬂayed the sheep, that is, they took off the Abbot’s cloathes even to his skin, and next they boundhim to the chimney—his legs to the one end, and his arms to the other; and so they began to beet [i.e. feed] the ﬁre sometimes to hisbuttocks, sometimes to his legs, sometimes to his shoulders and arms; and that the roast might not burn, but that it might rest in soppe,they spared not ﬂambing with oil, (basting as a cook bastes roasted meat); Lord, look thou to sic cruelty! And that the crying of themiserable man should not be heard, they dosed his mouth that the voice might be stopped. It may be suspected that some partisan ofthe King’s [Darnley’s] murder was there. In that torment they held the poor man, till that often he cried for God’s sake to dispatch him;for he had as meikle gold in his awin purse as would buy powder enough to shorten his pain. The famous King of Carrick and hiscooks perceiving the roast to be aneuch, commanded it to be tane fra the ﬁre, and the Earl himself began the grace in this manner:—‘Benedicite, Jesus Maria, you are the most obstinate man that ever I saw; gif I had known that ye had been so stubborn, I would notfor a thousand crowns have handled you so; I never did so to man before you.’ And yet he returned to the same practice within twodays, and ceased not till that he obtained his formost purpose, that is, that he had got all his pieces subscryvit alsweill as ane half-roasted hand could do it. The Earl thinking himself sure enough so long as he had the half-roasted Abbot in his own keeping, and yetbeing ashamed of his presence by reason of his former cruelty, left the place of Denure in the hands of certain of his servants, and thehalf-roasted Abbot to be kept there as prisoner. The Laird of Bargany, out of whose company the said Abbot had been enticed,understanding, (not the extremity,) but the retaining of the man, sent to the court, and raised letters of deliverance of the person of theman according to the order, which being disobeyed, the said Earl for his contempt was denounced rebel, and put to the horne. But yethope was there none, neither to the afﬂicted to be delivered, neither yet to the purchaser [i.e. procurer] of the letters to obtain anycomfort thereby; for in that time God was despised, and the lawful authority was contemned in Scotland, in hope of the sudden returnand regiment of that cruel murderer of her awin husband, of whose lords the said Earl was called one; and yet, oftener than once, hewas solemnly sworn to the King and to his Regent.”The Journalist then recites the complaint of the injured Allan Stewart, Commendator of Crossraguel, to the Regent and PrivyCouncil, averring his having been carried, partly by ﬂattery, partly by force, to the black vault of Denure, a strong fortalice, built on arock overhanging the Irish channel, where to execute leases and conveyances of the whole churches and parsonages belonging to theAbbey of Crossraguel, which he utterly refused as an unreasonable demand, and the more so that he had already conveyed them toJohn Stewart of Cardonah, by whose interest he had been made Commendator. The complainant proceeds to state, that he was, aftermany menaces, stript, bound, and his limbs exposed to ﬁre in the manner already described, till, compelled by excess of agony, hesubscribed the charter and leases presented to him, of the contents of which he was totally ignorant. A few days afterwards, beingagain required to execute a ratiﬁcation of these deeds before a notary and witnesses, and refusing to do so, he was once more subjectedto the same torture, until his agony was so excessive that he exclaimed, “Fye on you, why do you not strike your whingers into me, orblow me up with a barrel of powder, rather than torture me thus unmercifully?” upon which the Earl commanded Alexander Richard,one of his attendants, to stop the patient’s mouth with a napkin, which was done accordingly. Thus he was once more compelled tosubmit to their tyranny. The petition concluded with stating, that the Earl, under pretence of the deeds thus iniquitously obtained, hadtaken possession of the whole place and living of Crossraguel, and enjoyed the proﬁts thereof for three years.The doom of the Regent and Council shows singularly the total interruption of justice at this calamitous period, even in the mostclamant cases of oppression. The Council declined interference with the course of the ordinary justice of the county, (which wascompletely under the said Earl of Cassilis’ control,) and only enacted, that he should forbear molestation of the unfortunateComendator, under the surety of two thousand pounds Scots. The Earl was appointed also to keep the peace towards the celebratedGeorge Buchanan, who had a pension out of the same Abbacy, to a similar extent, and under the like penalty.The consequences are thus described by the Journalist already quoted.—“The said Laird of Bargany perceiving that the ordiner justice could neither help the oppressed, nor yet the afﬂicted, applied hismind to the next remedy, and in the end, by his servants, took the house of Denure, where the poor Abbot was kept prisoner. The bruitﬂew fra Carrick to Galloway, and so suddenly assembled herd and hyre-man that pertained to the band of the Kennedies; and so withina few hours was the house of Denure environed again. The master of Cassilis was the frackast [i.e. the readiest or boldest] and wouldnot stay, but in his heat would lay ﬁre to the dungeon, with no small boasting that all enemies within the house should die.“He was required and admonished by those that were within to be more moderate, and not to hazard himself so foolishly. But noadmonition would help, till that the wind of an hacquebute blasted his shoulder, and then ceased he from further pursuit in fury. TheLaird of Bargany had before purchest [obtained] of the authorities, letters, charging all faithfull subjects to the King’s Majesty, toassist him against that cruel tyrant and mansworn traitor, the Earl of Cassilis; which letters, with his private writings, he published, andshortly found sic concurrence of Kyle and Cunynghame with his other friends, that the Carrick company drew back fra the house: andso the other approached, furnished the house with more men, delivered the said Mr Allan, and carried him to Ayr, where, publicly atthe market cross of the said town, he declared how cruelly he was entreated, and how the murdered King suffered not sic torment as hedid, excepting only he escaped the death: and, therefore, publickly did revoke all things that were done in that extremity, andespecially revoked the subscription of the three writings, to wit, of a fyve yeir tack and nineteen year tack, and of a charter of feu. Andso the house remained, and remains (till this day, the 7th of February, 1571,) in the custody of the said Laird of Bargany and of hisservants. And so cruelty was disappointed of proffeit present, and shall be eternallie punished, unless he earnestly repent. And this farfor the cruelty committed, to give occasion unto others, and to such as hate the monstrous dealing of degenerate nobility, to look morediligently upon their behaviuours, and to paint them forth unto the world, that they themselves may be ashamed of their ownbeastliness, and that the world may be advertised and admonished to abhor, detest, and avoid the company of all sic tyrants, who arenot worthy of the society of men, but ought to be sent suddenly to the devil, with whom they must burn without end, for theircontempt of God, and cruelty committed against his creatures. Let Cassilis and his brother be the ﬁrst to be the example unto others.Amen. Amen.” 62This extract has been somewhat amended or modernized in orthography, to render it more intelligible to the general reader. I have toadd, that the Kennedies of Bargany, who interfered in behalf of the oppressed Abbot, were themselves a younger branch of the Cassilisfamily, but held different politics, and were powerful enough in this, and other instances, to bid them deﬁance.The ultimate issue of this affair does not appear; but as the house of Cassilis are still in possession of the greater part of the feus andleases which belonged to Crossraguel Abbey, it is probable the talons of the King of Carrick were strong enough, in those disorderlytimes, to retain the prey which they had so mercilessly ﬁxed upon.I may also add, that it appears by some papers in my possession, that the ofﬁcers or Country Keepers on the border, wereaccustomed to torment their prisoners by binding them to the iron bars of their chimneys, to extort confession.NOTE TO CHAPTER XXIXNote F.—HeraldryThe author has been here upbraided with false heraldry, as having charged metal upon metal. It should be remembered, however,that heraldry had only its ﬁrst rude origin during the crusades, and that all the minutiae of its fantastic science were the work of time,and introduced at a much later period. Those who think otherwise must suppose that the Goddess of “Armoirers”, like the Goddess ofArms, sprung into the world completely equipped in all the gaudy trappings of the department she presides over.Additional NoteIn corroboration of said note, it may be observed, that the arms, which were assumed by Godfrey of Boulogne himself, after theconquest of Jerusalem, was a cross counter patent cantoned with four little crosses or, upon a ﬁeld azure, displaying thus metal uponmetal. The heralds have tried to explain this undeniable fact in different modes—but Ferne gallantly contends, that a prince ofGodfrey’s qualities should not be bound by the ordinary rules. The Scottish Nisbet, and the same Ferne, insist that the chiefs of theCrusade must have assigned to Godfrey this extraordinary and unwonted coat-of-arms, in order to induce those who should beholdthem to make enquiries; and hence give them the name of “arma inquirenda”. But with reverence to these grave authorities, it seemsunlikely that the assembled princes of Europe should have adjudged to Godfrey a coat armorial so much contrary to the general rule, ifsuch rule had then existed; at any rate, it proves that metal upon metal, now accounted a solecism in heraldry, was admitted in othercases similar to that in the text. See Ferne’s “Blazon of Gentrie” p. 238. Edition 1586. Nisbet’s “Heraldry”, vol. i. p. 113. SecondEdition.NOTE TO CHAPTER XXXINote G.—Ulrica’s Death song.It will readily occur to the antiquary, that these verses are intended to imitate the antique poetry of the Scalds—the minstrels of theold Scandinavians—the race, as the Laureate so happily terms them,“Stern to inﬂict, and stubborn to endure,Who smiled in death.”The poetry of the Anglo-Saxons, after their civilisation and conversion, was of a different and softer character; but in thecircumstances of Ulrica, she may be not unnaturally supposed to return to the wild strains which animated her forefathers during thetime of Paganism and untamed ferocity.NOTE TO CHAPTER XXXIINote H.—Richard Cœur-de-Lion.The interchange of a cuff with the jolly priest is not entirely out of character with Richard I., if romances read him aright. In thevery curious romance on the subject of his adventures in the Holy Land, and his return from thence, it is recorded how he exchanged apugilistic favour of this nature, while a prisoner in Germany. His opponent was the son of his principal warder, and was so imprudentas to give the challenge to this barter of buffets. The King stood forth like a true man, and received a blow which staggered him. Inrequital, having previously waxed his hand, a practice unknown, I believe, to the gentlemen of the modern fancy, he returned the boxon the ear with such interest as to kill his antagonist on the spot.—See, in Ellis’s Specimens of English Romance, that of Cœur-de-Lion.NOTE TO CHAPTER XXXIIINote I.—Hedge-Priests.It is curious to observe, that in every state of society, some sort of ghostly consolation is provided for the members of thecommunity, though assembled for purposes diametrically opposite to religion. A gang of beggars have their Patrico, and the banditti ofthe Apennines have among them persons acting as monks and priests, by whom they are confessed, and who perform mass beforethem. Unquestionably, such reverend persons, in such a society, must accommodate their manners and their morals to the communityin which they live; and if they can occasionally obtain a degree of reverence for their supposed spiritual gifts, are, on most occasions,loaded with unmerciful ridicule, as possessing a character inconsistent with all around them.Hence the ﬁghting parson in the old play of Sir John Oldcastle, and the famous friar of Robin Hood’s band. Nor were suchcharacters ideal. There exists a monition of the Bishop of Durham against irregular churchmen of this class, who associatedthemselves with Border robbers, and desecrated the holiest ofﬁces of the priestly function, by celebrating them for the beneﬁt ofthieves, robbers, and murderers, amongst ruins and in caverns of the earth, without regard to canonical form, and with torn and dirtyattire, and maimed rites, altogether improper for the occasion.NOTE TO CHAPTER XLI.Note J.—Castle of Coningsburgh.When I last saw this interesting ruin of ancient days, one of the very few remaining examples of Saxon fortiﬁcation, I was stronglyimpressed with the desire of tracing out a sort of theory on the subject, which, from some recent acquaintance with the architecture ofthe ancient Scandinavians, seemed to me peculiarly interesting. I was, however, obliged by circumstances to proceed on my journey,without leisure to take more than a transient view of Coningsburgh. Yet the idea dwells so strongly in my mind, that I feelconsiderably tempted to write a page or two in detailing at least the outline of my hypothesis, leaving better antiquaries to correct orrefute conclusions which are perhaps too hastily drawn.Those who have visited the Zetland Islands, are familiar with the description of castles called by the inhabitants Burghs; and by theHighlanders—for they are also to be found both in the Western Isles and on the mainland—Duns. Pennant has engraved a view of thefamous Dun-Dornadilla in Glenelg; and there are many others, all of them built after a peculiar mode of architecture, which argues apeople in the most primitive state of society. The most perfect specimen is that upon the island of Mousa, near to the mainland ofZetland, which is probably in the same state as when inhabited.It is a single round tower, the wall curving in slightly, and then turning outward again in the form of a dice-box, so that thedefenders on the top might the better protect the base. It is formed of rough stones, selected with care, and laid in courses or circles,with much compactness, but without cement of any kind. The tower has never, to appearance, had rooﬁng of any sort; a ﬁre was madein the centre of the space which it encloses, and originally the building was probably little more than a wall drawn as a sort of screenaround the great council ﬁre of the tribe. But, although the means or ingenuity of the builders did not extend so far as to provide aroof, they supplied the want by constructing apartments in the interior of the walls of the tower itself. The circumvallation formed adouble enclosure, the inner side of which was, in fact, two feet or three feet distant from the other, and connected by a concentricrange of long ﬂat stones, thus forming a series of concentric rings or stories of various heights, rising to the top of the tower. Each ofthese stories or galleries has four windows, facing directly to the points of the compass, and rising of course regularly above eachother. These four perpendicular ranges of windows admitted air, and, the ﬁre being kindled, heat, or smoke at least, to each of thegalleries. The access from gallery to gallery is equally primitive. A path, on the principle of an inclined plane, turns round and roundthe building like a screw, and gives access to the different stories, intersecting each of them in its turn, and thus gradually rising to thetop of the wall of the tower. On the outside there are no windows; and I may add, that an enclosure of a square, or sometimes a roundform, gave the inhabitants of the Burgh an opportunity to secure any sheep or cattle which they might possess.Such is the general architecture of that very early period when the Northmen swept the seas, and brought to their rude houses, suchas I have described them, the plunder of polished nations. In Zetland there are several scores of these Burghs, occupying in every case,capes, headlands, islets, and similar places of advantage singularly well chosen. I remember the remains of one upon an island in asmall lake near Lerwick, which at high tide communicates with the sea, the access to which is very ingenious, by means of a causewayor dike, about three or four inches under the surface of the water. This causeway makes a sharp angle in its approach to the Burgh. Theinhabitants, doubtless, were well acquainted with this, but strangers, who might approach in a hostile manner, and were ignorant of thecurve of the causeway, would probably plunge into the lake, which is six or seven feet in depth at the least. This must have been thedevice of some Vauban or Cohorn of those early times.The style of these buildings evinces that the architect possessed neither the art of using lime or cement of any kind, nor the skill tothrow an arch, construct a roof, or erect a stair; and yet, with all this ignorance, showed great ingenuity in selecting the situation ofBurghs, and regulating the access to them, as well as neatness and regularity in the erection, since the buildings themselves show astyle of advance in the arts scarcely consistent with the ignorance of so many of the principal branches of architectural knowledge.I have always thought, that one of the most curious and valuable objects of antiquaries has been to trace the progress of society, bythe efforts made in early ages to improve the rudeness of their ﬁrst expedients, until they either approach excellence, or, as is morefrequently the case, are supplied by new and fundamental discoveries, which supersede both the earlier and ruder system, and theimprovements which have been ingrafted upon it. For example, if we conceive the recent discovery of gas to be so much improvedand adapted to domestic use, as to supersede all other modes of producing domestic light; we can already suppose, some centuriesafterwards, the heads of a whole Society of Antiquaries half turned by the discovery of a pair of patent snuffers, and by the learnedtheories which would be brought forward to account for the form and purpose of so singular an implement.Following some such principle, I am inclined to regard the singular Castle of Coningsburgh—I mean the Saxon part of it—as a stepin advance from the rude architecture, if it deserves the name, which must have been common to the Saxons as to other Northmen.The builders had attained the art of using cement, and of rooﬁng a building,—great improvements on the original Burgh. But in theround keep, a shape only seen in the most ancient castles—the chambers excavated in the thickness of the walls and buttresses—thedifﬁculty by which access is gained from one story to those above it, Coningsburgh still retains the simplicity of its origin, and showsby what slow degrees man proceeded from occupying such rude and inconvenient lodgings, as were afforded by the galleries of theCastle of Mousa, to the more splendid accommodations of the Norman castles, with all their stern and Gothic graces.I am ignorant if these remarks are new, or if they will be conﬁrmed by closer examination; but I think, that, on a hasty observation,Coningsburgh offers means of curious study to those who may wish to trace the history of architecture back to the times preceding theNorman Conquest.It would be highly desirable that a cork model should be taken of the Castle of Mousa, as it cannot be well understood by a plan.The Castle of Coningsburgh is thus described:—“The castle is large, the outer walls standing on a pleasant ascent from the river, but much overtopt by a high hill, on which the townstands, situated at the head of a rich and magniﬁcent vale, formed by an amphitheatre of woody hills, in which ﬂows the gentle Don.Near the castle is a barrow, said to be Hengist’s tomb. The entrance is ﬂanked to the left by a round tower, with a sloping base, andthere are several similar in the outer wall the entrance has piers of a gate, and on the east side the ditch and bank are double and verysteep. On the top of the churchyard wall is a tombstone, on which are cut in high relief, two ravens, or such-like birds. On the southside of the churchyard lies an ancient stone, ridged like a cofﬁn, on which is carved a man on horseback; and another man with ashield encountering a vast winged serpent, and a man bearing a shield behind him. It was probably one of the rude crosses notuncommon in churchyards in this county. See it engraved on the plate of crosses for this volume, plate 14. ﬁg. 1. The name ofConingsburgh, by which this castle goes in the old editions of the Britannia, would lead one to suppose it the residence of the Saxonkings. It afterwards belonged to King Harold. The Conqueror bestowed it on William de Warren, with all its privileges andjurisdiction, which are said to have extended over twenty-eight towns. At the corner of the area, which is of an irregular form, standsthe great tower, or keep, placed on a small hill of its own dimensions, on which lies six vast projecting buttresses, ascending in a steepdirection to prop and support the building, and continued upwards up the side as turrets. The tower within forms a complete circle,twenty-one feet in diameter, the walls fourteen feet thick. The ascent into the tower is by an exceeding deep ﬂight of steep steps, fourfeet and a half wide, on the south side leading to a low doorway, over which is a circular arch crossed by a great transom stone. Withinthis door is the staircase which ascends straight through the thickness of the wall, not communicating with the room on the ﬁrst ﬂoor,in whose centre is the opening to the dungeon. Neither of these lower rooms is lighted except from a hole in the ﬂoor of the thirdstory; the room in which, as well as in that above it, is ﬁnished with compact smooth stonework, both having chimney-pieces, with anarch resting on triple clustered pillars. In the third story, or guard-chamber, is a small recess with a loop-hole, probably a bedchamber,and in that ﬂoor above a niche for a saint or holy-water pot. Mr. King imagines this a Saxon castle of the ﬁrst ages of the Heptarchy.Mr. Watson thus describes it. From the ﬁrst ﬂoor to the second story, (third from the ground,) is a way by a stair in the wall ﬁve feetwide. The next staircase is approached by a ladder, and ends at the fourth story from the ground. Two yards from the door, at the headof this stair, is an opening nearly east, accessible by treading on the ledge of the wall, which diminishes eight inches each story; andthis last opening leads into a room or chapel ten feet by twelve, and ﬁfteen or sixteen high, arched with free-stone, and supported bysmall circular columns of the same, the capitals and arches Saxon. It has an east window, and on each side in the wall, about four feetfrom the ground, a stone basin with a hole and iron pipe to convey the water into or through the wall. This chapel is one of thebuttresses, but no sign of it without, for even the window, though large within, is only a long narrow loop-hole, scarcely to be seenwithout. On the left side of this chapel is a small oratory, eight by six in the thickness of the wall, with a niche in the wall, andenlightened by a like loop-hole. The fourth stair from the ground, ten feet west from the chapel door, leads to the top of the towerthrough the thickness of the wall, which at top is but three yards. Each story is about ﬁfteen feet high, so that the tower will beseventy-ﬁve feet from the ground. The inside forms a circle, whose diameter may be about twelve feet. The well at the bottom of thedungeon is piled with stones.”—Gough’s “Edition Of Camden’s Britannia”.

L. T.]14 (return)[ There was no language which the Normans more formally separated from that of common life than the terms of thechase. The objects of their pursuit, whether bird or animal, changed their name each year, and there were a hundredconventional terms, to be ignorant of which was to be without one of the distinguishing marks of a gentleman. The readermay consult Dame Juliana Berners’ book on the subject. The origin of this science was imputed to the celebrated SirTristrem, famous for his tragic intrigue with the beautiful Ysolte. As the Normans reserved the amusement of huntingstrictly to themselves, the terms of this formal jargon were all taken from the French language.]15 (return)[ In those days the Jews were subjected to an Exchequer, specially dedicated to that purpose, and which laid them underthe most exorbitant impositions.—L.

Even William theConqueror, hated as he was by them, continued to draw a considerable army of Anglo-Saxons to his standard, bythreatening to stigmatize those who staid at home, as nidering. Bartholinus, I think, mentions a similar phrase which hadlike inﬂuence on the Danes. L.

Pavisses were a species of large shields covering the whole person, employed on the sameoccasions.]33 (return)[ The bolt was the arrow peculiarly ﬁtted to the cross-bow, as that of the long-bow was called a shaft. Hence the Englishproverb—“I will either make a shaft or bolt of it,” signifying a determination to make one use or other of the thing spokenof.]34 (return)[ The arblast was a cross-bow, the windlace the machine used in bending that weapon, and the quarrell, so called from itssquare or diamond-shaped head, was the bolt adapted to it.]35 (return)[ Note F. Heraldry]36 (return)[ Every Gothic castle and city had, beyond the outer-walls, a fortiﬁcation composed of palisades, called the barriers, whichwere often the scene of severe skirmishes, as these must necessarily be carried before the walls themselves could beapproached. Many of those valiant feats of arms which adorn the chivalrous pages of Froissart took place at the barriers ofbesieged places.]37 (return)[ “Derring-do”—desperate courage.]38 (return)[ The author has some idea that this passage is imitated from the appearance of Philidaspes, before the divine Mandane,when the city of Babylon is on ﬁre, and he proposes to carry her from the ﬂames.

But theseterms were sometimes, it would seem, used indiscriminately.]49 (return)[ In the ordinances of the Knights of the Temple, this phrase is repeated in a variety of forms, and occurs in almost everychapter, as if it were the signal-word of the Order; which may account for its being so frequently put in the Grand Master’smouth.]50 (return)[ See the 13th chapter of Leviticus.]51 (return)[ The edict which he quotes, is against communion with women of light character.]53 (return)[ The reader is again referred to the Rules of the Poor Military Brotherhood of the Temple, which occur in the Works of StBernard.
