1817.                   IVANHOE.                   CHAPTER I        Thus communed these; while to their lowly dome,   The full-fed swine return&rsquo;d with evening home;   Compell&rsquo;d, reluctant, to the several sties,   With din obstreperous, and ungrateful cries.          P OPE&rsquo;S  O DYSSEY           In that pleasant district of merry England which is watered by the river Don,  there extended in ancient times a large forest, covering the greater part of  the beautiful hills and valleys which lie between Sheffield and the pleasant  town of Doncaster. The remains of this extensive wood are still to be seen at  the noble seats of Wentworth, of Warncliffe Park, and around Rotherham. Here  haunted of yore the fabulous Dragon of Wantley; here were fought many of the  most desperate battles during the Civil Wars of the Roses; and here also  flourished in ancient times those bands of gallant outlaws, whose deeds have  been rendered so popular in English song.          Such being our chief scene, the date of our story refers to a period towards  the end of the reign of Richard I., when his return from his long captivity had  become an event rather wished than hoped for by his despairing subjects, who  were in the meantime subjected to every species of subordinate oppression. The  nobles, whose power had become exorbitant during the reign of Stephen, and whom  the prudence of Henry the Second had scarce reduced to some degree of  subjection to the crown, had now resumed their ancient license in its utmost  extent; despising the feeble interference of the English Council of State,  fortifying their castles, increasing the number of their dependants, reducing  all around them to a state of vassalage, and striving by every means in their  power, to place themselves each at the head of such forces as might enable him  to make a figure in the national convulsions which appeared to be impending.          The situation of the inferior gentry, or Franklins, as they were called, who,  by the law and spirit of the English constitution, were entitled to hold  themselves independent of feudal tyranny, became now unusually precarious. If,  as was most generally the case, they placed themselves under the protection of  any of the petty kings in their vicinity, accepted of feudal offices in his  household, or bound themselves by mutual treaties of alliance and protection,  to support him in his enterprises, they might indeed purchase temporary repose;  but it must be with the sacrifice of that independence which was so dear to  every English bosom, and at the certain hazard of being involved as a party in  whatever rash expedition the ambition of their protector might lead him to  undertake. On the other hand, such and so multiplied were the means of vexation  and oppression possessed by the great Barons, that they never wanted the  pretext, and seldom the will, to harass and pursue, even to the very edge of  destruction, any of their less powerful neighbours, who attempted to separate  themselves from their authority, and to trust for their protection, during the  dangers of the times, to their own inoffensive conduct, and to the laws of the  land.          A circumstance which greatly tended to enhance the tyranny of the nobility, and  the sufferings of the inferior classes, arose from the consequences of the  Conquest by Duke William of Normandy. Four generations had not sufficed to  blend the hostile blood of the Normans and Anglo-Saxons, or to unite, by common  language and mutual interests, two hostile races, one of which still felt the  elation of triumph, while the other groaned under all the consequences of  defeat. The power had been completely placed in the hands of the Norman  nobility, by the event of the battle of Hastings, and it had been used, as our  histories assure us, with no moderate hand. The whole race of Saxon princes and  nobles had been extirpated or disinherited, with few or no exceptions; nor were  the numbers great who possessed land in the country of their fathers, even as  proprietors of the second, or of yet inferior classes. The royal policy had  long been to weaken, by every means, legal or illegal, the strength of a part  of the population which was justly considered as nourishing the most inveterate  antipathy to their victor. All the monarchs of the Norman race had shown the  most marked predilection for their Norman subjects; the laws of the chase, and  many others equally unknown to the milder and more free spirit of the Saxon  constitution, had been fixed upon the necks of the subjugated inhabitants, to  add weight, as it were, to the feudal chains with which they were loaded. At  court, and in the castles of the great nobles, where the pomp and state of a  court was emulated, Norman-French was the only language employed; in courts of  law, the pleadings and judgments were delivered in the same tongue. In short,  French was the language of honour, of chivalry, and even of justice, while the  far more manly and expressive Anglo-Saxon was abandoned to the use of rustics  and hinds, who knew no other. Still, however, the necessary intercourse between  the lords of the soil, and those oppressed inferior beings by whom that soil  was cultivated, occasioned the gradual formation of a dialect, compounded  betwixt the French and the Anglo-Saxon, in which they could render themselves  mutually intelligible to each other; and from this necessity arose by degrees  the structure of our present English language, in which the speech of the  victors and the vanquished have been so happily blended together; and which has  since been so richly improved by importations from the classical languages, and  from those spoken by the southern nations of Europe.          This state of things I have thought it necessary to premise for the information  of the general reader, who might be apt to forget, that, although no great  historical events, such as war or insurrection, mark the existence of the  Anglo-Saxons as a separate people subsequent to the reign of William the  Second; yet the great national distinctions betwixt them and their conquerors,  the recollection of what they had formerly been, and to what they were now  reduced, continued down to the reign of Edward the Third, to keep open the  wounds which the Conquest had inflicted, and to maintain a line of separation  betwixt the descendants of the victor Normans and the vanquished Saxons.          The sun was setting upon one of the rich grassy glades of that forest, which we  have mentioned in the beginning of the chapter. Hundreds of broad-headed,  short-stemmed, wide-branched oaks, which had witnessed perhaps the stately  march of the Roman soldiery, flung their gnarled arms over a thick carpet of  the most delicious green sward; in some places they were intermingled with  beeches, hollies, and copsewood of various descriptions, so closely as totally  to intercept the level beams of the sinking sun; in others they receded from  each other, forming those long sweeping vistas, in the intricacy of which the  eye delights to lose itself, while imagination considers them as the paths to  yet wilder scenes of silvan solitude. Here the red rays of the sun shot a  broken and discoloured light, that partially hung upon the shattered boughs and  mossy trunks of the trees, and there they illuminated in brilliant patches the  portions of turf to which they made their way. A considerable open space, in  the midst of this glade, seemed formerly to have been dedicated to the rites of  Druidical superstition; for, on the summit of a hillock, so regular as to seem  artificial, there still remained part of a circle of rough unhewn stones, of  large dimensions. Seven stood upright; the rest had been dislodged from their  places, probably by the zeal of some convert to Christianity, and lay, some  prostrate near their former site, and others on the side of the hill. One large  stone only had found its way to the bottom, and in stopping the course of a  small brook, which glided smoothly round the foot of the eminence, gave, by its  opposition, a feeble voice of murmur to the placid and elsewhere silent  streamlet.          The human figures which completed this landscape, were in number two,  partaking, in their dress and appearance, of that wild and rustic character,  which belonged to the woodlands of the West-Riding of Yorkshire at that early  period. The eldest of these men had a stern, savage, and wild aspect. His  garment was of the simplest form imaginable, being a close jacket with sleeves,  composed of the tanned skin of some animal, on which the hair had been  originally left, but which had been worn off in so many places, that it would  have been difficult to distinguish from the patches that remained, to what  creature the fur had belonged. This primeval vestment reached from the throat  to the knees, and served at once all the usual purposes of body-clothing; there  was no wider opening at the collar, than was necessary to admit the passage of  the head, from which it may be inferred, that it was put on by slipping it over  the head and shoulders, in the manner of a modern shirt, or ancient hauberk.  Sandals, bound with thongs made of boars&rsquo; hide, protected the feet, and a  roll of thin leather was twined artificially round the legs, and, ascending  above the calf, left the knees bare, like those of a Scottish Highlander. To  make the jacket sit yet more close to the body, it was gathered at the middle  by a broad leathern belt, secured by a brass buckle; to one side of which was  attached a sort of scrip, and to the other a ram&rsquo;s horn, accoutred with a  mouthpiece, for the purpose of blowing. In the same belt was stuck one of those  long, broad, sharp-pointed, and two-edged knives, with a buck&rsquo;s-horn  handle, which were fabricated in the neighbourhood, and bore even at this early  period the name of a Sheffield whittle. The man had no covering upon his head,  which was only defended by his own thick hair, matted and twisted together, and  scorched by the influence of the sun into a rusty dark-red colour, forming a  contrast with the overgrown beard upon his cheeks, which was rather of a yellow  or amber hue. One part of his dress only remains, but it is too remarkable to  be suppressed; it was a brass ring, resembling a dog&rsquo;s collar, but  without any opening, and soldered fast round his neck, so loose as to form no  impediment to his breathing, yet so tight as to be incapable of being removed,  excepting by the use of the file. On this singular gorget was engraved, in  Saxon characters, an inscription of the following purport:&mdash;&ldquo;Gurth,  the son of Beowulph, is the born thrall of Cedric of Rotherwood.&rdquo;          Beside the swine-herd, for such was Gurth&rsquo;s occupation, was seated, upon  one of the fallen Druidical monuments, a person about ten years younger in  appearance, and whose dress, though resembling his companion&rsquo;s in form,  was of better materials, and of a more fantastic appearance. His jacket had  been stained of a bright purple hue, upon which there had been some attempt to  paint grotesque ornaments in different colours. To the jacket he added a short  cloak, which scarcely reached half way down his thigh; it was of crimson cloth,  though a good deal soiled, lined with bright yellow; and as he could transfer  it from one shoulder to the other, or at his pleasure draw it all around him,  its width, contrasted with its want of longitude, formed a fantastic piece of  drapery. He had thin silver bracelets upon his arms, and on his neck a collar  of the same metal bearing the inscription, &ldquo;Wamba, the son of Witless, is  the thrall of Cedric of Rotherwood.&rdquo; This personage had the same sort of  sandals with his companion, but instead of the roll of leather thong, his legs  were cased in a sort of gaiters, of which one was red and the other yellow. He  was provided also with a cap, having around it more than one bell, about the  size of those attached to hawks, which jingled as he turned his head to one  side or other; and as he seldom remained a minute in the same posture, the  sound might be considered as incessant. Around the edge of this cap was a stiff  bandeau of leather, cut at the top into open work, resembling a coronet, while  a prolonged bag arose from within it, and fell down on one shoulder like an  old-fashioned nightcap, or a jelly-bag, or the head-gear of a modern hussar. It  was to this part of the cap that the bells were attached; which circumstance,  as well as the shape of his head-dress, and his own half-crazed, half-cunning  expression of countenance, sufficiently pointed him out as belonging to the  race of domestic clowns or jesters, maintained in the houses of the wealthy, to  help away the tedium of those lingering hours which they were obliged to spend  within doors. He bore, like his companion, a scrip, attached to his belt, but  had neither horn nor knife, being probably considered as belonging to a class  whom it is esteemed dangerous to intrust with edge-tools. In place of these, he  was equipped with a sword of lath, resembling that with which Harlequin  operates his wonders upon the modern stage.          The outward appearance of these two men formed scarce a stronger contrast than  their look and demeanour. That of the serf, or bondsman, was sad and sullen;  his aspect was bent on the ground with an appearance of deep dejection, which  might be almost construed into apathy, had not the fire which occasionally  sparkled in his red eye manifested that there slumbered, under the appearance  of sullen despondency, a sense of oppression, and a disposition to resistance.  The looks of Wamba, on the other hand, indicated, as usual with his class, a  sort of vacant curiosity, and fidgetty impatience of any posture of repose,  together with the utmost self-satisfaction respecting his own situation, and  the appearance which he made. The dialogue which they maintained between them,  was carried on in Anglo-Saxon, which, as we said before, was universally spoken  by the inferior classes, excepting the Norman soldiers, and the immediate  personal dependants of the great feudal nobles. But to give their conversation  in the original would convey but little information to the modern reader, for  whose benefit we beg to offer the following translation:          &ldquo;The curse of St Withold upon these infernal porkers!&rdquo; said the  swine-herd, after blowing his horn obstreperously, to collect together the  scattered herd of swine, which, answering his call with notes equally  melodious, made, however, no haste to remove themselves from the luxurious  banquet of beech-mast and acorns on which they had fattened, or to forsake the  marshy banks of the rivulet, where several of them, half plunged in mud, lay  stretched at their ease, altogether regardless of the voice of their keeper.  &ldquo;The curse of St Withold upon them and upon me!&rdquo; said Gurth;  &ldquo;if the two-legged wolf snap not up some of them ere nightfall, I am no  true man. Here, Fangs! Fangs!&rdquo; he ejaculated at the top of his voice to a  ragged wolfish-looking dog, a sort of lurcher, half mastiff, half greyhound,  which ran limping about as if with the purpose of seconding his master in  collecting the refractory grunters; but which, in fact, from misapprehension of  the swine-herd&rsquo;s signals, ignorance of his own duty, or malice prepense,  only drove them hither and thither, and increased the evil which he seemed to  design to remedy. &ldquo;A devil draw the teeth of him,&rdquo; said Gurth,  &ldquo;and the mother of mischief confound the Ranger of the forest, that cuts  the foreclaws off our dogs, and makes them unfit for their trade!   8    Wamba, up and help me an thou be&rsquo;st a man; take a turn round the back  o&rsquo; the hill to gain the wind on them; and when thous&rsquo;t got the  weather-gage, thou mayst drive them before thee as gently as so many innocent  lambs.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Wamba, without stirring from the spot, &ldquo;I have  consulted my legs upon this matter, and they are altogether of opinion, that to  carry my gay garments through these sloughs, would be an act of unfriendship to  my sovereign person and royal wardrobe; wherefore, Gurth, I advise thee to call  off Fangs, and leave the herd to their destiny, which, whether they meet with  bands of travelling soldiers, or of outlaws, or of wandering pilgrims, can be  little else than to be converted into Normans before morning, to thy no small  ease and comfort.&rdquo;          &ldquo;The swine turned Normans to my comfort!&rdquo; quoth Gurth;  &ldquo;expound that to me, Wamba, for my brain is too dull, and my mind too  vexed, to read riddles.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Why, how call you those grunting brutes running about on their four  legs?&rdquo; demanded Wamba.          &ldquo;Swine, fool, swine,&rdquo; said the herd, &ldquo;every fool knows  that.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And swine is good Saxon,&rdquo; said the Jester; &ldquo;but how call you  the sow when she is flayed, and drawn, and quartered, and hung up by the heels,  like a traitor?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Pork,&rdquo; answered the swine-herd.          &ldquo;I am very glad every fool knows that too,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;and  pork, I think, is good Norman-French; and so when the brute lives, and is in  the charge of a Saxon slave, she goes by her Saxon name; but becomes a Norman,  and is called pork, when she is carried to the Castle-hall to feast among the  nobles; what dost thou think of this, friend Gurth, ha?&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is but too true doctrine, friend Wamba, however it got into thy  fool&rsquo;s pate.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay, I can tell you more,&rdquo; said Wamba, in the same tone;  &ldquo;there is old Alderman Ox continues to hold his Saxon epithet, while he  is under the charge of serfs and bondsmen such as thou, but becomes Beef, a  fiery French gallant, when he arrives before the worshipful jaws that are  destined to consume him. Mynheer Calf, too, becomes Monsieur de Veau in the  like manner; he is Saxon when he requires tendance, and takes a Norman name  when he becomes matter of enjoyment.&rdquo;          &ldquo;By St Dunstan,&rdquo; answered Gurth, &ldquo;thou speakest but sad  truths; little is left to us but the air we breathe, and that appears to have  been reserved with much hesitation, solely for the purpose of enabling us to  endure the tasks they lay upon our shoulders. The finest and the fattest is for  their board; the loveliest is for their couch; the best and bravest supply  their foreign masters with soldiers, and whiten distant lands with their bones,  leaving few here who have either will or the power to protect the unfortunate  Saxon. God&rsquo;s blessing on our master Cedric, he hath done the work of a  man in standing in the gap; but Reginald Front-de-Bœuf is coming down to this  country in person, and we shall soon see how little Cedric&rsquo;s trouble will  avail him.&mdash;Here, here,&rdquo; he exclaimed again, raising his voice,  &ldquo;So ho! so ho! well done, Fangs! thou hast them all before thee now, and  bring&rsquo;st them on bravely, lad.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Gurth,&rdquo; said the Jester, &ldquo;I know thou thinkest me a fool, or  thou wouldst not be so rash in putting thy head into my mouth. One word to  Reginald Front-de-Bœuf, or Philip de Malvoisin, that thou hast spoken treason  against the Norman,&mdash;and thou art but a cast-away swineherd,&mdash;thou  wouldst waver on one of these trees as a terror to all evil speakers against  dignities.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Dog, thou wouldst not betray me,&rdquo; said Gurth, &ldquo;after having  led me on to speak so much at disadvantage?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Betray thee!&rdquo; answered the Jester; &ldquo;no, that were the trick  of a wise man; a fool cannot half so well help himself&mdash;but soft, whom  have we here?&rdquo; he said, listening to the trampling of several horses  which became then audible.          &ldquo;Never mind whom,&rdquo; answered Gurth, who had now got his herd before  him, and, with the aid of Fangs, was driving them down one of the long dim  vistas which we have endeavoured to describe.          &ldquo;Nay, but I must see the riders,&rdquo; answered Wamba; &ldquo;perhaps  they are come from Fairy-land with a message from King Oberon.&rdquo;          &ldquo;A murrain take thee,&rdquo; rejoined the swine-herd; &ldquo;wilt thou  talk of such things, while a terrible storm of thunder and lightning is raging  within a few miles of us? Hark, how the thunder rumbles! and for summer rain, I  never saw such broad downright flat drops fall out of the clouds; the oaks,  too, notwithstanding the calm weather, sob and creak with their great boughs as  if announcing a tempest. Thou canst play the rational if thou wilt; credit me  for once, and let us home ere the storm begins to rage, for the night will be  fearful.&rdquo;          Wamba seemed to feel the force of this appeal, and accompanied his companion,  who began his journey after catching up a long quarter-staff which lay upon the  grass beside him. This second Eumaeus strode hastily down the forest glade,  driving before him, with the assistance of Fangs, the whole herd of his  inharmonious charge.                     CHAPTER II        A Monk there was, a fayre for the maistrie,   An outrider that loved venerie;   A manly man, to be an Abbot able,   Full many a daintie horse had he in stable:   And whan he rode, men might his bridle hear   Gingeling in a whistling wind as clear,   And eke as loud, as doth the chapell bell,   There as this lord was keeper of the cell.          C HAUCER           Notwithstanding the occasional exhortation and chiding of his companion, the  noise of the horsemen&rsquo;s feet continuing to approach, Wamba could not be  prevented from lingering occasionally on the road, upon every pretence which  occurred; now catching from the hazel a cluster of half-ripe nuts, and now  turning his head to leer after a cottage maiden who crossed their path. The  horsemen, therefore, soon overtook them on the road.          Their numbers amounted to ten men, of whom the two who rode foremost seemed to  be persons of considerable importance, and the others their attendants. It was  not difficult to ascertain the condition and character of one of these  personages. He was obviously an ecclesiastic of high rank; his dress was that  of a Cistercian Monk, but composed of materials much finer than those which the  rule of that order admitted. His mantle and hood were of the best Flanders  cloth, and fell in ample, and not ungraceful folds, around a handsome, though  somewhat corpulent person. His countenance bore as little the marks of  self-denial, as his habit indicated contempt of worldly splendour. His features  might have been called good, had there not lurked under the pent-house of his  eye, that sly epicurean twinkle which indicates the cautious voluptuary. In  other respects, his profession and situation had taught him a ready command  over his countenance, which he could contract at pleasure into solemnity,  although its natural expression was that of good-humoured social indulgence. In  defiance of conventual rules, and the edicts of popes and councils, the sleeves  of this dignitary were lined and turned up with rich furs, his mantle secured  at the throat with a golden clasp, and the whole dress proper to his order as  much refined upon and ornamented, as that of a quaker beauty of the present  day, who, while she retains the garb and costume of her sect continues to give  to its simplicity, by the choice of materials and the mode of disposing them, a  certain air of coquettish attraction, savouring but too much of the vanities of  the world.          This worthy churchman rode upon a well-fed ambling mule, whose furniture was  highly decorated, and whose bridle, according to the fashion of the day, was  ornamented with silver bells. In his seat he had nothing of the awkwardness of  the convent, but displayed the easy and habitual grace of a well-trained  horseman. Indeed, it seemed that so humble a conveyance as a mule, in however  good case, and however well broken to a pleasant and accommodating amble, was  only used by the gallant monk for travelling on the road. A lay brother, one of  those who followed in the train, had, for his use on other occasions, one of  the most handsome Spanish jennets ever bred at Andalusia, which merchants used  at that time to import, with great trouble and risk, for the use of persons of  wealth and distinction. The saddle and housings of this superb palfrey were  covered by a long foot-cloth, which reached nearly to the ground, and on which  were richly embroidered, mitres, crosses, and other ecclesiastical emblems.  Another lay brother led a sumpter mule, loaded probably with his  superior&rsquo;s baggage; and two monks of his own order, of inferior station,  rode together in the rear, laughing and conversing with each other, without  taking much notice of the other members of the cavalcade.          The companion of the church dignitary was a man past forty, thin, strong, tall,  and muscular; an athletic figure, which long fatigue and constant exercise  seemed to have left none of the softer part of the human form, having reduced  the whole to brawn, bones, and sinews, which had sustained a thousand toils,  and were ready to dare a thousand more. His head was covered with a scarlet  cap, faced with fur&mdash;of that kind which the French call  &ldquo;mortier&rdquo;, from its resemblance to the shape of an inverted mortar.  His countenance was therefore fully displayed, and its expression was  calculated to impress a degree of awe, if not of fear, upon strangers. High  features, naturally strong and powerfully expressive, had been burnt almost  into Negro blackness by constant exposure to the tropical sun, and might, in  their ordinary state, be said to slumber after the storm of passion had passed  away; but the projection of the veins of the forehead, the readiness with which  the upper lip and its thick black moustaches quivered upon the slightest  emotion, plainly intimated that the tempest might be again and easily awakened.  His keen, piercing, dark eyes, told in every glance a history of difficulties  subdued, and dangers dared, and seemed to challenge opposition to his wishes,  for the pleasure of sweeping it from his road by a determined exertion of  courage and of will; a deep scar on his brow gave additional sternness to his  countenance, and a sinister expression to one of his eyes, which had been  slightly injured on the same occasion, and of which the vision, though perfect,  was in a slight and partial degree distorted.          The upper dress of this personage resembled that of his companion in shape,  being a long monastic mantle; but the colour, being scarlet, showed that he did  not belong to any of the four regular orders of monks. On the right shoulder of  the mantle there was cut, in white cloth, a cross of a peculiar form. This  upper robe concealed what at first view seemed rather inconsistent with its  form, a shirt, namely, of linked mail, with sleeves and gloves of the same,  curiously plaited and interwoven, as flexible to the body as those which are  now wrought in the stocking-loom, out of less obdurate materials. The fore-part  of his thighs, where the folds of his mantle permitted them to be seen, were  also covered with linked mail; the knees and feet were defended by splints, or  thin plates of steel, ingeniously jointed upon each other; and mail hose,  reaching from the ankle to the knee, effectually protected the legs, and  completed the rider&rsquo;s defensive armour. In his girdle he wore a long and  double-edged dagger, which was the only offensive weapon about his person.          He rode, not a mule, like his companion, but a strong hackney for the road, to  save his gallant war-horse, which a squire led behind, fully accoutred for  battle, with a chamfron or plaited head-piece upon his head, having a short  spike projecting from the front. On one side of the saddle hung a short  battle-axe, richly inlaid with Damascene carving; on the other the  rider&rsquo;s plumed head-piece and hood of mail, with a long two-handed sword,  used by the chivalry of the period. A second squire held aloft his  master&rsquo;s lance, from the extremity of which fluttered a small banderole,  or streamer, bearing a cross of the same form with that embroidered upon his  cloak. He also carried his small triangular shield, broad enough at the top to  protect the breast, and from thence diminishing to a point. It was covered with  a scarlet cloth, which prevented the device from being seen.          These two squires were followed by two attendants, whose dark visages, white  turbans, and the Oriental form of their garments, showed them to be natives of  some distant Eastern country.   9            The whole appearance of this warrior and his retinue was wild and outlandish;  the dress of his squires was gorgeous, and his Eastern attendants wore silver  collars round their throats, and bracelets of the same metal upon their swarthy  arms and legs, of which the former were naked from the elbow, and the latter  from mid-leg to ankle. Silk and embroidery distinguished their dresses, and  marked the wealth and importance of their master; forming, at the same time, a  striking contrast with the martial simplicity of his own attire. They were  armed with crooked sabres, having the hilt and baldric inlaid with gold, and  matched with Turkish daggers of yet more costly workmanship. Each of them bore  at his saddle-bow a bundle of darts or javelins, about four feet in length,  having sharp steel heads, a weapon much in use among the Saracens, and of which  the memory is yet preserved in the martial exercise called &ldquo;El  Jerrid&rdquo;, still practised in the Eastern countries.          The steeds of these attendants were in appearance as foreign as their riders.  They were of Saracen origin, and consequently of Arabian descent; and their  fine slender limbs, small fetlocks, thin manes, and easy springy motion, formed  a marked contrast with the large-jointed, heavy horses, of which the race was  cultivated in Flanders and in Normandy, for mounting the men-at-arms of the  period in all the panoply of plate and mail; and which, placed by the side of  those Eastern coursers, might have passed for a personification of substance  and of shadow.          The singular appearance of this cavalcade not only attracted the curiosity of  Wamba, but excited even that of his less volatile companion. The monk he  instantly knew to be the Prior of Jorvaulx Abbey, well known for many miles  around as a lover of the chase, of the banquet, and, if fame did him not wrong,  of other worldly pleasures still more inconsistent with his monastic vows.          Yet so loose were the ideas of the times respecting the conduct of the clergy,  whether secular or regular, that the Prior Aymer maintained a fair character in  the neighbourhood of his abbey. His free and jovial temper, and the readiness  with which he granted absolution from all ordinary delinquencies, rendered him  a favourite among the nobility and principal gentry, to several of whom he was  allied by birth, being of a distinguished Norman family. The ladies, in  particular, were not disposed to scan too nicely the morals of a man who was a  professed admirer of their sex, and who possessed many means of dispelling the  ennui which was too apt to intrude upon the halls and bowers of an ancient  feudal castle. The Prior mingled in the sports of the field with more than due  eagerness, and was allowed to possess the best-trained hawks, and the fleetest  greyhounds in the North Riding; circumstances which strongly recommended him to  the youthful gentry. With the old, he had another part to play, which, when  needful, he could sustain with great decorum. His knowledge of books, however  superficial, was sufficient to impress upon their ignorance respect for his  supposed learning; and the gravity of his deportment and language, with the  high tone which he exerted in setting forth the authority of the church and of  the priesthood, impressed them no less with an opinion of his sanctity. Even  the common people, the severest critics of the conduct of their betters, had  commiseration with the follies of Prior Aymer. He was generous; and charity, as  it is well known, covereth a multitude of sins, in another sense than that in  which it is said to do so in Scripture. The revenues of the monastery, of which  a large part was at his disposal, while they gave him the means of supplying  his own very considerable expenses, afforded also those largesses which he  bestowed among the peasantry, and with which he frequently relieved the  distresses of the oppressed. If Prior Aymer rode hard in the chase, or remained  long at the banquet,&mdash;if Prior Aymer was seen, at the early peep of dawn,  to enter the postern of the abbey, as he glided home from some rendezvous which  had occupied the hours of darkness, men only shrugged up their shoulders, and  reconciled themselves to his irregularities, by recollecting that the same were  practised by many of his brethren who had no redeeming qualities whatsoever to  atone for them. Prior Aymer, therefore, and his character, were well known to  our Saxon serfs, who made their rude obeisance, and received his  &ldquo;benedicite, mes filz,&rdquo; in return.          But the singular appearance of his companion and his attendants, arrested their  attention and excited their wonder, and they could scarcely attend to the Prior  of Jorvaulx&rsquo; question, when he demanded if they knew of any place of  harbourage in the vicinity; so much were they surprised at the half monastic,  half military appearance of the swarthy stranger, and at the uncouth dress and  arms of his Eastern attendants. It is probable, too, that the language in which  the benediction was conferred, and the information asked, sounded ungracious,  though not probably unintelligible, in the ears of the Saxon peasants.          &ldquo;I asked you, my children,&rdquo; said the Prior, raising his voice, and  using the lingua Franca, or mixed language, in which the Norman and Saxon races  conversed with each other, &ldquo;if there be in this neighbourhood any good  man, who, for the love of God, and devotion to Mother Church, will give two of  her humblest servants, with their train, a night&rsquo;s hospitality and  refreshment?&rdquo;          This he spoke with a tone of conscious importance, which formed a strong  contrast to the modest terms which he thought it proper to employ.          &ldquo;Two of the humblest servants of Mother Church!&rdquo; repeated Wamba to  himself,&mdash;but, fool as he was, taking care not to make his observation  audible; &ldquo;I should like to see her seneschals, her chief butlers, and  other principal domestics!&rdquo;          After this internal commentary on the Prior&rsquo;s speech, he raised his eyes,  and replied to the question which had been put.          &ldquo;If the reverend fathers,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;loved good cheer and  soft lodging, few miles of riding would carry them to the Priory of Brinxworth,  where their quality could not but secure them the most honourable reception; or  if they preferred spending a penitential evening, they might turn down yonder  wild glade, which would bring them to the hermitage of Copmanhurst, where a  pious anchoret would make them sharers for the night of the shelter of his roof  and the benefit of his prayers.&rdquo;          The Prior shook his head at both proposals.          &ldquo;Mine honest friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if the jangling of thy bells  had not dizzied thine understanding, thou mightst know &ldquo;Clericus clericum  non decimat&rdquo;; that is to say, we churchmen do not exhaust each  other&rsquo;s hospitality, but rather require that of the laity, giving them  thus an opportunity to serve God in honouring and relieving his appointed  servants.&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; replied Wamba, &ldquo;that I, being but an ass, am,  nevertheless, honoured to hear the bells as well as your reverence&rsquo;s  mule; notwithstanding, I did conceive that the charity of Mother Church and her  servants might be said, with other charity, to begin at home.&rdquo;          &ldquo;A truce to thine insolence, fellow,&rdquo; said the armed rider,  breaking in on his prattle with a high and stern voice, &ldquo;and tell us, if  thou canst, the road to&mdash;How call&rsquo;d you your Franklin, Prior  Aymer?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Cedric,&rdquo; answered the Prior; &ldquo;Cedric the Saxon.&mdash;Tell  me, good fellow, are we near his dwelling, and can you show us the road?&rdquo;          &ldquo;The road will be uneasy to find,&rdquo; answered Gurth, who broke  silence for the first time, &ldquo;and the family of Cedric retire early to  rest.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Tush, tell not me, fellow,&rdquo; said the military rider;  &ldquo;&rsquo;tis easy for them to arise and supply the wants of travellers  such as we are, who will not stoop to beg the hospitality which we have a right  to command.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I know not,&rdquo; said Gurth, sullenly, &ldquo;if I should show the way  to my master&rsquo;s house, to those who demand as a right, the shelter which  most are fain to ask as a favour.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Do you dispute with me, slave!&rdquo; said the soldier; and, setting  spurs to his horse, he caused him make a demivolte across the path, raising at  the same time the riding rod which he held in his hand, with a purpose of  chastising what he considered as the insolence of the peasant.          Gurth darted at him a savage and revengeful scowl, and with a fierce, yet  hesitating motion, laid his hand on the haft of his knife; but the interference  of Prior Aymer, who pushed his mule betwixt his companion and the swineherd,  prevented the meditated violence.          &ldquo;Nay, by St Mary, brother Brian, you must not think you are now in  Palestine, predominating over heathen Turks and infidel Saracens; we islanders  love not blows, save those of holy Church, who chasteneth whom she  loveth.&mdash;Tell me, good fellow,&rdquo; said he to Wamba, and seconded his  speech by a small piece of silver coin, &ldquo;the way to Cedric the  Saxon&rsquo;s; you cannot be ignorant of it, and it is your duty to direct the  wanderer even when his character is less sanctified than ours.&rdquo;          &ldquo;In truth, venerable father,&rdquo; answered the Jester, &ldquo;the  Saracen head of your right reverend companion has frightened out of mine the  way home&mdash;I am not sure I shall get there to-night myself.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Tush,&rdquo; said the Abbot, &ldquo;thou canst tell us if thou wilt.  This reverend brother has been all his life engaged in fighting among the  Saracens for the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre; he is of the order of Knights  Templars, whom you may have heard of; he is half a monk, half a soldier.&rdquo;          &ldquo;If he is but half a monk,&rdquo; said the Jester, &ldquo;he should not  be wholly unreasonable with those whom he meets upon the road, even if they  should be in no hurry to answer questions that no way concern them.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I forgive thy wit,&rdquo; replied the Abbot, &ldquo;on condition thou  wilt show me the way to Cedric&rsquo;s mansion.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; answered Wamba, &ldquo;your reverences must hold on  this path till you come to a sunken cross, of which scarce a cubit&rsquo;s  length remains above ground; then take the path to the left, for there are four  which meet at Sunken Cross, and I trust your reverences will obtain shelter  before the storm comes on.&rdquo;                      The Abbot thanked his sage adviser; and the cavalcade, setting spurs to their  horses, rode on as men do who wish to reach their inn before the bursting of a  night-storm. As their horses&rsquo; hoofs died away, Gurth said to his  companion, &ldquo;If they follow thy wise direction, the reverend fathers will  hardly reach Rotherwood this night.&rdquo;          &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Jester, grinning, &ldquo;but they may reach  Sheffield if they have good luck, and that is as fit a place for them. I am not  so bad a woodsman as to show the dog where the deer lies, if I have no mind he  should chase him.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou art right,&rdquo; said Gurth; &ldquo;it were ill that Aymer saw the  Lady Rowena; and it were worse, it may be, for Cedric to quarrel, as is most  likely he would, with this military monk. But, like good servants let us hear  and see, and say nothing.&rdquo;          We return to the riders, who had soon left the bondsmen far behind them, and  who maintained the following conversation in the Norman-French language,  usually employed by the superior classes, with the exception of the few who  were still inclined to boast their Saxon descent.          &ldquo;What mean these fellows by their capricious insolence?&rdquo; said the  Templar to the Benedictine, &ldquo;and why did you prevent me from chastising  it?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Marry, brother Brian,&rdquo; replied the Prior, &ldquo;touching the one  of them, it were hard for me to render a reason for a fool speaking according  to his folly; and the other churl is of that savage, fierce, intractable race,  some of whom, as I have often told you, are still to be found among the  descendants of the conquered Saxons, and whose supreme pleasure it is to  testify, by all means in their power, their aversion to their  conquerors.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I would soon have beat him into courtesy,&rdquo; observed Brian;  &ldquo;I am accustomed to deal with such spirits: Our Turkish captives are as  fierce and intractable as Odin himself could have been; yet two months in my  household, under the management of my master of the slaves, has made them  humble, submissive, serviceable, and observant of your will. Marry, sir, you  must be aware of the poison and the dagger; for they use either with free will  when you give them the slightest opportunity.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay, but,&rdquo; answered Prior Aymer, &ldquo;every land has its own  manners and fashions; and, besides that beating this fellow could procure us no  information respecting the road to Cedric&rsquo;s house, it would have been  sure to have established a quarrel betwixt you and him had we found our way  thither. Remember what I told you: this wealthy franklin is proud, fierce,  jealous, and irritable, a withstander of the nobility, and even of his  neighbors, Reginald Front-de-Bœuf and Philip Malvoisin, who are no babies to  strive with. He stands up sternly for the privileges of his race, and is so  proud of his uninterrupted descend from Hereward, a renowned champion of the  Heptarchy, that he is universally called Cedric the Saxon; and makes a boast of  his belonging to a people from whom many others endeaver to hide their descent,  lest they should encounter a share of the &lsquo;vae victis,&rsquo; or  severities imposed upon the vanquished.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Prior Aymer,&rdquo; said the Templar, &ldquo;you are a man of gallantry,  learned in the study of beauty, and as expert as a troubadour in all matters  concerning the &lsquo;arrets&rsquo; of love; but I shall expect much beauty in  this celebrated Rowena to counterbalance the self-denial and forbearance which  I must exert if I am to court the favor of such a seditious churl as you have  described her father Cedric.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Cedric is not her father,&rdquo; replied the Prior, &ldquo;and is but of  remote relation: she is descended from higher blood than even he pretends to,  and is but distantly connected with him by birth. Her guardian, however, he is,  self-constituted as I believe; but his ward is as dear to him as if she were  his own child. Of her beauty you shall soon be judge; and if the purity of her  complexion, and the majestic, yet soft expression of a mild blue eye, do not  chase from your memory the black-tressed girls of Palestine, ay, or the houris  of old Mahound&rsquo;s paradise, I am an infidel, and no true son of the  church.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Should your boasted beauty,&rdquo; said the Templar, &ldquo;be weighed  in the balance and found wanting, you know our wager?&rdquo;          &ldquo;My gold collar,&rdquo; answered the Prior, &ldquo;against ten butts of  Chian wine;&mdash;they are mine as securely as if they were already in the  convent vaults, under the key of old Dennis the cellarer.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And I am myself to be judge,&rdquo; said the Templar, &ldquo;and am only  to be convicted on my own admission, that I have seen no maiden so beautiful  since Pentecost was a twelvemonth. Ran it not so?&mdash;Prior, your collar is  in danger; I will wear it over my gorget in the lists of  Ashby-de-la-Zouche.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Win it fairly,&rdquo; said the Prior, &ldquo;and wear it as ye will; I  will trust your giving true response, on your word as a knight and as a  churchman. Yet, brother, take my advice, and file your tongue to a little more  courtesy than your habits of predominating over infidel captives and Eastern  bondsmen have accustomed you. Cedric the Saxon, if offended,&mdash;and he is  noway slack in taking offence,&mdash;is a man who, without respect to your  knighthood, my high office, or the sanctity of either, would clear his house of  us, and send us to lodge with the larks, though the hour were midnight. And be  careful how you look on Rowena, whom he cherishes with the most jealous care;  an he take the least alarm in that quarter we are but lost men. It is said he  banished his only son from his family for lifting his eyes in the way of  affection towards this beauty, who may be worshipped, it seems, at a distance,  but is not to be approached with other thoughts than such as we bring to the  shrine of the Blessed Virgin.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Well, you have said enough,&rdquo; answered the Templar; &ldquo;I will  for a night put on the needful restraint, and deport me as meekly as a maiden;  but as for the fear of his expelling us by violence, myself and squires, with  Hamet and Abdalla, will warrant you against that disgrace. Doubt not that we  shall be strong enough to make good our quarters.&rdquo;          &ldquo;We must not let it come so far,&rdquo; answered the Prior; &ldquo;but  here is the clown&rsquo;s sunken cross, and the night is so dark that we can  hardly see which of the roads we are to follow. He bid us turn, I think to the  left.&rdquo;          &ldquo;To the right,&rdquo; said Brian, &ldquo;to the best of my  remembrance.&rdquo;          &ldquo;To the left, certainly, the left; I remember his pointing with his  wooden sword.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay, but he held his sword in his left hand, and so pointed across his  body with it,&rdquo; said the Templar.          Each maintained his opinion with sufficient obstinacy, as is usual in all such  cases; the attendants were appealed to, but they had not been near enough to  hear Wamba&rsquo;s directions. At length Brian remarked, what had at first  escaped him in the twilight; &ldquo;Here is some one either asleep, or lying  dead at the foot of this cross&mdash;Hugo, stir him with the butt-end of thy  lance.&rdquo;          This was no sooner done than the figure arose, exclaiming in good French,  &ldquo;Whosoever thou art, it is discourteous in you to disturb my  thoughts.&rdquo;          &ldquo;We did but wish to ask you,&rdquo; said the Prior, &ldquo;the road to  Rotherwood, the abode of Cedric the Saxon.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I myself am bound thither,&rdquo; replied the stranger; &ldquo;and if I  had a horse, I would be your guide, for the way is somewhat intricate, though  perfectly well known to me.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou shalt have both thanks and reward, my friend,&rdquo; said the  Prior, &ldquo;if thou wilt bring us to Cedric&rsquo;s in safety.&rdquo;          And he caused one of his attendants to mount his own led horse, and give that  upon which he had hitherto ridden to the stranger, who was to serve for a  guide.          Their conductor pursued an opposite road from that which Wamba had recommended,  for the purpose of misleading them. The path soon led deeper into the woodland,  and crossed more than one brook, the approach to which was rendered perilous by  the marshes through which it flowed; but the stranger seemed to know, as if by  instinct, the soundest ground and the safest points of passage; and by dint of  caution and attention, brought the party safely into a wilder avenue than any  they had yet seen; and, pointing to a large low irregular building at the upper  extremity, he said to the Prior, &ldquo;Yonder is Rotherwood, the dwelling of  Cedric the Saxon.&rdquo;          This was a joyful intimation to Aymer, whose nerves were none of the strongest,  and who had suffered such agitation and alarm in the course of passing through  the dangerous bogs, that he had not yet had the curiosity to ask his guide a  single question. Finding himself now at his ease and near shelter, his  curiosity began to awake, and he demanded of the guide who and what he was.          &ldquo;A Palmer, just returned from the Holy Land,&rdquo; was the answer.          &ldquo;You had better have tarried there to fight for the recovery of the Holy  Sepulchre,&rdquo; said the Templar.          &ldquo;True, Reverend Sir Knight,&rdquo; answered the Palmer, to whom the  appearance of the Templar seemed perfectly familiar; &ldquo;but when those who  are under oath to recover the holy city, are found travelling at such a  distance from the scene of their duties, can you wonder that a peaceful peasant  like me should decline the task which they have abandoned?&rdquo;          The Templar would have made an angry reply, but was interrupted by the Prior,  who again expressed his astonishment, that their guide, after such long  absence, should be so perfectly acquainted with the passes of the forest.          &ldquo;I was born a native of these parts,&rdquo; answered their guide, and as  he made the reply they stood before the mansion of Cedric;&mdash;a low  irregular building, containing several court-yards or enclosures, extending  over a considerable space of ground, and which, though its size argued the  inhabitant to be a person of wealth, differed entirely from the tall,  turretted, and castellated buildings in which the Norman nobility resided, and  which had become the universal style of architecture throughout England.          Rotherwood was not, however, without defences; no habitation, in that disturbed  period, could have been so, without the risk of being plundered and burnt  before the next morning. A deep fosse, or ditch, was drawn round the whole  building, and filled with water from a neighbouring stream. A double stockade,  or palisade, composed of pointed beams, which the adjacent forest supplied,  defended the outer and inner bank of the trench. There was an entrance from the  west through the outer stockade, which communicated by a drawbridge, with a  similar opening in the interior defences. Some precautions had been taken to  place those entrances under the protection of projecting angles, by which they  might be flanked in case of need by archers or slingers.          Before this entrance the Templar wound his horn loudly; for the rain, which had  long threatened, began now to descend with great violence.                     CHAPTER III        Then (sad relief!) from the bleak coast that hears   The German Ocean roar, deep-blooming, strong,   And yellow hair&rsquo;d, the blue-eyed Saxon came.          T HOMSON&rsquo;S  L IBERTY           In a hall, the height of which was greatly disproportioned to its extreme  length and width, a long oaken table, formed of planks rough-hewn from the  forest, and which had scarcely received any polish, stood ready prepared for  the evening meal of Cedric the Saxon. The roof, composed of beams and rafters,  had nothing to divide the apartment from the sky excepting the planking and  thatch; there was a huge fireplace at either end of the hall, but as the  chimneys were constructed in a very clumsy manner, at least as much of the  smoke found its way into the apartment as escaped by the proper vent. The  constant vapour which this occasioned, had polished the rafters and beams of  the low-browed hall, by encrusting them with a black varnish of soot. On the  sides of the apartment hung implements of war and of the chase, and there were  at each corner folding doors, which gave access to other parts of the extensive  building.          The other appointments of the mansion partook of the rude simplicity of the  Saxon period, which Cedric piqued himself upon maintaining. The floor was  composed of earth mixed with lime, trodden into a hard substance, such as is  often employed in flooring our modern barns. For about one quarter of the  length of the apartment, the floor was raised by a step, and this space, which  was called the dais, was occupied only by the principal members of the family,  and visitors of distinction. For this purpose, a table richly covered with  scarlet cloth was placed transversely across the platform, from the middle of  which ran the longer and lower board, at which the domestics and inferior  persons fed, down towards the bottom of the hall. The whole resembled the form  of the letter T, or some of those ancient dinner-tables, which, arranged on the  same principles, may be still seen in the antique Colleges of Oxford or  Cambridge. Massive chairs and settles of carved oak were placed upon the dais,  and over these seats and the more elevated table was fastened a canopy of  cloth, which served in some degree to protect the dignitaries who occupied that  distinguished station from the weather, and especially from the rain, which in  some places found its way through the ill-constructed roof.          The walls of this upper end of the hall, as far as the dais extended, were  covered with hangings or curtains, and upon the floor there was a carpet, both  of which were adorned with some attempts at tapestry, or embroidery, executed  with brilliant or rather gaudy colouring. Over the lower range of table, the  roof, as we have noticed, had no covering; the rough plastered walls were left  bare, and the rude earthen floor was uncarpeted; the board was uncovered by a  cloth, and rude massive benches supplied the place of chairs.          In the centre of the upper table, were placed two chairs more elevated than the  rest, for the master and mistress of the family, who presided over the scene of  hospitality, and from doing so derived their Saxon title of honour, which  signifies &ldquo;the Dividers of Bread.&rdquo;          To each of these chairs was added a footstool, curiously carved and inlaid with  ivory, which mark of distinction was peculiar to them. One of these seats was  at present occupied by Cedric the Saxon, who, though but in rank a thane, or,  as the Normans called him, a Franklin, felt, at the delay of his evening meal,  an irritable impatience, which might have become an alderman, whether of  ancient or of modern times.          It appeared, indeed, from the countenance of this proprietor, that he was of a  frank, but hasty and choleric temper. He was not above the middle stature, but  broad-shouldered, long-armed, and powerfully made, like one accustomed to  endure the fatigue of war or of the chase; his face was broad, with large blue  eyes, open and frank features, fine teeth, and a well formed head, altogether  expressive of that sort of good-humour which often lodges with a sudden and  hasty temper. Pride and jealousy there was in his eye, for his life had been  spent in asserting rights which were constantly liable to invasion; and the  prompt, fiery, and resolute disposition of the man, had been kept constantly  upon the alert by the circumstances of his situation. His long yellow hair was  equally divided on the top of his head and upon his brow, and combed down on  each side to the length of his shoulders; it had but little tendency to grey,  although Cedric was approaching to his sixtieth year.          His dress was a tunic of forest green, furred at the throat and cuffs with what  was called minever; a kind of fur inferior in quality to ermine, and formed, it  is believed, of the skin of the grey squirrel. This doublet hung unbuttoned  over a close dress of scarlet which sat tight to his body; he had breeches of  the same, but they did not reach below the lower part of the thigh, leaving the  knee exposed. His feet had sandals of the same fashion with the peasants, but  of finer materials, and secured in the front with golden clasps. He had  bracelets of gold upon his arms, and a broad collar of the same precious metal  around his neck. About his waist he wore a richly-studded belt, in which was  stuck a short straight two-edged sword, with a sharp point, so disposed as to  hang almost perpendicularly by his side. Behind his seat was hung a scarlet  cloth cloak lined with fur, and a cap of the same materials richly embroidered,  which completed the dress of the opulent landholder when he chose to go forth.  A short boar-spear, with a broad and bright steel head, also reclined against  the back of his chair, which served him, when he walked abroad, for the  purposes of a staff or of a weapon, as chance might require.          Several domestics, whose dress held various proportions betwixt the richness of  their master&rsquo;s, and the coarse and simple attire of Gurth the swine-herd,  watched the looks and waited the commands of the Saxon dignitary. Two or three  servants of a superior order stood behind their master upon the dais; the rest  occupied the lower part of the hall. Other attendants there were of a different  description; two or three large and shaggy greyhounds, such as were then  employed in hunting the stag and wolf; as many slow-hounds of a large bony  breed, with thick necks, large heads, and long ears; and one or two of the  smaller dogs, now called terriers, which waited with impatience the arrival of  the supper; but, with the sagacious knowledge of physiognomy peculiar to their  race, forbore to intrude upon the moody silence of their master, apprehensive  probably of a small white truncheon which lay by Cedric&rsquo;s trencher, for  the purpose of repelling the advances of his four-legged dependants. One grisly  old wolf-dog alone, with the liberty of an indulged favourite, had planted  himself close by the chair of state, and occasionally ventured to solicit  notice by putting his large hairy head upon his master&rsquo;s knee, or pushing  his nose into his hand. Even he was repelled by the stern command, &ldquo;Down,  Balder, down! I am not in the humour for foolery.&rdquo;          In fact, Cedric, as we have observed, was in no very placid state of mind. The  Lady Rowena, who had been absent to attend an evening mass at a distant church,  had but just returned, and was changing her garments, which had been wetted by  the storm. There were as yet no tidings of Gurth and his charge, which should  long since have been driven home from the forest and such was the insecurity of  the period, as to render it probable that the delay might be explained by some  depreciation of the outlaws, with whom the adjacent forest abounded, or by the  violence of some neighbouring baron, whose consciousness of strength made him  equally negligent of the laws of property. The matter was of consequence, for  great part of the domestic wealth of the Saxon proprietors consisted in  numerous herds of swine, especially in forest-land, where those animals easily  found their food.          Besides these subjects of anxiety, the Saxon thane was impatient for the  presence of his favourite clown Wamba, whose jests, such as they were, served  for a sort of seasoning to his evening meal, and to the deep draughts of ale  and wine with which he was in the habit of accompanying it. Add to all this,  Cedric had fasted since noon, and his usual supper hour was long past, a cause  of irritation common to country squires, both in ancient and modern times. His  displeasure was expressed in broken sentences, partly muttered to himself,  partly addressed to the domestics who stood around; and particularly to his  cupbearer, who offered him from time to time, as a sedative, a silver goblet  filled with wine&mdash;&ldquo;Why tarries the Lady Rowena?&rdquo;          &ldquo;She is but changing her head-gear,&rdquo; replied a female attendant,  with as much confidence as the favourite lady&rsquo;s-maid usually answers the  master of a modern family; &ldquo;you would not wish her to sit down to the  banquet in her hood and kirtle? and no lady within the shire can be quicker in  arraying herself than my mistress.&rdquo;          This undeniable argument produced a sort of acquiescent umph! on the part of  the Saxon, with the addition, &ldquo;I wish her devotion may choose fair  weather for the next visit to St John&rsquo;s Kirk;&mdash;but what, in the name  of ten devils,&rdquo; continued he, turning to the cupbearer, and raising his  voice as if happy to have found a channel into which he might divert his  indignation without fear or control&mdash;&ldquo;what, in the name of ten  devils, keeps Gurth so long afield? I suppose we shall have an evil account of  the herd; he was wont to be a faithful and cautious drudge, and I had destined  him for something better; perchance I might even have made him one of my  warders.&rdquo;   11            Oswald the cupbearer modestly suggested, &ldquo;that it was scarce an hour  since the tolling of the curfew;&rdquo; an ill-chosen apology, since it turned  upon a topic so harsh to Saxon ears.          &ldquo;The foul fiend,&rdquo; exclaimed Cedric, &ldquo;take the curfew-bell,  and the tyrannical bastard by whom it was devised, and the heartless slave who  names it with a Saxon tongue to a Saxon ear! The curfew!&rdquo; he added,  pausing, &ldquo;ay, the curfew; which compels true men to extinguish their  lights, that thieves and robbers may work their deeds in darkness!&mdash;Ay,  the curfew;&mdash;Reginald Front-de-Bœuf and Philip de Malvoisin know the use  of the curfew as well as William the Bastard himself, or e&rsquo;er a Norman  adventurer that fought at Hastings. I shall hear, I guess, that my property has  been swept off to save from starving the hungry banditti, whom they cannot  support but by theft and robbery. My faithful slave is murdered, and my goods  are taken for a prey&mdash;and Wamba&mdash;where is Wamba? Said not some one he  had gone forth with Gurth?&rdquo;          Oswald replied in the affirmative.          &ldquo;Ay? why this is better and better! he is carried off too, the Saxon  fool, to serve the Norman lord. Fools are we all indeed that serve them, and  fitter subjects for their scorn and laughter, than if we were born with but  half our wits. But I will be avenged,&rdquo; he added, starting from his chair  in impatience at the supposed injury, and catching hold of his boar-spear;  &ldquo;I will go with my complaint to the great council; I have friends, I have  followers&mdash;man to man will I appeal the Norman to the lists; let him come  in his plate and his mail, and all that can render cowardice bold; I have sent  such a javelin as this through a stronger fence than three of their war  shields!&mdash;Haply they think me old; but they shall find, alone and  childless as I am, the blood of Hereward is in the veins of Cedric.&mdash;Ah,  Wilfred, Wilfred!&rdquo; he exclaimed in a lower tone, &ldquo;couldst thou have  ruled thine unreasonable passion, thy father had not been left in his age like  the solitary oak that throws out its shattered and unprotected branches against  the full sweep of the tempest!&rdquo; The reflection seemed to conjure into  sadness his irritated feelings. Replacing his javelin, he resumed his seat,  bent his looks downward, and appeared to be absorbed in melancholy reflection.          From his musing, Cedric was suddenly awakened by the blast of a horn, which was  replied to by the clamorous yells and barking of all the dogs in the hall, and  some twenty or thirty which were quartered in other parts of the building. It  cost some exercise of the white truncheon, well seconded by the exertions of  the domestics, to silence this canine clamour.          &ldquo;To the gate, knaves!&rdquo; said the Saxon, hastily, as soon as the  tumult was so much appeased that the dependants could hear his voice.  &ldquo;See what tidings that horn tells us of&mdash;to announce, I ween, some  hership   12   and robbery which has been done upon  my lands.&rdquo;          Returning in less than three minutes, a warder announced &ldquo;that the Prior  Aymer of Jorvaulx, and the good knight Brian de Bois-Guilbert, commander of the  valiant and venerable order of Knights Templars, with a small retinue,  requested hospitality and lodging for the night, being on their way to a  tournament which was to be held not far from Ashby-de-la-Zouche, on the second  day from the present.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Aymer, the Prior Aymer? Brian de Bois-Guilbert?&rdquo;&mdash;muttered  Cedric; &ldquo;Normans both;&mdash;but Norman or Saxon, the hospitality of  Rotherwood must not be impeached; they are welcome, since they have chosen to  halt&mdash;more welcome would they have been to have ridden further on their  way&mdash;But it were unworthy to murmur for a night&rsquo;s lodging and a  night&rsquo;s food; in the quality of guests, at least, even Normans must  suppress their insolence.&mdash;Go, Hundebert,&rdquo; he added, to a sort of  major-domo who stood behind him with a white wand; &ldquo;take six of the  attendants, and introduce the strangers to the guests&rsquo; lodging. Look  after their horses and mules, and see their train lack nothing. Let them have  change of vestments if they require it, and fire, and water to wash, and wine  and ale; and bid the cooks add what they hastily can to our evening meal; and  let it be put on the board when those strangers are ready to share it. Say to  them, Hundebert, that Cedric would himself bid them welcome, but he is under a  vow never to step more than three steps from the dais of his own hall to meet  any who shares not the blood of Saxon royalty. Begone! see them carefully  tended; let them not say in their pride, the Saxon churl has shown at once his  poverty and his avarice.&rdquo;          The major-domo departed with several attendants, to execute his master&rsquo;s  commands.          &ldquo;The Prior Aymer!&rdquo; repeated Cedric, looking to Oswald, &ldquo;the  brother, if I mistake not, of Giles de Mauleverer, now lord of  Middleham?&rdquo;          Oswald made a respectful sign of assent. &ldquo;His brother sits in the seat,  and usurps the patrimony, of a better race, the race of Ulfgar of Middleham;  but what Norman lord doth not the same? This Prior is, they say, a free and  jovial priest, who loves the wine-cup and the bugle-horn better than bell and  book: Good; let him come, he shall be welcome. How named ye the Templar?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Brian de Bois-Guilbert.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Bois-Guilbert,&rdquo; said Cedric, still in the musing, half-arguing  tone, which the habit of living among dependants had accustomed him to employ,  and which resembled a man who talks to himself rather than to those around  him&mdash;&ldquo;Bois-Guilbert? that name has been spread wide both for good  and evil. They say he is valiant as the bravest of his order; but stained with  their usual vices, pride, arrogance, cruelty, and voluptuousness; a  hard-hearted man, who knows neither fear of earth, nor awe of heaven. So say  the few warriors who have returned from Palestine.&mdash;Well; it is but for  one night; he shall be welcome too.&mdash;Oswald, broach the oldest wine-cask;  place the best mead, the mightiest ale, the richest morat, the most sparkling  cider, the most odoriferous pigments, upon the board; fill the largest horns   13   &mdash;Templars and Abbots love good  wines and good measure.&mdash;Elgitha, let thy Lady Rowena, know we shall not  this night expect her in the hall, unless such be her especial pleasure.&rdquo;          &ldquo;But it will be her especial pleasure,&rdquo; answered Elgitha, with  great readiness, &ldquo;for she is ever desirous to hear the latest news from  Palestine.&rdquo;          Cedric darted at the forward damsel a glance of hasty resentment; but Rowena,  and whatever belonged to her, were privileged and secure from his anger. He  only replied, &ldquo;Silence, maiden; thy tongue outruns thy discretion. Say my  message to thy mistress, and let her do her pleasure. Here, at least, the  descendant of Alfred still reigns a princess.&rdquo; Elgitha left the  apartment.          &ldquo;Palestine!&rdquo; repeated the Saxon; &ldquo;Palestine! how many ears  are turned to the tales which dissolute crusaders, or hypocritical pilgrims,  bring from that fatal land! I too might ask&mdash;I too might enquire&mdash;I  too might listen with a beating heart to fables which the wily strollers devise  to cheat us into hospitality&mdash;but no&mdash;The son who has disobeyed me is  no longer mine; nor will I concern myself more for his fate than for that of  the most worthless among the millions that ever shaped the cross on their  shoulder, rushed into excess and blood-guiltiness, and called it an  accomplishment of the will of God.&rdquo;          He knit his brows, and fixed his eyes for an instant on the ground; as he  raised them, the folding doors at the bottom of the hall were cast wide, and,  preceded by the major-domo with his wand, and four domestics bearing blazing  torches, the guests of the evening entered the apartment.                     CHAPTER IV        With sheep and shaggy goats the porkers bled,   And the proud steer was on the marble spread;   With fire prepared, they deal the morsels round,   Wine rosy bright the brimming goblets crown&rsquo;d.               Disposed apart, Ulysses shares the treat;   A trivet table and ignobler seat,   The Prince assigns&mdash;          O DYSSEY ,  Book  XXI.          The Prior Aymer had taken the opportunity afforded him, of changing his riding  robe for one of yet more costly materials, over which he wore a cope curiously  embroidered. Besides the massive golden signet ring, which marked his  ecclesiastical dignity, his fingers, though contrary to the canon, were loaded  with precious gems; his sandals were of the finest leather which was imported  from Spain; his beard trimmed to as small dimensions as his order would  possibly permit, and his shaven crown concealed by a scarlet cap richly  embroidered.          The appearance of the Knight Templar was also changed; and, though less  studiously bedecked with ornament, his dress was as rich, and his appearance  far more commanding, than that of his companion. He had exchanged his shirt of  mail for an under tunic of dark purple silk, garnished with furs, over which  flowed his long robe of spotless white, in ample folds. The eight-pointed cross  of his order was cut on the shoulder of his mantle in black velvet. The high  cap no longer invested his brows, which were only shaded by short and thick  curled hair of a raven blackness, corresponding to his unusually swart  complexion. Nothing could be more gracefully majestic than his step and manner,  had they not been marked by a predominant air of haughtiness, easily acquired  by the exercise of unresisted authority.          These two dignified persons were followed by their respective attendants, and  at a more humble distance by their guide, whose figure had nothing more  remarkable than it derived from the usual weeds of a pilgrim. A cloak or mantle  of coarse black serge, enveloped his whole body. It was in shape something like  the cloak of a modern hussar, having similar flaps for covering the arms, and  was called a &ldquo;Sclaveyn&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Sclavonian&rdquo;. Coarse  sandals, bound with thongs, on his bare feet; a broad and shadowy hat, with  cockle-shells stitched on its brim, and a long staff shod with iron, to the  upper end of which was attached a branch of palm, completed the palmer&rsquo;s  attire. He followed modestly the last of the train which entered the hall, and,  observing that the lower table scarce afforded room sufficient for the  domestics of Cedric and the retinue of his guests, he withdrew to a settle  placed beside and almost under one of the large chimneys, and seemed to employ  himself in drying his garments, until the retreat of some one should make room  at the board, or the hospitality of the steward should supply him with  refreshments in the place he had chosen apart.          Cedric rose to receive his guests with an air of dignified hospitality, and,  descending from the dais, or elevated part of his hall, made three steps  towards them, and then awaited their approach.          &ldquo;I grieve,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;reverend Prior, that my vow binds me to  advance no farther upon this floor of my fathers, even to receive such guests  as you, and this valiant Knight of the Holy Temple. But my steward has  expounded to you the cause of my seeming discourtesy. Let me also pray, that  you will excuse my speaking to you in my native language, and that you will  reply in the same if your knowledge of it permits; if not, I sufficiently  understand Norman to follow your meaning.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Vows,&rdquo; said the Abbot, &ldquo;must be unloosed, worthy Franklin,  or permit me rather to say, worthy Thane, though the title is antiquated. Vows  are the knots which tie us to Heaven&mdash;they are the cords which bind the  sacrifice to the horns of the altar,&mdash;and are therefore,&mdash;as I said  before,&mdash;to be unloosened and discharged, unless our holy Mother Church  shall pronounce the contrary. And respecting language, I willingly hold  communication in that spoken by my respected grandmother, Hilda of Middleham,  who died in odour of sanctity, little short, if we may presume to say so, of  her glorious namesake, the blessed Saint Hilda of Whitby, God be gracious to  her soul!&rdquo;          When the Prior had ceased what he meant as a conciliatory harangue, his  companion said briefly and emphatically, &ldquo;I speak ever French, the  language of King Richard and his nobles; but I understand English sufficiently  to communicate with the natives of the country.&rdquo;          Cedric darted at the speaker one of those hasty and impatient glances, which  comparisons between the two rival nations seldom failed to call forth; but,  recollecting the duties of hospitality, he suppressed further show of  resentment, and, motioning with his hand, caused his guests to assume two seats  a little lower than his own, but placed close beside him, and gave a signal  that the evening meal should be placed upon the board.          While the attendants hastened to obey Cedric&rsquo;s commands, his eye  distinguished Gurth the swineherd, who, with his companion Wamba, had just  entered the hall. &ldquo;Send these loitering knaves up hither,&rdquo; said the  Saxon, impatiently. And when the culprits came before the  dais,&mdash;&ldquo;How comes it, villains! that you have loitered abroad so  late as this? Hast thou brought home thy charge, sirrah Gurth, or hast thou  left them to robbers and marauders?&rdquo;          &ldquo;The herd is safe, so please ye,&rdquo; said Gurth.          &ldquo;But it does not please me, thou knave,&rdquo; said Cedric, &ldquo;that I  should be made to suppose otherwise for two hours, and sit here devising  vengeance against my neighbours for wrongs they have not done me. I tell thee,  shackles and the prison-house shall punish the next offence of this  kind.&rdquo;          Gurth, knowing his master&rsquo;s irritable temper, attempted no exculpation;  but the Jester, who could presume upon Cedric&rsquo;s tolerance, by virtue of  his privileges as a fool, replied for them both; &ldquo;In troth, uncle Cedric,  you are neither wise nor reasonable to-night.&rdquo;          &ldquo;&lsquo;How, sir?&rdquo; said his master; &ldquo;you shall to the  porter&rsquo;s lodge, and taste of the discipline there, if you give your  foolery such license.&rdquo;          &ldquo;First let your wisdom tell me,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;is it just and  reasonable to punish one person for the fault of another?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Certainly not, fool,&rdquo; answered Cedric.          &ldquo;Then why should you shackle poor Gurth, uncle, for the fault of his dog  Fangs? for I dare be sworn we lost not a minute by the way, when we had got our  herd together, which Fangs did not manage until we heard the  vesper-bell.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Then hang up Fangs,&rdquo; said Cedric, turning hastily towards the  swineherd, &ldquo;if the fault is his, and get thee another dog.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Under favour, uncle,&rdquo; said the Jester, &ldquo;that were still  somewhat on the bow-hand of fair justice; for it was no fault of Fangs that he  was lame and could not gather the herd, but the fault of those that struck off  two of his fore-claws, an operation for which, if the poor fellow had been  consulted, he would scarce have given his voice.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And who dared to lame an animal which belonged to my bondsman?&rdquo;  said the Saxon, kindling in wrath.          &ldquo;Marry, that did old Hubert,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;Sir Philip de  Malvoisin&rsquo;s keeper of the chase. He caught Fangs strolling in the forest,  and said he chased the deer contrary to his master&rsquo;s right, as warden of  the walk.&rdquo;          &ldquo;The foul fiend take Malvoisin,&rdquo; answered the Saxon, &ldquo;and his  keeper both! I will teach them that the wood was disforested in terms of the  great Forest Charter. But enough of this. Go to, knave, go to thy  place&mdash;and thou, Gurth, get thee another dog, and should the keeper dare  to touch it, I will mar his archery; the curse of a coward on my head, if I  strike not off the forefinger of his right hand!&mdash;he shall draw bowstring  no more.&mdash;I crave your pardon, my worthy guests. I am beset here with  neighbours that match your infidels, Sir Knight, in Holy Land. But your homely  fare is before you; feed, and let welcome make amends for hard fare.&rdquo;          The feast, however, which was spread upon the board, needed no apologies from  the lord of the mansion. Swine&rsquo;s flesh, dressed in several modes,  appeared on the lower part of the board, as also that of fowls, deer, goats,  and hares, and various kinds of fish, together with huge loaves and cakes of  bread, and sundry confections made of fruits and honey. The smaller sorts of  wild-fowl, of which there was abundance, were not served up in platters, but  brought in upon small wooden spits or broaches, and offered by the pages and  domestics who bore them, to each guest in succession, who cut from them such a  portion as he pleased. Beside each person of rank was placed a goblet of  silver; the lower board was accommodated with large drinking horns.          When the repast was about to commence, the major-domo, or steward, suddenly  raising his wand, said aloud,&mdash;&ldquo;Forbear!&mdash;Place for the Lady  Rowena.&rdquo;          A side-door at the upper end of the hall now opened behind the banquet table,  and Rowena, followed by four female attendants, entered the apartment. Cedric,  though surprised, and perhaps not altogether agreeably so, at his ward  appearing in public on this occasion, hastened to meet her, and to conduct her,  with respectful ceremony, to the elevated seat at his own right hand,  appropriated to the lady of the mansion. All stood up to receive her; and,  replying to their courtesy by a mute gesture of salutation, she moved  gracefully forward to assume her place at the board. Ere she had time to do so,  the Templar whispered to the Prior, &ldquo;I shall wear no collar of gold of  yours at the tournament. The Chian wine is your own.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Said I not so?&rdquo; answered the Prior; &ldquo;but check your  raptures, the Franklin observes you.&rdquo;          Unheeding this remonstrance, and accustomed only to act upon the immediate  impulse of his own wishes, Brian de Bois-Guilbert kept his eyes riveted on the  Saxon beauty, more striking perhaps to his imagination, because differing  widely from those of the Eastern sultanas.          Formed in the best proportions of her sex, Rowena was tall in stature, yet not  so much so as to attract observation on account of superior height. Her  complexion was exquisitely fair, but the noble cast of her head and features  prevented the insipidity which sometimes attaches to fair beauties. Her clear  blue eye, which sat enshrined beneath a graceful eyebrow of brown sufficiently  marked to give expression to the forehead, seemed capable to kindle as well as  melt, to command as well as to beseech. If mildness were the more natural  expression of such a combination of features, it was plain, that in the present  instance, the exercise of habitual superiority, and the reception of general  homage, had given to the Saxon lady a loftier character, which mingled with and  qualified that bestowed by nature. Her profuse hair, of a colour betwixt brown  and flaxen, was arranged in a fanciful and graceful manner in numerous  ringlets, to form which art had probably aided nature. These locks were braided  with gems, and, being worn at full length, intimated the noble birth and  free-born condition of the maiden. A golden chain, to which was attached a  small reliquary of the same metal, hung round her neck. She wore bracelets on  her arms, which were bare. Her dress was an under-gown and kirtle of pale  sea-green silk, over which hung a long loose robe, which reached to the ground,  having very wide sleeves, which came down, however, very little below the  elbow. This robe was crimson, and manufactured out of the very finest wool. A  veil of silk, interwoven with gold, was attached to the upper part of it, which  could be, at the wearer&rsquo;s pleasure, either drawn over the face and bosom  after the Spanish fashion, or disposed as a sort of drapery round the  shoulders.          When Rowena perceived the Knight Templar&rsquo;s eyes bent on her with an  ardour, that, compared with the dark caverns under which they moved, gave them  the effect of lighted charcoal, she drew with dignity the veil around her face,  as an intimation that the determined freedom of his glance was disagreeable.  Cedric saw the motion and its cause. &ldquo;Sir Templar,&rdquo; said he,  &ldquo;the cheeks of our Saxon maidens have seen too little of the sun to  enable them to bear the fixed glance of a crusader.&rdquo;          &ldquo;If I have offended,&rdquo; replied Sir Brian, &ldquo;I crave your  pardon,&mdash;that is, I crave the Lady Rowena&rsquo;s pardon,&mdash;for my  humility will carry me no lower.&rdquo;          &ldquo;The Lady Rowena,&rdquo; said the Prior, &ldquo;has punished us all, in  chastising the boldness of my friend. Let me hope she will be less cruel to the  splendid train which are to meet at the tournament.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Our going thither,&rdquo; said Cedric, &ldquo;is uncertain. I love not  these vanities, which were unknown to my fathers when England was free.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Let us hope, nevertheless,&rdquo; said the Prior, &ldquo;our company may  determine you to travel thitherward; when the roads are so unsafe, the escort  of Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert is not to be despised.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Sir Prior,&rdquo; answered the Saxon, &ldquo;wheresoever I have  travelled in this land, I have hitherto found myself, with the assistance of my  good sword and faithful followers, in no respect needful of other aid. At  present, if we indeed journey to Ashby-de-la-Zouche, we do so with my noble  neighbour and countryman Athelstane of Coningsburgh, and with such a train as  would set outlaws and feudal enemies at defiance.&mdash;I drink to you, Sir  Prior, in this cup of wine, which I trust your taste will approve, and I thank  you for your courtesy. Should you be so rigid in adhering to monastic  rule,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;as to prefer your acid preparation of milk, I  hope you will not strain courtesy to do me reason.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the Priest, laughing, &ldquo;it is only in our abbey  that we confine ourselves to the &lsquo;lac dulce&rsquo; or the &lsquo;lac  acidum&rsquo; either. Conversing with, the world, we use the world&rsquo;s  fashions, and therefore I answer your pledge in this honest wine, and leave the  weaker liquor to my lay-brother.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said the Templar, filling his goblet, &ldquo;drink wassail  to the fair Rowena; for since her namesake introduced the word into England,  has never been one more worthy of such a tribute. By my faith, I could pardon  the unhappy Vortigern, had he half the cause that we now witness, for making  shipwreck of his honour and his kingdom.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I will spare your courtesy, Sir Knight,&rdquo; said Rowena with dignity,  and without unveiling herself; &ldquo;or rather I will tax it so far as to  require of you the latest news from Palestine, a theme more agreeable to our  English ears than the compliments which your French breeding teaches.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I have little of importance to say, lady,&rdquo; answered Sir Brian de  Bois-Guilbert, &ldquo;excepting the confirmed tidings of a truce with  Saladin.&rdquo;          He was interrupted by Wamba, who had taken his appropriated seat upon a chair,  the back of which was decorated with two ass&rsquo;s ears, and which was placed  about two steps behind that of his master, who, from time to time, supplied him  with victuals from his own trencher; a favour, however, which the Jester shared  with the favourite dogs, of whom, as we have already noticed, there were  several in attendance. Here sat Wamba, with a small table before him, his heels  tucked up against the bar of the chair, his cheeks sucked up so as to make his  jaws resemble a pair of nut-crackers, and his eyes half-shut, yet watching with  alertness every opportunity to exercise his licensed foolery.          &ldquo;These truces with the infidels,&rdquo; he exclaimed, without caring how  suddenly he interrupted the stately Templar, &ldquo;make an old man of  me!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Go to, knave, how so?&rdquo; said Cedric, his features prepared to  receive favourably the expected jest.          &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; answered Wamba, &ldquo;I remember three of them in my  day, each of which was to endure for the course of fifty years; so that, by  computation, I must be at least a hundred and fifty years old.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I will warrant you against dying of old age, however,&rdquo; said the  Templar, who now recognised his friend of the forest; &ldquo;I will assure you  from all deaths but a violent one, if you give such directions to wayfarers, as  you did this night to the Prior and me.&rdquo;          &ldquo;How, sirrah!&rdquo; said Cedric, &ldquo;misdirect travellers? We must  have you whipt; you are at least as much rogue as fool.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I pray thee, uncle,&rdquo; answered the Jester, &ldquo;let my folly, for  once, protect my roguery. I did but make a mistake between my right hand and my  left; and he might have pardoned a greater, who took a fool for his counsellor  and guide.&rdquo;          Conversation was here interrupted by the entrance of the porter&rsquo;s page,  who announced that there was a stranger at the gate, imploring admittance and  hospitality.          &ldquo;Admit him,&rdquo; said Cedric, &ldquo;be he who or what he may;&mdash;a  night like that which roars without, compels even wild animals to herd with  tame, and to seek the protection of man, their mortal foe, rather than perish  by the elements. Let his wants be ministered to with all care&mdash;look to it,  Oswald.&rdquo;          And the steward left the banqueting hall to see the commands of his patron  obeyed.                     CHAPTER V        Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses,  affections, passions? Fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons,  subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by  the same winter and summer, as a Christian is?          M ERCHANT OF  V ENICE           Oswald, returning, whispered into the ear of his master, &ldquo;It is a Jew,  who calls himself Isaac of York; is it fit I should marshall him into the  hall?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Let Gurth do thine office, Oswald,&rdquo; said Wamba with his usual  effrontery; &ldquo;the swineherd will be a fit usher to the Jew.&rdquo;          &ldquo;St Mary,&rdquo; said the Abbot, crossing himself, &ldquo;an unbelieving  Jew, and admitted into this presence!&rdquo;          &ldquo;A dog Jew,&rdquo; echoed the Templar, &ldquo;to approach a defender of  the Holy Sepulchre?&rdquo;          &ldquo;By my faith,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;it would seem the Templars love  the Jews&rsquo; inheritance better than they do their company.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Peace, my worthy guests,&rdquo; said Cedric; &ldquo;my hospitality must  not be bounded by your dislikes. If Heaven bore with the whole nation of  stiff-necked unbelievers for more years than a layman can number, we may endure  the presence of one Jew for a few hours. But I constrain no man to converse or  to feed with him.&mdash;Let him have a board and a morsel  apart,&mdash;unless,&rdquo; he said smiling, &ldquo;these turban&rsquo;d  strangers will admit his society.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Sir Franklin,&rdquo; answered the Templar, &ldquo;my Saracen slaves are  true Moslems, and scorn as much as any Christian to hold intercourse with a  Jew.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Now, in faith,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;I cannot see that the  worshippers of Mahound and Termagaunt have so greatly the advantage over the  people once chosen of Heaven.&rdquo;          &ldquo;He shall sit with thee, Wamba,&rdquo; said Cedric; &ldquo;the fool and  the knave will be well met.&rdquo;          &ldquo;The fool,&rdquo; answered Wamba, raising the relics of a gammon of  bacon, &ldquo;will take care to erect a bulwark against the knave.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; said Cedric, &ldquo;for here he comes.&rdquo;          Introduced with little ceremony, and advancing with fear and hesitation, and  many a bow of deep humility, a tall thin old man, who, however, had lost by the  habit of stooping much of his actual height, approached the lower end of the  board. His features, keen and regular, with an aquiline nose, and piercing  black eyes; his high and wrinkled forehead, and long grey hair and beard, would  have been considered as handsome, had they not been the marks of a physiognomy  peculiar to a race, which, during those dark ages, was alike detested by the  credulous and prejudiced vulgar, and persecuted by the greedy and rapacious  nobility, and who, perhaps, owing to that very hatred and persecution, had  adopted a national character, in which there was much, to say the least, mean  and unamiable.          The Jew&rsquo;s dress, which appeared to have suffered considerably from the  storm, was a plain russet cloak of many folds, covering a dark purple tunic. He  had large boots lined with fur, and a belt around his waist, which sustained a  small knife, together with a case for writing materials, but no weapon. He wore  a high square yellow cap of a peculiar fashion, assigned to his nation to  distinguish them from Christians, and which he doffed with great humility at  the door of the hall.          The reception of this person in the hall of Cedric the Saxon, was such as might  have satisfied the most prejudiced enemy of the tribes of Israel. Cedric  himself coldly nodded in answer to the Jew&rsquo;s repeated salutations, and  signed to him to take place at the lower end of the table, where, however, no  one offered to make room for him. On the contrary, as he passed along the file,  casting a timid supplicating glance, and turning towards each of those who  occupied the lower end of the board, the Saxon domestics squared their  shoulders, and continued to devour their supper with great perseverance, paying  not the least attention to the wants of the new guest. The attendants of the  Abbot crossed themselves, with looks of pious horror, and the very heathen  Saracens, as Isaac drew near them, curled up their whiskers with indignation,  and laid their hands on their poniards, as if ready to rid themselves by the  most desperate means from the apprehended contamination of his nearer approach.          Probably the same motives which induced Cedric to open his hall to this son of  a rejected people, would have made him insist on his attendants receiving Isaac  with more courtesy. But the Abbot had, at this moment, engaged him in a most  interesting discussion on the breed and character of his favourite hounds,  which he would not have interrupted for matters of much greater importance than  that of a Jew going to bed supperless. While Isaac thus stood an outcast in the  present society, like his people among the nations, looking in vain for welcome  or resting place, the pilgrim who sat by the chimney took compassion upon him,  and resigned his seat, saying briefly, &ldquo;Old man, my garments are dried,  my hunger is appeased, thou art both wet and fasting.&rdquo; So saying, he  gathered together, and brought to a flame, the decaying brands which lay  scattered on the ample hearth; took from the larger board a mess of pottage and  seethed kid, placed it upon the small table at which he had himself supped,  and, without waiting the Jew&rsquo;s thanks, went to the other side of the  hall;&mdash;whether from unwillingness to hold more close communication with  the object of his benevolence, or from a wish to draw near to the upper end of  the table, seemed uncertain.          Had there been painters in those days capable to execute such a subject, the  Jew, as he bent his withered form, and expanded his chilled and trembling hands  over the fire, would have formed no bad emblematical personification of the  Winter season. Having dispelled the cold, he turned eagerly to the smoking mess  which was placed before him, and ate with a haste and an apparent relish, that  seemed to betoken long abstinence from food.          Meanwhile the Abbot and Cedric continued their discourse upon hunting; the Lady  Rowena seemed engaged in conversation with one of her attendant females; and  the haughty Templar, whose eye wandered from the Jew to the Saxon beauty,  revolved in his mind thoughts which appeared deeply to interest him.          &ldquo;I marvel, worthy Cedric,&rdquo; said the Abbot, as their discourse  proceeded, &ldquo;that, great as your predilection is for your own manly  language, you do not receive the Norman-French into your favour, so far at  least as the mystery of wood-craft and hunting is concerned. Surely no tongue  is so rich in the various phrases which the field-sports demand, or furnishes  means to the experienced woodman so well to express his jovial art.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Good Father Aymer,&rdquo; said the Saxon, &ldquo;be it known to you, I  care not for those over-sea refinements, without which I can well enough take  my pleasure in the woods. I can wind my horn, though I call not the blast  either a &lsquo;recheate&rsquo; or a &lsquo;morte&rsquo;&mdash;I can cheer my  dogs on the prey, and I can flay and quarter the animal when it is brought  down, without using the newfangled jargon of &lsquo;curee, arbor,  nombles&rsquo;, and all the babble of the fabulous Sir Tristrem.&rdquo;   14            &ldquo;The French,&rdquo; said the Templar, raising his voice with the  presumptuous and authoritative tone which he used upon all occasions, &ldquo;is  not only the natural language of the chase, but that of love and of war, in  which ladies should be won and enemies defied.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Pledge me in a cup of wine, Sir Templar,&rdquo; said Cedric, &ldquo;and  fill another to the Abbot, while I look back some thirty years to tell you  another tale. As Cedric the Saxon then was, his plain English tale needed no  garnish from French troubadours, when it was told in the ear of beauty; and the  field of Northallerton, upon the day of the Holy Standard, could tell whether  the Saxon war-cry was not heard as far within the ranks of the Scottish host as  the &lsquo;cri de guerre&rsquo; of the boldest Norman baron. To the memory of  the brave who fought there!&mdash;Pledge me, my guests.&rdquo; He drank deep,  and went on with increasing warmth. &ldquo;Ay, that was a day of cleaving of  shields, when a hundred banners were bent forwards over the heads of the  valiant, and blood flowed round like water, and death was held better than  flight. A Saxon bard had called it a feast of the swords&mdash;a gathering of  the eagles to the prey&mdash;the clashing of bills upon shield and helmet, the  shouting of battle more joyful than the clamour of a bridal. But our bards are  no more,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;our deeds are lost in those of another  race&mdash;our language&mdash;our very name&mdash;is hastening to decay, and  none mourns for it save one solitary old man&mdash;Cupbearer! knave, fill the  goblets&mdash;To the strong in arms, Sir Templar, be their race or language  what it will, who now bear them best in Palestine among the champions of the  Cross!&rdquo;          &ldquo;It becomes not one wearing this badge to answer,&rdquo; said Sir Brian  de Bois-Guilbert; &ldquo;yet to whom, besides the sworn Champions of the Holy  Sepulchre, can the palm be assigned among the champions of the Cross?&rdquo;          &ldquo;To the Knights Hospitallers,&rdquo; said the Abbot; &ldquo;I have a  brother of their order.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I impeach not their fame,&rdquo; said the Templar;  &ldquo;nevertheless&mdash;-&rdquo;          &ldquo;I think, friend Cedric,&rdquo; said Wamba, interfering, &ldquo;that had  Richard of the Lion&rsquo;s Heart been wise enough to have taken a fool&rsquo;s  advice, he might have staid at home with his merry Englishmen, and left the  recovery of Jerusalem to those same Knights who had most to do with the loss of  it.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Were there, then, none in the English army,&rdquo; said the Lady Rowena,  &ldquo;whose names are worthy to be mentioned with the Knights of the Temple,  and of St John?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Forgive me, lady,&rdquo; replied De Bois-Guilbert; &ldquo;the English  monarch did, indeed, bring to Palestine a host of gallant warriors, second only  to those whose breasts have been the unceasing bulwark of that blessed  land.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Second to NONE,&rdquo; said the Pilgrim, who had stood near enough to  hear, and had listened to this conversation with marked impatience. All turned  toward the spot from whence this unexpected asseveration was heard.                      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; repeated the Pilgrim in a firm and strong voice,  &ldquo;that the English chivalry were second to NONE who ever drew sword in  defence of the Holy Land. I say besides, for I saw it, that King Richard  himself, and five of his knights, held a tournament after the taking of St  John-de-Acre, as challengers against all comers. I say that, on that day, each  knight ran three courses, and cast to the ground three antagonists. I add, that  seven of these assailants were Knights of the Temple&mdash;and Sir Brian de  Bois-Guilbert well knows the truth of what I tell you.&rdquo;          It is impossible for language to describe the bitter scowl of rage which  rendered yet darker the swarthy countenance of the Templar. In the extremity of  his resentment and confusion, his quivering fingers griped towards the handle  of his sword, and perhaps only withdrew, from the consciousness that no act of  violence could be safely executed in that place and presence. Cedric, whose  feelings were all of a right onward and simple kind, and were seldom occupied  by more than one object at once, omitted, in the joyous glee with which he  heard of the glory of his countrymen, to remark the angry confusion of his  guest; &ldquo;I would give thee this golden bracelet, Pilgrim,&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;couldst thou tell me the names of those knights who upheld so gallantly  the renown of merry England.&rdquo;          &ldquo;That will I do blithely,&rdquo; replied the Pilgrim, &ldquo;and without  guerdon; my oath, for a time, prohibits me from touching gold.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I will wear the bracelet for you, if you will, friend Palmer,&rdquo;  said Wamba.          &ldquo;The first in honour as in arms, in renown as in place,&rdquo; said the  Pilgrim, &ldquo;was the brave Richard, King of England.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I forgive him,&rdquo; said Cedric; &ldquo;I forgive him his descent from  the tyrant Duke William.&rdquo;          &ldquo;The Earl of Leicester was the second,&rdquo; continued the Pilgrim;  &ldquo;Sir Thomas Multon of Gilsland was the third.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Of Saxon descent, he at least,&rdquo; said Cedric, with exultation.          &ldquo;Sir Foulk Doilly the fourth,&rdquo; proceeded the Pilgrim.          &ldquo;Saxon also, at least by the mother&rsquo;s side,&rdquo; continued  Cedric, who listened with the utmost eagerness, and forgot, in part at least,  his hatred to the Normans, in the common triumph of the King of England and his  islanders. &ldquo;And who was the fifth?&rdquo; he demanded.          &ldquo;The fifth was Sir Edwin Turneham.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Genuine Saxon, by the soul of Hengist!&rdquo; shouted  Cedric&mdash;&ldquo;And the sixth?&rdquo; he continued with  eagerness&mdash;&ldquo;how name you the sixth?&rdquo;          &ldquo;The sixth,&rdquo; said the Palmer, after a pause, in which he seemed to  recollect himself, &ldquo;was a young knight of lesser renown and lower rank,  assumed into that honourable company, less to aid their enterprise than to make  up their number&mdash;his name dwells not in my memory.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Sir Palmer,&rdquo; said Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert scornfully,  &ldquo;this assumed forgetfulness, after so much has been remembered, comes too  late to serve your purpose. I will myself tell the name of the knight before  whose lance fortune and my horse&rsquo;s fault occasioned my falling&mdash;it  was the Knight of Ivanhoe; nor was there one of the six that, for his years,  had more renown in arms.&mdash;Yet this will I say, and loudly&mdash;that were  he in England, and durst repeat, in this week&rsquo;s tournament, the challenge  of St John-de-Acre, I, mounted and armed as I now am, would give him every  advantage of weapons, and abide the result.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Your challenge would soon be answered,&rdquo; replied the Palmer,  &ldquo;were your antagonist near you. As the matter is, disturb not the  peaceful hall with vaunts of the issue of the conflict, which you well know  cannot take place. If Ivanhoe ever returns from Palestine, I will be his surety  that he meets you.&rdquo;          &ldquo;A goodly security!&rdquo; said the Knight Templar; &ldquo;and what do  you proffer as a pledge?&rdquo;          &ldquo;This reliquary,&rdquo; said the Palmer, taking a small ivory box from  his bosom, and crossing himself, &ldquo;containing a portion of the true cross,  brought from the Monastery of Mount Carmel.&rdquo;          The Prior of Jorvaulx crossed himself and repeated a pater noster, in which all  devoutly joined, excepting the Jew, the Mahomedans, and the Templar; the latter  of whom, without vailing his bonnet, or testifying any reverence for the  alleged sanctity of the relic, took from his neck a gold chain, which he flung  on the board, saying&mdash;&ldquo;Let Prior Aymer hold my pledge and that of  this nameless vagrant, in token that when the Knight of Ivanhoe comes within  the four seas of Britain, he underlies the challenge of Brian de Bois-Guilbert,  which, if he answer not, I will proclaim him as a coward on the walls of every  Temple Court in Europe.&rdquo;          &ldquo;It will not need,&rdquo; said the Lady Rowena, breaking silence;  &ldquo;My voice shall be heard, if no other in this hall is raised in behalf of  the absent Ivanhoe. I affirm he will meet fairly every honourable challenge.  Could my weak warrant add security to the inestimable pledge of this holy  pilgrim, I would pledge name and fame that Ivanhoe gives this proud knight the  meeting he desires.&rdquo;          A crowd of conflicting emotions seemed to have occupied Cedric, and kept him  silent during this discussion. Gratified pride, resentment, embarrassment,  chased each other over his broad and open brow, like the shadow of clouds  drifting over a harvest-field; while his attendants, on whom the name of the  sixth knight seemed to produce an effect almost electrical, hung in suspense  upon their master&rsquo;s looks. But when Rowena spoke, the sound of her voice  seemed to startle him from his silence.          &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said Cedric, &ldquo;this beseems not; were further pledge  necessary, I myself, offended, and justly offended, as I am, would yet gage my  honour for the honour of Ivanhoe. But the wager of battle is complete, even  according to the fantastic fashions of Norman chivalry&mdash;Is it not, Father  Aymer?&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; replied the Prior; &ldquo;and the blessed relic and rich  chain will I bestow safely in the treasury of our convent, until the decision  of this warlike challenge.&rdquo;          Having thus spoken, he crossed himself again and again, and after many  genuflections and muttered prayers, he delivered the reliquary to Brother  Ambrose, his attendant monk, while he himself swept up with less ceremony, but  perhaps with no less internal satisfaction, the golden chain, and bestowed it  in a pouch lined with perfumed leather, which opened under his arm. &ldquo;And  now, Sir Cedric,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my ears are chiming vespers with the  strength of your good wine&mdash;permit us another pledge to the welfare of the  Lady Rowena, and indulge us with liberty to pass to our repose.&rdquo;          &ldquo;By the rood of Bromholme,&rdquo; said the Saxon, &ldquo;you do but small  credit to your fame, Sir Prior! Report speaks you a bonny monk, that would hear  the matin chime ere he quitted his bowl; and, old as I am, I feared to have  shame in encountering you. But, by my faith, a Saxon boy of twelve, in my time,  would not so soon have relinquished his goblet.&rdquo;          The Prior had his own reasons, however, for persevering in the course of  temperance which he had adopted. He was not only a professional peacemaker, but  from practice a hater of all feuds and brawls. It was not altogether from a  love to his neighbour, or to himself, or from a mixture of both. On the present  occasion, he had an instinctive apprehension of the fiery temper of the Saxon,  and saw the danger that the reckless and presumptuous spirit, of which his  companion had already given so many proofs, might at length produce some  disagreeable explosion. He therefore gently insinuated the incapacity of the  native of any other country to engage in the genial conflict of the bowl with  the hardy and strong-headed Saxons; something he mentioned, but slightly, about  his own holy character, and ended by pressing his proposal to depart to repose.          The grace-cup was accordingly served round, and the guests, after making deep  obeisance to their landlord and to the Lady Rowena, arose and mingled in the  hall, while the heads of the family, by separate doors, retired with their  attendants.          &ldquo;Unbelieving dog,&rdquo; said the Templar to Isaac the Jew, as he passed  him in the throng, &ldquo;dost thou bend thy course to the tournament?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I do so propose,&rdquo; replied Isaac, bowing in all humility, &ldquo;if  it please your reverend valour.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said the Knight, &ldquo;to gnaw the bowels of our nobles with  usury, and to gull women and boys with gauds and toys&mdash;I warrant thee  store of shekels in thy Jewish scrip.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Not a shekel, not a silver penny, not a halfling&mdash;so help me the  God of Abraham!&rdquo; said the Jew, clasping his hands; &ldquo;I go but to  seek the assistance of some brethren of my tribe to aid me to pay the fine  which the Exchequer of the Jews have imposed upon me&mdash;Father Jacob be my  speed! I am an impoverished wretch&mdash;the very gaberdine I wear is borrowed  from Reuben of Tadcaster.&rdquo;   15            The Templar smiled sourly as he replied, &ldquo;Beshrew thee for a  false-hearted liar!&rdquo; and passing onward, as if disdaining farther  conference, he communed with his Moslem slaves in a language unknown to the  bystanders. The poor Israelite seemed so staggered by the address of the  military monk, that the Templar had passed on to the extremity of the hall ere  he raised his head from the humble posture which he had assumed, so far as to  be sensible of his departure. And when he did look around, it was with the  astonished air of one at whose feet a thunderbolt has just burst, and who hears  still the astounding report ringing in his ears.          The Templar and Prior were shortly after marshalled to their sleeping  apartments by the steward and the cupbearer, each attended by two torchbearers  and two servants carrying refreshments, while servants of inferior condition  indicated to their retinue and to the other guests their respective places of  repose.                     CHAPTER VI        To buy his favour I extend this friendship:   If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;   And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.          M ERCHANT OF  V ENICE           As the Palmer, lighted by a domestic with a torch, passed through the intricate  combination of apartments of this large and irregular mansion, the cupbearer  coming behind him whispered in his ear, that if he had no objection to a cup of  good mead in his apartment, there were many domestics in that family who would  gladly hear the news he had brought from the Holy Land, and particularly that  which concerned the Knight of Ivanhoe. Wamba presently appeared to urge the  same request, observing that a cup after midnight was worth three after curfew.  Without disputing a maxim urged by such grave authority, the Palmer thanked  them for their courtesy, but observed that he had included in his religious  vow, an obligation never to speak in the kitchen on matters which were  prohibited in the hall. &ldquo;That vow,&rdquo; said Wamba to the cupbearer,  &ldquo;would scarce suit a serving-man.&rdquo;          The cupbearer shrugged up his shoulders in displeasure. &ldquo;I thought to  have lodged him in the solere chamber,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but since he is  so unsocial to Christians, e&rsquo;en let him take the next stall to Isaac the  Jew&rsquo;s.&mdash;Anwold,&rdquo; said he to the torchbearer, &ldquo;carry the  Pilgrim to the southern cell.&mdash;I give you good-night,&rdquo; he added,  &ldquo;Sir Palmer, with small thanks for short courtesy.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Good-night, and Our Lady&rsquo;s benison,&rdquo; said the Palmer, with  composure; and his guide moved forward.          In a small antechamber, into which several doors opened, and which was lighted  by a small iron lamp, they met a second interruption from the waiting-maid of  Rowena, who, saying in a tone of authority, that her mistress desired to speak  with the Palmer, took the torch from the hand of Anwold, and, bidding him await  her return, made a sign to the Palmer to follow. Apparently he did not think it  proper to decline this invitation as he had done the former; for, though his  gesture indicated some surprise at the summons, he obeyed it without answer or  remonstrance.          A short passage, and an ascent of seven steps, each of which was composed of a  solid beam of oak, led him to the apartment of the Lady Rowena, the rude  magnificence of which corresponded to the respect which was paid to her by the  lord of the mansion. The walls were covered with embroidered hangings, on which  different-coloured silks, interwoven with gold and silver threads, had been  employed with all the art of which the age was capable, to represent the sports  of hunting and hawking. The bed was adorned with the same rich tapestry, and  surrounded with curtains dyed with purple. The seats had also their stained  coverings, and one, which was higher than the rest, was accommodated with a  footstool of ivory, curiously carved.          No fewer than four silver candelabras, holding great waxen torches, served to  illuminate this apartment. Yet let not modern beauty envy the magnificence of a  Saxon princess. The walls of the apartment were so ill finished and so full of  crevices, that the rich hangings shook in the night blast, and, in despite of a  sort of screen intended to protect them from the wind, the flame of the torches  streamed sideways into the air, like the unfurled pennon of a chieftain.  Magnificence there was, with some rude attempt at taste; but of comfort there  was little, and, being unknown, it was unmissed.          The Lady Rowena, with three of her attendants standing at her back, and  arranging her hair ere she lay down to rest, was seated in the sort of throne  already mentioned, and looked as if born to exact general homage. The Pilgrim  acknowledged her claim to it by a low genuflection.          &ldquo;Rise, Palmer,&rdquo; said she graciously. &ldquo;The defender of the  absent has a right to favourable reception from all who value truth, and honour  manhood.&rdquo; She then said to her train, &ldquo;Retire, excepting only  Elgitha; I would speak with this holy Pilgrim.&rdquo;          The maidens, without leaving the apartment, retired to its further extremity,  and sat down on a small bench against the wall, where they remained mute as  statues, though at such a distance that their whispers could not have  interrupted the conversation of their mistress.          &ldquo;Pilgrim,&rdquo; said the lady, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, during  which she seemed uncertain how to address him, &ldquo;you this night mentioned  a name&mdash;I mean,&rdquo; she said, with a degree of effort, &ldquo;the name  of Ivanhoe, in the halls where by nature and kindred it should have sounded  most acceptably; and yet, such is the perverse course of fate, that of many  whose hearts must have throbbed at the sound, I, only, dare ask you where, and  in what condition, you left him of whom you spoke?&mdash;We heard, that, having  remained in Palestine, on account of his impaired health, after the departure  of the English army, he had experienced the persecution of the French faction,  to whom the Templars are known to be attached.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I know little of the Knight of Ivanhoe,&rdquo; answered the Palmer, with  a troubled voice. &ldquo;I would I knew him better, since you, lady, are  interested in his fate. He hath, I believe, surmounted the persecution of his  enemies in Palestine, and is on the eve of returning to England, where you,  lady, must know better than I, what is his chance of happiness.&rdquo;          The Lady Rowena sighed deeply, and asked more particularly when the Knight of  Ivanhoe might be expected in his native country, and whether he would not be  exposed to great dangers by the road. On the first point, the Palmer professed  ignorance; on the second, he said that the voyage might be safely made by the  way of Venice and Genoa, and from thence through France to England.  &ldquo;Ivanhoe,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was so well acquainted with the language  and manners of the French, that there was no fear of his incurring any hazard  during that part of his travels.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Would to God,&rdquo; said the Lady Rowena, &ldquo;he were here safely  arrived, and able to bear arms in the approaching tourney, in which the  chivalry of this land are expected to display their address and valour. Should  Athelstane of Coningsburgh obtain the prize, Ivanhoe is like to hear evil  tidings when he reaches England.&mdash;How looked he, stranger, when you last  saw him? Had disease laid her hand heavy upon his strength and  comeliness?&rdquo;          &ldquo;He was darker,&rdquo; said the Palmer, &ldquo;and thinner, than when he  came from Cyprus in the train of Cœur-de-Lion, and care seemed to sit heavy on  his brow; but I approached not his presence, because he is unknown to  me.&rdquo;          &ldquo;He will,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;I fear, find little in his native  land to clear those clouds from his countenance. Thanks, good Pilgrim, for your  information concerning the companion of my childhood.&mdash;Maidens,&rdquo; she  said, &ldquo;draw near&mdash;offer the sleeping cup to this holy man, whom I  will no longer detain from repose.&rdquo;          One of the maidens presented a silver cup, containing a rich mixture of wine  and spice, which Rowena barely put to her lips. It was then offered to the  Palmer, who, after a low obeisance, tasted a few drops.          &ldquo;Accept this alms, friend,&rdquo; continued the lady, offering a piece of  gold, &ldquo;in acknowledgment of thy painful travail, and of the shrines thou  hast visited.&rdquo;          The Palmer received the boon with another low reverence, and followed Edwina  out of the apartment.          In the anteroom he found his attendant Anwold, who, taking the torch from the  hand of the waiting-maid, conducted him with more haste than ceremony to an  exterior and ignoble part of the building, where a number of small apartments,  or rather cells, served for sleeping places to the lower order of domestics,  and to strangers of mean degree.          &ldquo;In which of these sleeps the Jew?&rdquo; said the Pilgrim.          &ldquo;The unbelieving dog,&rdquo; answered Anwold, &ldquo;kennels in the cell  next your holiness.&mdash;St Dunstan, how it must be scraped and cleansed ere  it be again fit for a Christian!&rdquo;          &ldquo;And where sleeps Gurth the swineherd?&rdquo; said the stranger.          &ldquo;Gurth,&rdquo; replied the bondsman, &ldquo;sleeps in the cell on your  right, as the Jew on that to your left; you serve to keep the child of  circumcision separate from the abomination of his tribe. You might have  occupied a more honourable place had you accepted of Oswald&rsquo;s  invitation.&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is as well as it is,&rdquo; said the Palmer; &ldquo;the company, even  of a Jew, can hardly spread contamination through an oaken partition.&rdquo;          So saying, he entered the cabin allotted to him, and taking the torch from the  domestic&rsquo;s hand, thanked him, and wished him good-night. Having shut the  door of his cell, he placed the torch in a candlestick made of wood, and looked  around his sleeping apartment, the furniture of which was of the most simple  kind. It consisted of a rude wooden stool, and still ruder hutch or bed-frame,  stuffed with clean straw, and accommodated with two or three sheepskins by way  of bed-clothes.          The Palmer, having extinguished his torch, threw himself, without taking off  any part of his clothes, on this rude couch, and slept, or at least retained  his recumbent posture, till the earliest sunbeams found their way through the  little grated window, which served at once to admit both air and light to his  uncomfortable cell. He then started up, and after repeating his matins, and  adjusting his dress, he left it, and entered that of Isaac the Jew, lifting the  latch as gently as he could.          The inmate was lying in troubled slumber upon a couch similar to that on which  the Palmer himself had passed the night. Such parts of his dress as the Jew had  laid aside on the preceding evening, were disposed carefully around his person,  as if to prevent the hazard of their being carried off during his slumbers.  There was a trouble on his brow amounting almost to agony. His hands and arms  moved convulsively, as if struggling with the nightmare; and besides several  ejaculations in Hebrew, the following were distinctly heard in the  Norman-English, or mixed language of the country: &ldquo;For the sake of the  God of Abraham, spare an unhappy old man! I am poor, I am  penniless&mdash;should your irons wrench my limbs asunder, I could not gratify  you!&rdquo;          The Palmer awaited not the end of the Jew&rsquo;s vision, but stirred him with  his pilgrim&rsquo;s staff. The touch probably associated, as is usual, with  some of the apprehensions excited by his dream; for the old man started up, his  grey hair standing almost erect upon his head, and huddling some part of his  garments about him, while he held the detached pieces with the tenacious grasp  of a falcon, he fixed upon the Palmer his keen black eyes, expressive of wild  surprise and of bodily apprehension.          &ldquo;Fear nothing from me, Isaac,&rdquo; said the Palmer, &ldquo;I come as  your friend.&rdquo;          &ldquo;The God of Israel requite you,&rdquo; said the Jew, greatly relieved;  &ldquo;I dreamed&mdash;But Father Abraham be praised, it was but a  dream.&rdquo; Then, collecting himself, he added in his usual tone, &ldquo;And  what may it be your pleasure to want at so early an hour with the poor  Jew?&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is to tell you,&rdquo; said the Palmer, &ldquo;that if you leave not  this mansion instantly, and travel not with some haste, your journey may prove  a dangerous one.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Holy father!&rdquo; said the Jew, &ldquo;whom could it interest to  endanger so poor a wretch as I am?&rdquo;          &ldquo;The purpose you can best guess,&rdquo; said the Pilgrim; &ldquo;but rely  on this, that when the Templar crossed the hall yesternight, he spoke to his  Mussulman slaves in the Saracen language, which I well understand, and charged  them this morning to watch the journey of the Jew, to seize upon him when at a  convenient distance from the mansion, and to conduct him to the castle of  Philip de Malvoisin, or to that of Reginald Front-de-Bœuf.&rdquo;          It is impossible to describe the extremity of terror which seized upon the Jew  at this information, and seemed at once to overpower his whole faculties. His  arms fell down to his sides, and his head drooped on his breast, his knees bent  under his weight, every nerve and muscle of his frame seemed to collapse and  lose its energy, and he sunk at the foot of the Palmer, not in the fashion of  one who intentionally stoops, kneels, or prostrates himself to excite  compassion, but like a man borne down on all sides by the pressure of some  invisible force, which crushes him to the earth without the power of  resistance.          &ldquo;Holy God of Abraham!&rdquo; was his first exclamation, folding and  elevating his wrinkled hands, but without raising his grey head from the  pavement; &ldquo;Oh, holy Moses! O, blessed Aaron! the dream is not dreamed for  nought, and the vision cometh not in vain! I feel their irons already tear my  sinews! I feel the rack pass over my body like the saws, and harrows, and axes  of iron over the men of Rabbah, and of the cities of the children of  Ammon!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Stand up, Isaac, and hearken to me,&rdquo; said the Palmer, who viewed  the extremity of his distress with a compassion in which contempt was largely  mingled; &ldquo;you have cause for your terror, considering how your brethren  have been used, in order to extort from them their hoards, both by princes and  nobles; but stand up, I say, and I will point out to you the means of escape.  Leave this mansion instantly, while its inmates sleep sound after the last  night&rsquo;s revel. I will guide you by the secret paths of the forest, known  as well to me as to any forester that ranges it, and I will not leave you till  you are under safe conduct of some chief or baron going to the tournament,  whose good-will you have probably the means of securing.&rdquo;          As the ears of Isaac received the hopes of escape which this speech intimated,  he began gradually, and inch by inch, as it were, to raise himself up from the  ground, until he fairly rested upon his knees, throwing back his long grey hair  and beard, and fixing his keen black eyes upon the Palmer&rsquo;s face, with a  look expressive at once of hope and fear, not unmingled with suspicion. But  when he heard the concluding part of the sentence, his original terror appeared  to revive in full force, and he dropt once more on his face, exclaiming,  &ldquo; I  possess the means of securing good-will! alas! there is but one  road to the favour of a Christian, and how can the poor Jew find it, whom  extortions have already reduced to the misery of Lazarus?&rdquo; Then, as if  suspicion had overpowered his other feelings, he suddenly exclaimed, &ldquo;For  the love of God, young man, betray me not&mdash;for the sake of the Great  Father who made us all, Jew as well as Gentile, Israelite and  Ishmaelite&mdash;do me no treason! I have not means to secure the good-will of  a Christian beggar, were he rating it at a single penny.&rdquo; As he spoke  these last words, he raised himself, and grasped the Palmer&rsquo;s mantle with  a look of the most earnest entreaty. The pilgrim extricated himself, as if  there were contamination in the touch.          &ldquo;Wert thou loaded with all the wealth of thy tribe,&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;what interest have I to injure thee?&mdash;In this dress I am vowed to  poverty, nor do I change it for aught save a horse and a coat of mail. Yet  think not that I care for thy company, or propose myself advantage by it;  remain here if thou wilt&mdash;Cedric the Saxon may protect thee.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the Jew, &ldquo;he will not let me travel in his  train&mdash;Saxon or Norman will be equally ashamed of the poor Israelite; and  to travel by myself through the domains of Philip de Malvoisin and Reginald  Front-de-Bœuf&mdash;Good youth, I will go with you!&mdash;Let us  haste&mdash;let us gird up our loins&mdash;let us flee!&mdash;Here is thy  staff, why wilt thou tarry?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I tarry not,&rdquo; said the Pilgrim, giving way to the urgency of his  companion; &ldquo;but I must secure the means of leaving this  place&mdash;follow me.&rdquo;          He led the way to the adjoining cell, which, as the reader is apprised, was  occupied by Gurth the swineherd.&mdash;&ldquo;Arise, Gurth,&rdquo; said the  Pilgrim, &ldquo;arise quickly. Undo the postern gate, and let out the Jew and  me.&rdquo;          Gurth, whose occupation, though now held so mean, gave him as much consequence  in Saxon England as that of Eumaeus in Ithaca, was offended at the familiar and  commanding tone assumed by the Palmer. &ldquo;The Jew leaving  Rotherwood,&rdquo; said he, raising himself on his elbow, and looking  superciliously at him without quitting his pallet, &ldquo;and travelling in  company with the Palmer to boot&mdash;&rdquo;          &ldquo;I should as soon have dreamt,&rdquo; said Wamba, who entered the  apartment at the instant, &ldquo;of his stealing away with a gammon of  bacon.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said Gurth, again laying down his head on the  wooden log which served him for a pillow, &ldquo;both Jew and Gentile must be  content to abide the opening of the great gate&mdash;we suffer no visitors to  depart by stealth at these unseasonable hours.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said the Pilgrim, in a commanding tone, &ldquo;you  will not, I think, refuse me that favour.&rdquo;          So saying, he stooped over the bed of the recumbent swineherd, and whispered  something in his ear in Saxon. Gurth started up as if electrified. The Pilgrim,  raising his finger in an attitude as if to express caution, added,  &ldquo;Gurth, beware&mdash;thou are wont to be prudent. I say, undo the  postern&mdash;thou shalt know more anon.&rdquo;          With hasty alacrity Gurth obeyed him, while Wamba and the Jew followed, both  wondering at the sudden change in the swineherd&rsquo;s demeanour. &ldquo;My  mule, my mule!&rdquo; said the Jew, as soon as they stood without the postern.          &ldquo;Fetch him his mule,&rdquo; said the Pilgrim; &ldquo;and, hearest  thou,&mdash;let me have another, that I may bear him company till he is beyond  these parts&mdash;I will return it safely to some of Cedric&rsquo;s train at  Ashby. And do thou&rdquo;&mdash;he whispered the rest in Gurth&rsquo;s ear.          &ldquo;Willingly, most willingly shall it be done,&rdquo; said Gurth, and  instantly departed to execute the commission.          &ldquo;I wish I knew,&rdquo; said Wamba, when his comrade&rsquo;s back was  turned, &ldquo;what you Palmers learn in the Holy Land.&rdquo;          &ldquo;To say our orisons, fool,&rdquo; answered the Pilgrim, &ldquo;to repent  our sins, and to mortify ourselves with fastings, vigils, and long  prayers.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Something more potent than that,&rdquo; answered the Jester; &ldquo;for  when would repentance or prayer make Gurth do a courtesy, or fasting or vigil  persuade him to lend you a mule?&mdash;I trow you might as well have told his  favourite black boar of thy vigils and penance, and wouldst have gotten as  civil an answer.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Go to,&rdquo; said the Pilgrim, &ldquo;thou art but a Saxon fool.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou sayst well,&rdquo; said the Jester; &ldquo;had I been born a  Norman, as I think thou art, I would have had luck on my side, and been next  door to a wise man.&rdquo;          At this moment Gurth appeared on the opposite side of the moat with the mules.  The travellers crossed the ditch upon a drawbridge of only two planks breadth,  the narrowness of which was matched with the straitness of the postern, and  with a little wicket in the exterior palisade, which gave access to the forest.  No sooner had they reached the mules, than the Jew, with hasty and trembling  hands, secured behind the saddle a small bag of blue buckram, which he took  from under his cloak, containing, as he muttered, &ldquo;a change of  raiment&mdash;only a change of raiment.&rdquo; Then getting upon the animal  with more alacrity and haste than could have been anticipated from his years,  he lost no time in so disposing of the skirts of his gabardine as to conceal  completely from observation the burden which he had thus deposited &ldquo;en  croupe&rdquo;.          The Pilgrim mounted with more deliberation, reaching, as he departed, his hand  to Gurth, who kissed it with the utmost possible veneration. The swineherd  stood gazing after the travellers until they were lost under the boughs of the  forest path, when he was disturbed from his reverie by the voice of Wamba.          &ldquo;Knowest thou,&rdquo; said the Jester, &ldquo;my good friend Gurth, that  thou art strangely courteous and most unwontedly pious on this summer morning?  I would I were a black Prior or a barefoot Palmer, to avail myself of thy  unwonted zeal and courtesy&mdash;certes, I would make more out of it than a  kiss of the hand.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou art no fool thus far, Wamba,&rdquo; answered Gurth, &ldquo;though  thou arguest from appearances, and the wisest of us can do no more&mdash;But it  is time to look after my charge.&rdquo;          So saying, he turned back to the mansion, attended by the Jester.          Meanwhile the travellers continued to press on their journey with a dispatch  which argued the extremity of the Jew&rsquo;s fears, since persons at his age  are seldom fond of rapid motion. The Palmer, to whom every path and outlet in  the wood appeared to be familiar, led the way through the most devious paths,  and more than once excited anew the suspicion of the Israelite, that he  intended to betray him into some ambuscade of his enemies.          His doubts might have been indeed pardoned; for, except perhaps the flying  fish, there was no race existing on the earth, in the air, or the waters, who  were the object of such an unintermitting, general, and relentless persecution  as the Jews of this period. Upon the slightest and most unreasonable pretences,  as well as upon accusations the most absurd and groundless, their persons and  property were exposed to every turn of popular fury; for Norman, Saxon, Dane,  and Briton, however adverse these races were to each other, contended which  should look with greatest detestation upon a people, whom it was accounted a  point of religion to hate, to revile, to despise, to plunder, and to persecute.  The kings of the Norman race, and the independent nobles, who followed their  example in all acts of tyranny, maintained against this devoted people a  persecution of a more regular, calculated, and self-interested kind. It is a  well-known story of King John, that he confined a wealthy Jew in one of the  royal castles, and daily caused one of his teeth to be torn out, until, when  the jaw of the unhappy Israelite was half disfurnished, he consented to pay a  large sum, which it was the tyrant&rsquo;s object to extort from him. The  little ready money which was in the country was chiefly in possession of this  persecuted people, and the nobility hesitated not to follow the example of  their sovereign, in wringing it from them by every species of oppression, and  even personal torture. Yet the passive courage inspired by the love of gain,  induced the Jews to dare the various evils to which they were subjected, in  consideration of the immense profits which they were enabled to realize in a  country naturally so wealthy as England. In spite of every kind of  discouragement, and even of the special court of taxations already mentioned,  called the Jews&rsquo; Exchequer, erected for the very purpose of despoiling  and distressing them, the Jews increased, multiplied, and accumulated huge  sums, which they transferred from one hand to another by means of bills of  exchange&mdash;an invention for which commerce is said to be indebted to them,  and which enabled them to transfer their wealth from land to land, that when  threatened with oppression in one country, their treasure might be secured in  another.          The obstinacy and avarice of the Jews being thus in a measure placed in  opposition to the fanaticism that tyranny of those under whom they lived,  seemed to increase in proportion to the persecution with which they were  visited; and the immense wealth they usually acquired in commerce, while it  frequently placed them in danger, was at other times used to extend their  influence, and to secure to them a certain degree of protection. On these terms  they lived; and their character, influenced accordingly, was watchful,  suspicious, and timid&mdash;yet obstinate, uncomplying, and skilful in evading  the dangers to which they were exposed.          When the travellers had pushed on at a rapid rate through many devious paths,  the Palmer at length broke silence.          &ldquo;That large decayed oak,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;marks the boundaries over  which Front-de-Bœuf claims authority&mdash;we are long since far from those of  Malvoisin. There is now no fear of pursuit.&rdquo;          &ldquo;May the wheels of their chariots be taken off,&rdquo; said the Jew,  &ldquo;like those of the host of Pharaoh, that they may drive  heavily!&mdash;But leave me not, good Pilgrim&mdash;Think but of that fierce  and savage Templar, with his Saracen slaves&mdash;they will regard neither  territory, nor manor, nor lordship.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Our road,&rdquo; said the Palmer, &ldquo;should here separate; for it  beseems not men of my character and thine to travel together longer than needs  must be. Besides, what succour couldst thou have from me, a peaceful Pilgrim,  against two armed heathens?&rdquo;          &ldquo;O good youth,&rdquo; answered the Jew, &ldquo;thou canst defend me, and  I know thou wouldst. Poor as I am, I will requite it&mdash;not with money, for  money, so help me my Father Abraham, I have none&mdash;but&mdash;-&rdquo;          &ldquo;Money and recompense,&rdquo; said the Palmer, interrupting him, &ldquo;I  have already said I require not of thee. Guide thee I can; and, it may be, even  in some sort defend thee; since to protect a Jew against a Saracen, can scarce  be accounted unworthy of a Christian. Therefore, Jew, I will see thee safe  under some fitting escort. We are now not far from the town of Sheffield, where  thou mayest easily find many of thy tribe with whom to take refuge.&rdquo;          &ldquo;The blessing of Jacob be upon thee, good youth!&rdquo; said the Jew;  &ldquo;in Sheffield I can harbour with my kinsman Zareth, and find some means  of travelling forth with safety.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; said the Palmer; &ldquo;at Sheffield then we part, and  half-an-hour&rsquo;s riding will bring us in sight of that town.&rdquo;          The half hour was spent in perfect silence on both parts; the Pilgrim perhaps  disdaining to address the Jew, except in case of absolute necessity, and the  Jew not presuming to force a conversation with a person whose journey to the  Holy Sepulchre gave a sort of sanctity to his character. They paused on the top  of a gently rising bank, and the Pilgrim, pointing to the town of Sheffield,  which lay beneath them, repeated the words, &ldquo;Here, then, we part.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Not till you have had the poor Jew&rsquo;s thanks,&rdquo; said Isaac;  &ldquo;for I presume not to ask you to go with me to my kinsman Zareth&rsquo;s,  who might aid me with some means of repaying your good offices.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I have already said,&rdquo; answered the Pilgrim, &ldquo;that I desire  no recompense. If among the huge list of thy debtors, thou wilt, for my sake,  spare the gyves and the dungeon to some unhappy Christian who stands in thy  danger, I shall hold this morning&rsquo;s service to thee well bestowed.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Stay, stay,&rdquo; said the Jew, laying hold of his garment;  &ldquo;something would I do more than this, something for thyself.&mdash;God  knows the Jew is poor&mdash;yes, Isaac is the beggar of his tribe&mdash;but  forgive me should I guess what thou most lackest at this moment.&rdquo;          &ldquo;If thou wert to guess truly,&rdquo; said the Palmer, &ldquo;it is what  thou canst not supply, wert thou as wealthy as thou sayst thou art poor.&rdquo;          &ldquo;As I say?&rdquo; echoed the Jew; &ldquo;O! believe it, I say but the  truth; I am a plundered, indebted, distressed man. Hard hands have wrung from  me my goods, my money, my ships, and all that I possessed&mdash;Yet I can tell  thee what thou lackest, and, it may be, supply it too. Thy wish even now is for  a horse and armour.&rdquo;          The Palmer started, and turned suddenly towards the Jew:&mdash;&ldquo;What  fiend prompted that guess?&rdquo; said he, hastily.          &ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; said the Jew, smiling, &ldquo;so that it be a true  one&mdash;and, as I can guess thy want, so I can supply it.&rdquo;          &ldquo;But consider,&rdquo; said the Palmer, &ldquo;my character, my dress, my  vow.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I know you Christians,&rdquo; replied the Jew, &ldquo;and that the  noblest of you will take the staff and sandal in superstitious penance, and  walk afoot to visit the graves of dead men.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Blaspheme not, Jew,&rdquo; said the Pilgrim, sternly.          &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; said the Jew; &ldquo;I spoke rashly. But there dropt  words from you last night and this morning, that, like sparks from flint,  showed the metal within; and in the bosom of that Palmer&rsquo;s gown, is  hidden a knight&rsquo;s chain and spurs of gold. They glanced as you stooped  over my bed in the morning.&rdquo;          The Pilgrim could not forbear smiling. &ldquo;Were thy garments searched by as  curious an eye, Isaac,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what discoveries might not be  made?&rdquo;          &ldquo;No more of that,&rdquo; said the Jew, changing colour; and drawing forth  his writing materials in haste, as if to stop the conversation, he began to  write upon a piece of paper which he supported on the top of his yellow cap,  without dismounting from his mule. When he had finished, he delivered the  scroll, which was in the Hebrew character, to the Pilgrim, saying, &ldquo;In  the town of Leicester all men know the rich Jew, Kirjath Jairam of Lombardy;  give him this scroll&mdash;he hath on sale six Milan harnesses, the worst would  suit a crowned head&mdash;ten goodly steeds, the worst might mount a king, were  he to do battle for his throne. Of these he will give thee thy choice, with  every thing else that can furnish thee forth for the tournament: when it is  over, thou wilt return them safely&mdash;unless thou shouldst have wherewith to  pay their value to the owner.&rdquo;          &ldquo;But, Isaac,&rdquo; said the Pilgrim, smiling, &ldquo;dost thou know that  in these sports, the arms and steed of the knight who is unhorsed are forfeit  to his victor? Now I may be unfortunate, and so lose what I cannot replace or  repay.&rdquo;          The Jew looked somewhat astounded at this possibility; but collecting his  courage, he replied hastily. &ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;It is  impossible&mdash;I will not think so. The blessing of Our Father will be upon  thee. Thy lance will be powerful as the rod of Moses.&rdquo;          So saying, he was turning his mule&rsquo;s head away, when the Palmer, in his  turn, took hold of his gaberdine. &ldquo;Nay, but Isaac, thou knowest not all  the risk. The steed may be slain, the armour injured&mdash;for I will spare  neither horse nor man. Besides, those of thy tribe give nothing for nothing;  something there must be paid for their use.&rdquo;          The Jew twisted himself in the saddle, like a man in a fit of the colic; but  his better feelings predominated over those which were most familiar to him.  &ldquo;I care not,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I care not&mdash;let me go. If there  is damage, it will cost you nothing&mdash;if there is usage money, Kirjath  Jairam will forgive it for the sake of his kinsman Isaac. Fare thee  well!&mdash;Yet hark thee, good youth,&rdquo; said he, turning about,  &ldquo;thrust thyself not too forward into this vain hurly-burly&mdash;I speak  not for endangering the steed, and coat of armour, but for the sake of thine  own life and limbs.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Gramercy for thy caution,&rdquo; said the Palmer, again smiling;  &ldquo;I will use thy courtesy frankly, and it will go hard with me but I will  requite it.&rdquo;          They parted, and took different roads for the town of Sheffield.                     CHAPTER VII        Knights, with a long retinue of their squires,   In gaudy liveries march and quaint attires;   One laced the helm, another held the lance,   A third the shining buckler did advance.   The courser paw&rsquo;d the ground with restless feet,   And snorting foam&rsquo;d and champ&rsquo;d the golden bit.   The smiths and armourers on palfreys ride,   Files in their hands, and hammers at their side;   And nails for loosen&rsquo;d spears, and thongs for shields provide.   The yeomen guard the streets in seemly bands;   And clowns come crowding on, with cudgels in their hands.          P ALAMON AND  A RCITE           The condition of the English nation was at this time sufficiently miserable.  King Richard was absent a prisoner, and in the power of the perfidious and  cruel Duke of Austria. Even the very place of his captivity was uncertain, and  his fate but very imperfectly known to the generality of his subjects, who  were, in the meantime, a prey to every species of subaltern oppression.          Prince John, in league with Philip of France, Cœur-de-Lion&rsquo;s mortal  enemy, was using every species of influence with the Duke of Austria, to  prolong the captivity of his brother Richard, to whom he stood indebted for so  many favours. In the meantime, he was strengthening his own faction in the  kingdom, of which he proposed to dispute the succession, in case of the  King&rsquo;s death, with the legitimate heir, Arthur Duke of Brittany, son of  Geoffrey Plantagenet, the elder brother of John. This usurpation, it is well  known, he afterwards effected. His own character being light, profligate, and  perfidious, John easily attached to his person and faction, not only all who  had reason to dread the resentment of Richard for criminal proceedings during  his absence, but also the numerous class of &ldquo;lawless resolutes,&rdquo;  whom the crusades had turned back on their country, accomplished in the vices  of the East, impoverished in substance, and hardened in character, and who  placed their hopes of harvest in civil commotion. To these causes of public  distress and apprehension, must be added, the multitude of outlaws, who, driven  to despair by the oppression of the feudal nobility, and the severe exercise of  the forest laws, banded together in large gangs, and, keeping possession of the  forests and the wastes, set at defiance the justice and magistracy of the  country. The nobles themselves, each fortified within his own castle, and  playing the petty sovereign over his own dominions, were the leaders of bands  scarce less lawless and oppressive than those of the avowed depredators. To  maintain these retainers, and to support the extravagance and magnificence  which their pride induced them to affect, the nobility borrowed sums of money  from the Jews at the most usurious interest, which gnawed into their estates  like consuming cankers, scarce to be cured unless when circumstances gave them  an opportunity of getting free, by exercising upon their creditors some act of  unprincipled violence.          Under the various burdens imposed by this unhappy state of affairs, the people  of England suffered deeply for the present, and had yet more dreadful cause to  fear for the future. To augment their misery, a contagious disorder of a  dangerous nature spread through the land; and, rendered more virulent by the  uncleanness, the indifferent food, and the wretched lodging of the lower  classes, swept off many whose fate the survivors were tempted to envy, as  exempting them from the evils which were to come.          Yet amid these accumulated distresses, the poor as well as the rich, the vulgar  as well as the noble, in the event of a tournament, which was the grand  spectacle of that age, felt as much interested as the half-starved citizen of  Madrid, who has not a real left to buy provisions for his family, feels in the  issue of a bull-feast. Neither duty nor infirmity could keep youth or age from  such exhibitions. The Passage of Arms, as it was called, which was to take  place at Ashby, in the county of Leicester, as champions of the first renown  were to take the field in the presence of Prince John himself, who was expected  to grace the lists, had attracted universal attention, and an immense  confluence of persons of all ranks hastened upon the appointed morning to the  place of combat.          The scene was singularly romantic. On the verge of a wood, which approached to  within a mile of the town of Ashby, was an extensive meadow, of the finest and  most beautiful green turf, surrounded on one side by the forest, and fringed on  the other by straggling oak-trees, some of which had grown to an immense size.  The ground, as if fashioned on purpose for the martial display which was  intended, sloped gradually down on all sides to a level bottom, which was  enclosed for the lists with strong palisades, forming a space of a quarter of a  mile in length, and about half as broad. The form of the enclosure was an  oblong square, save that the corners were considerably rounded off, in order to  afford more convenience for the spectators. The openings for the entry of the  combatants were at the northern and southern extremities of the lists,  accessible by strong wooden gates, each wide enough to admit two horsemen  riding abreast. At each of these portals were stationed two heralds, attended  by six trumpets, as many pursuivants, and a strong body of men-at-arms for  maintaining order, and ascertaining the quality of the knights who proposed to  engage in this martial game.          On a platform beyond the southern entrance, formed by a natural elevation of  the ground, were pitched five magnificent pavilions, adorned with pennons of  russet and black, the chosen colours of the five knights challengers. The cords  of the tents were of the same colour. Before each pavilion was suspended the  shield of the knight by whom it was occupied, and beside it stood his squire,  quaintly disguised as a salvage or silvan man, or in some other fantastic  dress, according to the taste of his master, and the character he was pleased  to assume during the game.   16            The central pavilion, as the place of honour, had been assigned to Brian be  Bois-Guilbert, whose renown in all games of chivalry, no less than his  connexions with the knights who had undertaken this Passage of Arms, had  occasioned him to be eagerly received into the company of the challengers, and  even adopted as their chief and leader, though he had so recently joined them.  On one side of his tent were pitched those of Reginald Front-de-Bœuf and  Richard de Malvoisin, and on the other was the pavilion of Hugh de Grantmesnil,  a noble baron in the vicinity, whose ancestor had been Lord High Steward of  England in the time of the Conqueror, and his son William Rufus. Ralph de  Vipont, a knight of St John of Jerusalem, who had some ancient possessions at a  place called Heather, near Ashby-de-la-Zouche, occupied the fifth pavilion.  From the entrance into the lists, a gently sloping passage, ten yards in  breadth, led up to the platform on which the tents were pitched. It was  strongly secured by a palisade on each side, as was the esplanade in front of  the pavilions, and the whole was guarded by men-at-arms.          The northern access to the lists terminated in a similar entrance of thirty  feet in breadth, at the extremity of which was a large enclosed space for such  knights as might be disposed to enter the lists with the challengers, behind  which were placed tents containing refreshments of every kind for their  accommodation, with armourers, tarriers, and other attendants, in readiness to  give their services wherever they might be necessary.          The exterior of the lists was in part occupied by temporary galleries, spread  with tapestry and carpets, and accommodated with cushions for the convenience  of those ladies and nobles who were expected to attend the tournament. A narrow  space, betwixt these galleries and the lists, gave accommodation for yeomanry  and spectators of a better degree than the mere vulgar, and might be compared  to the pit of a theatre. The promiscuous multitude arranged themselves upon  large banks of turf prepared for the purpose, which, aided by the natural  elevation of the ground, enabled them to overlook the galleries, and obtain a  fair view into the lists. Besides the accommodation which these stations  afforded, many hundreds had perched themselves on the branches of the trees  which surrounded the meadow; and even the steeple of a country church, at some  distance, was crowded with spectators.          It only remains to notice respecting the general arrangement, that one gallery  in the very centre of the eastern side of the lists, and consequently exactly  opposite to the spot where the shock of the combat was to take place, was  raised higher than the others, more richly decorated, and graced by a sort of  throne and canopy, on which the royal arms were emblazoned. Squires, pages, and  yeomen in rich liveries, waited around this place of honour, which was designed  for Prince John and his attendants. Opposite to this royal gallery was another,  elevated to the same height, on the western side of the lists; and more gaily,  if less sumptuously decorated, than that destined for the Prince himself. A  train of pages and of young maidens, the most beautiful who could be selected,  gaily dressed in fancy habits of green and pink, surrounded a throne decorated  in the same colours. Among pennons and flags bearing wounded hearts, burning  hearts, bleeding hearts, bows and quivers, and all the commonplace emblems of  the triumphs of Cupid, a blazoned inscription informed the spectators, that  this seat of honour was designed for &ldquo;La Royne de las Beaulte et des  Amours&rdquo;. But who was to represent the Queen of Beauty and of Love on the  present occasion no one was prepared to guess.          Meanwhile, spectators of every description thronged forward to occupy their  respective stations, and not without many quarrels concerning those which they  were entitled to hold. Some of these were settled by the men-at-arms with brief  ceremony; the shafts of their battle-axes, and pummels of their swords, being  readily employed as arguments to convince the more refractory. Others, which  involved the rival claims of more elevated persons, were determined by the  heralds, or by the two marshals of the field, William de Wyvil, and Stephen de  Martival, who, armed at all points, rode up and down the lists to enforce and  preserve good order among the spectators.          Gradually the galleries became filled with knights and nobles, in their robes  of peace, whose long and rich-tinted mantles were contrasted with the gayer and  more splendid habits of the ladies, who, in a greater proportion than even the  men themselves, thronged to witness a sport, which one would have thought too  bloody and dangerous to afford their sex much pleasure. The lower and interior  space was soon filled by substantial yeomen and burghers, and such of the  lesser gentry, as, from modesty, poverty, or dubious title, durst not assume  any higher place. It was of course amongst these that the most frequent  disputes for precedence occurred.          &ldquo;Dog of an unbeliever,&rdquo; said an old man, whose threadbare tunic  bore witness to his poverty, as his sword, and dagger, and golden chain  intimated his pretensions to rank,&mdash;&ldquo;whelp of a she-wolf! darest  thou press upon a Christian, and a Norman gentleman of the blood of  Montdidier?&rdquo;          This rough expostulation was addressed to no other than our acquaintance Isaac,  who, richly and even magnificently dressed in a gaberdine ornamented with lace  and lined with fur, was endeavouring to make place in the foremost row beneath  the gallery for his daughter, the beautiful Rebecca, who had joined him at  Ashby, and who was now hanging on her father&rsquo;s arm, not a little  terrified by the popular displeasure which seemed generally excited by her  parent&rsquo;s presumption. But Isaac, though we have seen him sufficiently  timid on other occasions, knew well that at present he had nothing to fear. It  was not in places of general resort, or where their equals were assembled, that  any avaricious or malevolent noble durst offer him injury. At such meetings the  Jews were under the protection of the general law; and if that proved a weak  assurance, it usually happened that there were among the persons assembled some  barons, who, for their own interested motives, were ready to act as their  protectors. On the present occasion, Isaac felt more than usually confident,  being aware that Prince John was even then in the very act of negotiating a  large loan from the Jews of York, to be secured upon certain jewels and lands.  Isaac&rsquo;s own share in this transaction was considerable, and he well knew  that the Prince&rsquo;s eager desire to bring it to a conclusion would ensure  him his protection in the dilemma in which he stood.          Emboldened by these considerations, the Jew pursued his point, and jostled the  Norman Christian, without respect either to his descent, quality, or religion.  The complaints of the old man, however, excited the indignation of the  bystanders. One of these, a stout well-set yeoman, arrayed in Lincoln green,  having twelve arrows stuck in his belt, with a baldric and badge of silver, and  a bow of six feet length in his hand, turned short round, and while his  countenance, which his constant exposure to weather had rendered brown as a  hazel nut, grew darker with anger, he advised the Jew to remember that all the  wealth he had acquired by sucking the blood of his miserable victims had but  swelled him like a bloated spider, which might be overlooked while he kept in a  corner, but would be crushed if it ventured into the light. This intimation,  delivered in Norman-English with a firm voice and a stern aspect, made the Jew  shrink back; and he would have probably withdrawn himself altogether from a  vicinity so dangerous, had not the attention of every one been called to the  sudden entrance of Prince John, who at that moment entered the lists, attended  by a numerous and gay train, consisting partly of laymen, partly of churchmen,  as light in their dress, and as gay in their demeanour, as their companions.  Among the latter was the Prior of Jorvaulx, in the most gallant trim which a  dignitary of the church could venture to exhibit. Fur and gold were not spared  in his garments; and the points of his boots, out-heroding the preposterous  fashion of the time, turned up so very far, as to be attached, not to his knees  merely, but to his very girdle, and effectually prevented him from putting his  foot into the stirrup. This, however, was a slight inconvenience to the gallant  Abbot, who, perhaps, even rejoicing in the opportunity to display his  accomplished horsemanship before so many spectators, especially of the fair  sex, dispensed with the use of these supports to a timid rider. The rest of  Prince John&rsquo;s retinue consisted of the favourite leaders of his mercenary  troops, some marauding barons and profligate attendants upon the court, with  several Knights Templars and Knights of St John.          It may be here remarked, that the knights of these two orders were accounted  hostile to King Richard, having adopted the side of Philip of France in the  long train of disputes which took place in Palestine betwixt that monarch and  the lion-hearted King of England. It was the well-known consequence of this  discord that Richard&rsquo;s repeated victories had been rendered fruitless,  his romantic attempts to besiege Jerusalem disappointed, and the fruit of all  the glory which he had acquired had dwindled into an uncertain truce with the  Sultan Saladin. With the same policy which had dictated the conduct of their  brethren in the Holy Land, the Templars and Hospitallers in England and  Normandy attached themselves to the faction of Prince John, having little  reason to desire the return of Richard to England, or the succession of Arthur,  his legitimate heir. For the opposite reason, Prince John hated and contemned  the few Saxon families of consequence which subsisted in England, and omitted  no opportunity of mortifying and affronting them; being conscious that his  person and pretensions were disliked by them, as well as by the greater part of  the English commons, who feared farther innovation upon their rights and  liberties, from a sovereign of John&rsquo;s licentious and tyrannical  disposition.          Attended by this gallant equipage, himself well mounted, and splendidly dressed  in crimson and in gold, bearing upon his hand a falcon, and having his head  covered by a rich fur bonnet, adorned with a circle of precious stones, from  which his long curled hair escaped and overspread his shoulders, Prince John,  upon a grey and high-mettled palfrey, caracoled within the lists at the head of  his jovial party, laughing loud with his train, and eyeing with all the  boldness of royal criticism the beauties who adorned the lofty galleries.          Those who remarked in the physiognomy of the Prince a dissolute audacity,  mingled with extreme haughtiness and indifference to the feelings of others  could not yet deny to his countenance that sort of comeliness which belongs to  an open set of features, well formed by nature, modelled by art to the usual  rules of courtesy, yet so far frank and honest, that they seemed as if they  disclaimed to conceal the natural workings of the soul. Such an expression is  often mistaken for manly frankness, when in truth it arises from the reckless  indifference of a libertine disposition, conscious of superiority of birth, of  wealth, or of some other adventitious advantage, totally unconnected with  personal merit. To those who did not think so deeply, and they were the greater  number by a hundred to one, the splendour of Prince John&rsquo;s  &ldquo;rheno&rdquo;, (i.e. fur tippet,) the richness of his cloak, lined with  the most costly sables, his maroquin boots and golden spurs, together with the  grace with which he managed his palfrey, were sufficient to merit clamorous  applause.          In his joyous caracole round the lists, the attention of the Prince was called  by the commotion, not yet subsided, which had attended the ambitious movement  of Isaac towards the higher places of the assembly. The quick eye of Prince  John instantly recognised the Jew, but was much more agreeably attracted by the  beautiful daughter of Zion, who, terrified by the tumult, clung close to the  arm of her aged father.          The figure of Rebecca might indeed have compared with the proudest beauties of  England, even though it had been judged by as shrewd a connoisseur as Prince  John. Her form was exquisitely symmetrical, and was shown to advantage by a  sort of Eastern dress, which she wore according to the fashion of the females  of her nation. Her turban of yellow silk suited well with the darkness of her  complexion. The brilliancy of her eyes, the superb arch of her eyebrows, her  well-formed aquiline nose, her teeth as white as pearl, and the profusion of  her sable tresses, which, each arranged in its own little spiral of twisted  curls, fell down upon as much of a lovely neck and bosom as a simarre of the  richest Persian silk, exhibiting flowers in their natural colours embossed upon  a purple ground, permitted to be visible&mdash;all these constituted a  combination of loveliness, which yielded not to the most beautiful of the  maidens who surrounded her. It is true, that of the golden and pearl-studded  clasps, which closed her vest from the throat to the waist, the three uppermost  were left unfastened on account of the heat, which somewhat enlarged the  prospect to which we allude. A diamond necklace, with pendants of inestimable  value, were by this means also made more conspicuous. The feather of an  ostrich, fastened in her turban by an agraffe set with brilliants, was another  distinction of the beautiful Jewess, scoffed and sneered at by the proud dames  who sat above her, but secretly envied by those who affected to deride them.          &ldquo;By the bald scalp of Abraham,&rdquo; said Prince John, &ldquo;yonder  Jewess must be the very model of that perfection, whose charms drove frantic  the wisest king that ever lived! What sayest thou, Prior Aymer?&mdash;By the  Temple of that wise king, which our wiser brother Richard proved unable to  recover, she is the very Bride of the Canticles!&rdquo;          &ldquo;The Rose of Sharon and the Lily of the Valley,&rdquo;&mdash;answered the  Prior, in a sort of snuffling tone; &ldquo;but your Grace must remember she is  still but a Jewess.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; added Prince John, without heeding him, &ldquo;and there is  my Mammon of unrighteousness too&mdash;the Marquis of Marks, the Baron of  Byzants, contesting for place with penniless dogs, whose threadbare cloaks have  not a single cross in their pouches to keep the devil from dancing there. By  the body of St Mark, my prince of supplies, with his lovely Jewess, shall have  a place in the gallery!&mdash;What is she, Isaac? Thy wife or thy daughter,  that Eastern houri that thou lockest under thy arm as thou wouldst thy  treasure-casket?&rdquo;          &ldquo;My daughter Rebecca, so please your Grace,&rdquo; answered Isaac, with a  low congee, nothing embarrassed by the Prince&rsquo;s salutation, in which,  however, there was at least as much mockery as courtesy.          &ldquo;The wiser man thou,&rdquo; said John, with a peal of laughter, in which  his gay followers obsequiously joined. &ldquo;But, daughter or wife, she should  be preferred according to her beauty and thy merits.&mdash;Who sits above  there?&rdquo; he continued, bending his eye on the gallery. &ldquo;Saxon  churls, lolling at their lazy length!&mdash;out upon them!&mdash;let them sit  close, and make room for my prince of usurers and his lovely daughter.  I&rsquo;ll make the hinds know they must share the high places of the synagogue  with those whom the synagogue properly belongs to.&rdquo;          Those who occupied the gallery to whom this injurious and unpolite speech was  addressed, were the family of Cedric the Saxon, with that of his ally and  kinsman, Athelstane of Coningsburgh, a personage, who, on account of his  descent from the last Saxon monarchs of England, was held in the highest  respect by all the Saxon natives of the north of England. But with the blood of  this ancient royal race, many of their infirmities had descended to Athelstane.  He was comely in countenance, bulky and strong in person, and in the flower of  his age&mdash;yet inanimate in expression, dull-eyed, heavy-browed, inactive  and sluggish in all his motions, and so slow in resolution, that the soubriquet  of one of his ancestors was conferred upon him, and he was very generally  called Athelstane the Unready. His friends, and he had many, who, as well as  Cedric, were passionately attached to him, contended that this sluggish temper  arose not from want of courage, but from mere want of decision; others alleged  that his hereditary vice of drunkenness had obscured his faculties, never of a  very acute order, and that the passive courage and meek good-nature which  remained behind, were merely the dregs of a character that might have been  deserving of praise, but of which all the valuable parts had flown off in the  progress of a long course of brutal debauchery.          It was to this person, such as we have described him, that the Prince addressed  his imperious command to make place for Isaac and Rebecca. Athelstane, utterly  confounded at an order which the manners and feelings of the times rendered so  injuriously insulting, unwilling to obey, yet undetermined how to resist,  opposed only the &ldquo;vis inertiae&rdquo; to the will of John; and, without  stirring or making any motion whatever of obedience, opened his large grey  eyes, and stared at the Prince with an astonishment which had in it something  extremely ludicrous. But the impatient John regarded it in no such light.          &ldquo;The Saxon porker,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is either asleep or minds me  not&mdash;Prick him with your lance, De Bracy,&rdquo; speaking to a knight who  rode near him, the leader of a band of Free Companions, or Condottieri; that  is, of mercenaries belonging to no particular nation, but attached for the time  to any prince by whom they were paid. There was a murmur even among the  attendants of Prince John; but De Bracy, whose profession freed him from all  scruples, extended his long lance over the space which separated the gallery  from the lists, and would have executed the commands of the Prince before  Athelstane the Unready had recovered presence of mind sufficient even to draw  back his person from the weapon, had not Cedric, as prompt as his companion was  tardy, unsheathed, with the speed of lightning, the short sword which he wore,  and at a single blow severed the point of the lance from the handle. The blood  rushed into the countenance of Prince John. He swore one of his deepest oaths,  and was about to utter some threat corresponding in violence, when he was  diverted from his purpose, partly by his own attendants, who gathered around  him conjuring him to be patient, partly by a general exclamation of the crowd,  uttered in loud applause of the spirited conduct of Cedric. The Prince rolled  his eyes in indignation, as if to collect some safe and easy victim; and  chancing to encounter the firm glance of the same archer whom we have already  noticed, and who seemed to persist in his gesture of applause, in spite of the  frowning aspect which the Prince bent upon him, he demanded his reason for  clamouring thus.          &ldquo;I always add my hollo,&rdquo; said the yeoman, &ldquo;when I see a good  shot, or a gallant blow.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Sayst thou?&rdquo; answered the Prince; &ldquo;then thou canst hit the  white thyself, I&rsquo;ll warrant.&rdquo;          &ldquo;A woodsman&rsquo;s mark, and at woodsman&rsquo;s distance, I can  hit,&rdquo; answered the yeoman.          &ldquo;And Wat Tyrrel&rsquo;s mark, at a hundred yards,&rdquo; said a voice  from behind, but by whom uttered could not be discerned.          This allusion to the fate of William Rufus, his Relative, at once incensed and  alarmed Prince John. He satisfied himself, however, with commanding the  men-at-arms, who surrounded the lists, to keep an eye on the braggart, pointing  to the yeoman.          &ldquo;By St Grizzel,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;we will try his own skill, who is  so ready to give his voice to the feats of others!&rdquo;          &ldquo;I shall not fly the trial,&rdquo; said the yeoman, with the composure  which marked his whole deportment.          &ldquo;Meanwhile, stand up, ye Saxon churls,&rdquo; said the fiery Prince;  &ldquo;for, by the light of Heaven, since I have said it, the Jew shall have  his seat amongst ye!&rdquo;          &ldquo;By no means, an it please your Grace!&mdash;it is not fit for such as we  to sit with the rulers of the land,&rdquo; said the Jew; whose ambition for  precedence though it had led him to dispute Place with the extenuated and  impoverished descendant of the line of Montdidier, by no means stimulated him  to an intrusion upon the privileges of the wealthy Saxons.          &ldquo;Up, infidel dog when I command you,&rdquo; said Prince John, &ldquo;or I  will have thy swarthy hide stript off, and tanned for horse-furniture.&rdquo;          Thus urged, the Jew began to ascend the steep and narrow steps which led up to  the gallery.          &ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;who dare stop him,&rdquo;  fixing his eye on Cedric, whose attitude intimated his intention to hurl the  Jew down headlong.          The catastrophe was prevented by the clown Wamba, who, springing betwixt his  master and Isaac, and exclaiming, in answer to the Prince&rsquo;s defiance,  &ldquo;Marry, that will I!&rdquo; opposed to the beard of the Jew a shield of  brawn, which he plucked from beneath his cloak, and with which, doubtless, he  had furnished himself, lest the tournament should have proved longer than his  appetite could endure abstinence. Finding the abomination of his tribe opposed  to his very nose, while the Jester, at the same time, flourished his wooden  sword above his head, the Jew recoiled, missed his footing, and rolled down the  steps,&mdash;an excellent jest to the spectators, who set up a loud laughter,  in which Prince John and his attendants heartily joined.          &ldquo;Deal me the prize, cousin Prince,&rdquo; said Wamba; &ldquo;I have  vanquished my foe in fair fight with sword and shield,&rdquo; he added,  brandishing the brawn in one hand and the wooden sword in the other.          &ldquo;Who, and what art thou, noble champion?&rdquo; said Prince John, still  laughing.          &ldquo;A fool by right of descent,&rdquo; answered the Jester; &ldquo;I am  Wamba, the son of Witless, who was the son of Weatherbrain, who was the son of  an Alderman.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Make room for the Jew in front of the lower ring,&rdquo; said Prince  John, not unwilling perhaps to seize an apology to desist from his original  purpose; &ldquo;to place the vanquished beside the victor were false  heraldry.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Knave upon fool were worse,&rdquo; answered the Jester, &ldquo;and Jew  upon bacon worst of all.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Gramercy! good fellow,&rdquo; cried Prince John, &ldquo;thou pleasest  me&mdash;Here, Isaac, lend me a handful of byzants.&rdquo;          As the Jew, stunned by the request, afraid to refuse, and unwilling to comply,  fumbled in the furred bag which hung by his girdle, and was perhaps  endeavouring to ascertain how few coins might pass for a handful, the Prince  stooped from his jennet and settled Isaac&rsquo;s doubts by snatching the pouch  itself from his side; and flinging to Wamba a couple of the gold pieces which  it contained, he pursued his career round the lists, leaving the Jew to the  derision of those around him, and himself receiving as much applause from the  spectators as if he had done some honest and honourable action.                     CHAPTER VIII        At this the challenger with fierce defy   His trumpet sounds; the challenged makes reply:   With clangour rings the field, resounds the vaulted sky.   Their visors closed, their lances in the rest,   Or at the helmet pointed or the crest,   They vanish from the barrier, speed the race,   And spurring see decrease the middle space.           P ALAMON AND  A RCITE           In the midst of Prince John&rsquo;s cavalcade, he suddenly stopt, and appealing  to the Prior of Jorvaulx, declared the principal business of the day had been  forgotten.          &ldquo;By my halidom,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we have forgotten, Sir Prior, to  name the fair Sovereign of Love and of Beauty, by whose white hand the palm is  to be distributed. For my part, I am liberal in my ideas, and I care not if I  give my vote for the black-eyed Rebecca.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Holy Virgin,&rdquo; answered the Prior, turning up his eyes in horror,  &ldquo;a Jewess!&mdash;We should deserve to be stoned out of the lists; and I  am not yet old enough to be a martyr. Besides, I swear by my patron saint, that  she is far inferior to the lovely Saxon, Rowena.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Saxon or Jew,&rdquo; answered the Prince, &ldquo;Saxon or Jew, dog or  hog, what matters it? I say, name Rebecca, were it only to mortify the Saxon  churls.&rdquo;          A murmur arose even among his own immediate attendants.          &ldquo;This passes a jest, my lord,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;no knight here  will lay lance in rest if such an insult is attempted.&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is the mere wantonness of insult,&rdquo; said one of the oldest and  most important of Prince John&rsquo;s followers, Waldemar Fitzurse, &ldquo;and  if your Grace attempt it, cannot but prove ruinous to your projects.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I entertained you, sir,&rdquo; said John, reining up his palfrey  haughtily, &ldquo;for my follower, but not for my counsellor.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Those who follow your Grace in the paths which you tread,&rdquo; said  Waldemar, but speaking in a low voice, &ldquo;acquire the right of counsellors;  for your interest and safety are not more deeply gaged than their own.&rdquo;          From the tone in which this was spoken, John saw the necessity of acquiescence.  &ldquo;I did but jest,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and you turn upon me like so many  adders! Name whom you will, in the fiend&rsquo;s name, and please  yourselves.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;let the fair sovereign&rsquo;s  throne remain unoccupied, until the conqueror shall be named, and then let him  choose the lady by whom it shall be filled. It will add another grace to his  triumph, and teach fair ladies to prize the love of valiant knights, who can  exalt them to such distinction.&rdquo;          &ldquo;If Brian de Bois-Guilbert gain the prize,&rdquo; said the Prior,  &ldquo;I will gage my rosary that I name the Sovereign of Love and  Beauty.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Bois-Guilbert,&rdquo; answered De Bracy, &ldquo;is a good lance; but  there are others around these lists, Sir Prior, who will not fear to encounter  him.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Silence, sirs,&rdquo; said Waldemar, &ldquo;and let the Prince assume  his seat. The knights and spectators are alike impatient, the time advances,  and highly fit it is that the sports should commence.&rdquo;          Prince John, though not yet a monarch, had in Waldemar Fitzurse all the  inconveniences of a favourite minister, who, in serving his sovereign, must  always do so in his own way. The Prince acquiesced, however, although his  disposition was precisely of that kind which is apt to be obstinate upon  trifles, and, assuming his throne, and being surrounded by his followers, gave  signal to the heralds to proclaim the laws of the tournament, which were  briefly as follows:          First, the five challengers were to undertake all comers.          Secondly, any knight proposing to combat, might, if he pleased, select a  special antagonist from among the challengers, by touching his shield. If he  did so with the reverse of his lance, the trial of skill was made with what  were called the arms of courtesy, that is, with lances at whose extremity a  piece of round flat board was fixed, so that no danger was encountered, save  from the shock of the horses and riders. But if the shield was touched with the  sharp end of the lance, the combat was understood to be at  &ldquo;outrance&rdquo;, that is, the knights were to fight with sharp weapons,  as in actual battle.          Thirdly, when the knights present had accomplished their vow, by each of them  breaking five lances, the Prince was to declare the victor in the first  day&rsquo;s tourney, who should receive as prize a warhorse of exquisite beauty  and matchless strength; and in addition to this reward of valour, it was now  declared, he should have the peculiar honour of naming the Queen of Love and  Beauty, by whom the prize should be given on the ensuing day.          Fourthly, it was announced, that, on the second day, there should be a general  tournament, in which all the knights present, who were desirous to win praise,  might take part; and being divided into two bands of equal numbers, might fight  it out manfully, until the signal was given by Prince John to cease the combat.  The elected Queen of Love and Beauty was then to crown the knight whom the  Prince should adjudge to have borne himself best in this second day, with a  coronet composed of thin gold plate, cut into the shape of a laurel crown. On  this second day the knightly games ceased. But on that which was to follow,  feats of archery, of bull-baiting, and other popular amusements, were to be  practised, for the more immediate amusement of the populace. In this manner did  Prince John endeavour to lay the foundation of a popularity, which he was  perpetually throwing down by some inconsiderate act of wanton aggression upon  the feelings and prejudices of the people.          The lists now presented a most splendid spectacle. The sloping galleries were  crowded with all that was noble, great, wealthy, and beautiful in the northern  and midland parts of England; and the contrast of the various dresses of these  dignified spectators, rendered the view as gay as it was rich, while the  interior and lower space, filled with the substantial burgesses and yeomen of  merry England, formed, in their more plain attire, a dark fringe, or border,  around this circle of brilliant embroidery, relieving, and, at the same time,  setting off its splendour.          The heralds finished their proclamation with their usual cry of  &ldquo;Largesse, largesse, gallant knights!&rdquo; and gold and silver pieces  were showered on them from the galleries, it being a high point of chivalry to  exhibit liberality towards those whom the age accounted at once the secretaries  and the historians of honour. The bounty of the spectators was acknowledged by  the customary shouts of &ldquo;Love of Ladies&mdash;Death of  Champions&mdash;Honour to the Generous&mdash;Glory to the Brave!&rdquo; To  which the more humble spectators added their acclamations, and a numerous band  of trumpeters the flourish of their martial instruments. When these sounds had  ceased, the heralds withdrew from the lists in gay and glittering procession,  and none remained within them save the marshals of the field, who, armed  cap-a-pie, sat on horseback, motionless as statues, at the opposite ends of the  lists. Meantime, the enclosed space at the northern extremity of the lists,  large as it was, was now completely crowded with knights desirous to prove  their skill against the challengers, and, when viewed from the galleries,  presented the appearance of a sea of waving plumage, intermixed with glistening  helmets, and tall lances, to the extremities of which were, in many cases,  attached small pennons of about a span&rsquo;s breadth, which, fluttering in  the air as the breeze caught them, joined with the restless motion of the  feathers to add liveliness to the scene.          At length the barriers were opened, and five knights, chosen by lot, advanced  slowly into the area; a single champion riding in front, and the other four  following in pairs. All were splendidly armed, and my Saxon authority (in the  Wardour Manuscript) records at great length their devices, their colours, and  the embroidery of their horse trappings. It is unnecessary to be particular on  these subjects. To borrow lines from a contemporary poet, who has written but  too little:          &ldquo;The knights are dust,   And their good swords are rust,   Their souls are with the saints, we trust.&rdquo;  17           Their escutcheons have long mouldered from the walls of their castles. Their  castles themselves are but green mounds and shattered ruins&mdash;the place  that once knew them, knows them no more&mdash;nay, many a race since theirs has  died out and been forgotten in the very land which they occupied, with all the  authority of feudal proprietors and feudal lords. What, then, would it avail  the reader to know their names, or the evanescent symbols of their martial  rank!          Now, however, no whit anticipating the oblivion which awaited their names and  feats, the champions advanced through the lists, restraining their fiery  steeds, and compelling them to move slowly, while, at the same time, they  exhibited their paces, together with the grace and dexterity of the riders. As  the procession entered the lists, the sound of a wild Barbaric music was heard  from behind the tents of the challengers, where the performers were concealed.  It was of Eastern origin, having been brought from the Holy Land; and the  mixture of the cymbals and bells seemed to bid welcome at once, and defiance,  to the knights as they advanced. With the eyes of an immense concourse of  spectators fixed upon them, the five knights advanced up the platform upon  which the tents of the challengers stood, and there separating themselves, each  touched slightly, and with the reverse of his lance, the shield of the  antagonist to whom he wished to oppose himself. The lower orders of spectators  in general&mdash;nay, many of the higher class, and it is even said several of  the ladies, were rather disappointed at the champions choosing the arms of  courtesy. For the same sort of persons, who, in the present day, applaud most  highly the deepest tragedies, were then interested in a tournament exactly in  proportion to the danger incurred by the champions engaged.          Having intimated their more pacific purpose, the champions retreated to the  extremity of the lists, where they remained drawn up in a line; while the  challengers, sallying each from his pavilion, mounted their horses, and, headed  by Brian de Bois-Guilbert, descended from the platform, and opposed themselves  individually to the knights who had touched their respective shields.          At the flourish of clarions and trumpets, they started out against each other  at full gallop; and such was the superior dexterity or good fortune of the  challengers, that those opposed to Bois-Guilbert, Malvoisin, and  Front-de-Bœuf, rolled on the ground. The antagonist of Grantmesnil, instead of  bearing his lance-point fair against the crest or the shield of his enemy,  swerved so much from the direct line as to break the weapon athwart the person  of his opponent&mdash;a circumstance which was accounted more disgraceful than  that of being actually unhorsed; because the latter might happen from accident,  whereas the former evinced awkwardness and want of management of the weapon and  of the horse. The fifth knight alone maintained the honour of his party, and  parted fairly with the Knight of St John, both splintering their lances without  advantage on either side.          The shouts of the multitude, together with the acclamations of the heralds, and  the clangour of the trumpets, announced the triumph of the victors and the  defeat of the vanquished. The former retreated to their pavilions, and the  latter, gathering themselves up as they could, withdrew from the lists in  disgrace and dejection, to agree with their victors concerning the redemption  of their arms and their horses, which, according to the laws of the tournament,  they had forfeited. The fifth of their number alone tarried in the lists long  enough to be greeted by the applauses of the spectators, amongst whom he  retreated, to the aggravation, doubtless, of his companions&rsquo;  mortification.          A second and a third party of knights took the field; and although they had  various success, yet, upon the whole, the advantage decidedly remained with the  challengers, not one of whom lost his seat or swerved from his  charge&mdash;misfortunes which befell one or two of their antagonists in each  encounter. The spirits, therefore, of those opposed to them, seemed to be  considerably damped by their continued success. Three knights only appeared on  the fourth entry, who, avoiding the shields of Bois-Guilbert and  Front-de-Bœuf, contented themselves with touching those of the three other  knights, who had not altogether manifested the same strength and dexterity.  This politic selection did not alter the fortune of the field, the challengers  were still successful: one of their antagonists was overthrown, and both the  others failed in the &ldquo;attaint&rdquo;,   18   that is, in  striking the helmet and shield of their antagonist firmly and strongly, with  the lance held in a direct line, so that the weapon might break unless the  champion was overthrown.          After this fourth encounter, there was a considerable pause; nor did it appear  that any one was very desirous of renewing the contest. The spectators murmured  among themselves; for, among the challengers, Malvoisin and Front-de-Bœuf were  unpopular from their characters, and the others, except Grantmesnil, were  disliked as strangers and foreigners.          But none shared the general feeling of dissatisfaction so keenly as Cedric the  Saxon, who saw, in each advantage gained by the Norman challengers, a repeated  triumph over the honour of England. His own education had taught him no skill  in the games of chivalry, although, with the arms of his Saxon ancestors, he  had manifested himself, on many occasions, a brave and determined soldier. He  looked anxiously to Athelstane, who had learned the accomplishments of the age,  as if desiring that he should make some personal effort to recover the victory  which was passing into the hands of the Templar and his associates. But, though  both stout of heart, and strong of person, Athelstane had a disposition too  inert and unambitious to make the exertions which Cedric seemed to expect from  him.          &ldquo;The day is against England, my lord,&rdquo; said Cedric, in a marked  tone; &ldquo;are you not tempted to take the lance?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I shall tilt to-morrow&rdquo; answered Athelstane, &ldquo;in the  &lsquo;melee&rsquo;; it is not worth while for me to arm myself to-day.&rdquo;          Two things displeased Cedric in this speech. It contained the Norman word  &ldquo;melee&rdquo;, (to express the general conflict,) and it evinced some  indifference to the honour of the country; but it was spoken by Athelstane,  whom he held in such profound respect, that he would not trust himself to  canvass his motives or his foibles. Moreover, he had no time to make any  remark, for Wamba thrust in his word, observing, &ldquo;It was better, though  scarce easier, to be the best man among a hundred, than the best man of  two.&rdquo;          Athelstane took the observation as a serious compliment; but Cedric, who better  understood the Jester&rsquo;s meaning, darted at him a severe and menacing  look; and lucky it was for Wamba, perhaps, that the time and place prevented  his receiving, notwithstanding his place and service, more sensible marks of  his master&rsquo;s resentment.          The pause in the tournament was still uninterrupted, excepting by the voices of  the heralds exclaiming&mdash;&ldquo;Love of ladies, splintering of lances!  stand forth gallant knights, fair eyes look upon your deeds!&rdquo;          The music also of the challengers breathed from time to time wild bursts  expressive of triumph or defiance, while the clowns grudged a holiday which  seemed to pass away in inactivity; and old knights and nobles lamented in  whispers the decay of martial spirit, spoke of the triumphs of their younger  days, but agreed that the land did not now supply dames of such transcendent  beauty as had animated the jousts of former times. Prince John began to talk to  his attendants about making ready the banquet, and the necessity of adjudging  the prize to Brian de Bois-Guilbert, who had, with a single spear, overthrown  two knights, and foiled a third.          At length, as the Saracenic music of the challengers concluded one of those  long and high flourishes with which they had broken the silence of the lists,  it was answered by a solitary trumpet, which breathed a note of defiance from  the northern extremity. All eyes were turned to see the new champion which  these sounds announced, and no sooner were the barriers opened than he paced  into the lists. As far as could be judged of a man sheathed in armour, the new  adventurer did not greatly exceed the middle size, and seemed to be rather  slender than strongly made. His suit of armour was formed of steel, richly  inlaid with gold, and the device on his shield was a young oak-tree pulled up  by the roots, with the Spanish word Desdichado, signifying Disinherited. He was  mounted on a gallant black horse, and as he passed through the lists he  gracefully saluted the Prince and the ladies by lowering his lance. The  dexterity with which he managed his steed, and something of youthful grace  which he displayed in his manner, won him the favour of the multitude, which  some of the lower classes expressed by calling out, &ldquo;Touch Ralph de  Vipont&rsquo;s shield&mdash;touch the Hospitallers shield; he has the least  sure seat, he is your cheapest bargain.&rdquo;          The champion, moving onward amid these well-meant hints, ascended the platform  by the sloping alley which led to it from the lists, and, to the astonishment  of all present, riding straight up to the central pavilion, struck with the  sharp end of his spear the shield of Brian de Bois-Guilbert until it rung  again. All stood astonished at his presumption, but none more than the  redoubted Knight whom he had thus defied to mortal combat, and who, little  expecting so rude a challenge, was standing carelessly at the door of the  pavilion.          &ldquo;Have you confessed yourself, brother,&rdquo; said the Templar,  &ldquo;and have you heard mass this morning, that you peril your life so  frankly?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I am fitter to meet death than thou art&rdquo; answered the Disinherited  Knight; for by this name the stranger had recorded himself in the books of the  tourney.          &ldquo;Then take your place in the lists,&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert, &ldquo;and  look your last upon the sun; for this night thou shalt sleep in  paradise.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Gramercy for thy courtesy,&rdquo; replied the Disinherited Knight,  &ldquo;and to requite it, I advise thee to take a fresh horse and a new lance,  for by my honour you will need both.&rdquo;          Having expressed himself thus confidently, he reined his horse backward down  the slope which he had ascended, and compelled him in the same manner to move  backward through the lists, till he reached the northern extremity, where he  remained stationary, in expectation of his antagonist. This feat of  horsemanship again attracted the applause of the multitude.          However incensed at his adversary for the precautions which he recommended,  Brian de Bois-Guilbert did not neglect his advice; for his honour was too  nearly concerned, to permit his neglecting any means which might ensure victory  over his presumptuous opponent. He changed his horse for a proved and fresh one  of great strength and spirit. He chose a new and a tough spear, lest the wood  of the former might have been strained in the previous encounters he had  sustained. Lastly, he laid aside his shield, which had received some little  damage, and received another from his squires. His first had only borne the  general device of his rider, representing two knights riding upon one horse, an  emblem expressive of the original humility and poverty of the Templars,  qualities which they had since exchanged for the arrogance and wealth that  finally occasioned their suppression. Bois-Guilbert&rsquo;s new shield bore a  raven in full flight, holding in its claws a skull, and bearing the motto,  &ldquo;Gare le Corbeau&rdquo;.          When the two champions stood opposed to each other at the two extremities of  the lists, the public expectation was strained to the highest pitch. Few  augured the possibility that the encounter could terminate well for the  Disinherited Knight, yet his courage and gallantry secured the general good  wishes of the spectators.          The trumpets had no sooner given the signal, than the champions vanished from  their posts with the speed of lightning, and closed in the centre of the lists  with the shock of a thunderbolt. The lances burst into shivers up to the very  grasp, and it seemed at the moment that both knights had fallen, for the shock  had made each horse recoil backwards upon its haunches. The address of the  riders recovered their steeds by use of the bridle and spur; and having glared  on each other for an instant with eyes which seemed to flash fire through the  bars of their visors, each made a demi-volte, and, retiring to the extremity of  the lists, received a fresh lance from the attendants.          A loud shout from the spectators, waving of scarfs and handkerchiefs, and  general acclamations, attested the interest taken by the spectators in this  encounter; the most equal, as well as the best performed, which had graced the  day. But no sooner had the knights resumed their station, than the clamour of  applause was hushed into a silence, so deep and so dead, that it seemed the  multitude were afraid even to breathe.          A few minutes pause having been allowed, that the combatants and their horses  might recover breath, Prince John with his truncheon signed to the trumpets to  sound the onset. The champions a second time sprung from their stations, and  closed in the centre of the lists, with the same speed, the same dexterity, the  same violence, but not the same equal fortune as before.          In this second encounter, the Templar aimed at the centre of his  antagonist&rsquo;s shield, and struck it so fair and forcibly, that his spear  went to shivers, and the Disinherited Knight reeled in his saddle. On the other  hand, that champion had, in the beginning of his career, directed the point of  his lance towards Bois-Guilbert&rsquo;s shield, but, changing his aim almost in  the moment of encounter, he addressed it to the helmet, a mark more difficult  to hit, but which, if attained, rendered the shock more irresistible. Fair and  true he hit the Norman on the visor, where his lance&rsquo;s point kept hold of  the bars. Yet, even at this disadvantage, the Templar sustained his high  reputation; and had not the girths of his saddle burst, he might not have been  unhorsed. As it chanced, however, saddle, horse, and man, rolled on the ground  under a cloud of dust.                      To extricate himself from the stirrups and fallen steed, was to the Templar  scarce the work of a moment; and, stung with madness, both at his disgrace and  at the acclamations with which it was hailed by the spectators, he drew his  sword and waved it in defiance of his conqueror. The Disinherited Knight sprung  from his steed, and also unsheathed his sword. The marshals of the field,  however, spurred their horses between them, and reminded them, that the laws of  the tournament did not, on the present occasion, permit this species of  encounter.          &ldquo;We shall meet again, I trust,&rdquo; said the Templar, casting a  resentful glance at his antagonist; &ldquo;and where there are none to separate  us.&rdquo;          &ldquo;If we do not,&rdquo; said the Disinherited Knight, &ldquo;the fault  shall not be mine. On foot or horseback, with spear, with axe, or with sword, I  am alike ready to encounter thee.&rdquo;          More and angrier words would have been exchanged, but the marshals, crossing  their lances betwixt them, compelled them to separate. The Disinherited Knight  returned to his first station, and Bois-Guilbert to his tent, where he remained  for the rest of the day in an agony of despair.          Without alighting from his horse, the conqueror called for a bowl of wine, and  opening the beaver, or lower part of his helmet, announced that he quaffed it,  &ldquo;To all true English hearts, and to the confusion of foreign  tyrants.&rdquo; He then commanded his trumpet to sound a defiance to the  challengers, and desired a herald to announce to them, that he should make no  election, but was willing to encounter them in the order in which they pleased  to advance against him.          The gigantic Front-de-Bœuf, armed in sable armour, was the first who took the  field. He bore on a white shield a black bull&rsquo;s head, half defaced by the  numerous encounters which he had undergone, and bearing the arrogant motto,  &ldquo;Cave, Adsum&rdquo;. Over this champion the Disinherited Knight obtained  a slight but decisive advantage. Both Knights broke their lances fairly, but  Front-de-Bœuf, who lost a stirrup in the encounter, was adjudged to have the  disadvantage.          In the stranger&rsquo;s third encounter with Sir Philip Malvoisin, he was  equally successful; striking that baron so forcibly on the casque, that the  laces of the helmet broke, and Malvoisin, only saved from falling by being  unhelmeted, was declared vanquished like his companions.          In his fourth combat with De Grantmesnil, the Disinherited Knight showed as  much courtesy as he had hitherto evinced courage and dexterity. De  Grantmesnil&rsquo;s horse, which was young and violent, reared and plunged in  the course of the career so as to disturb the rider&rsquo;s aim, and the  stranger, declining to take the advantage which this accident afforded him,  raised his lance, and passing his antagonist without touching him, wheeled his  horse and rode back again to his own end of the lists, offering his antagonist,  by a herald, the chance of a second encounter. This De Grantmesnil declined,  avowing himself vanquished as much by the courtesy as by the address of his  opponent.          Ralph de Vipont summed up the list of the stranger&rsquo;s triumphs, being  hurled to the ground with such force, that the blood gushed from his nose and  his mouth, and he was borne senseless from the lists.          The acclamations of thousands applauded the unanimous award of the Prince and  marshals, announcing that day&rsquo;s honours to the Disinherited Knight.                     CHAPTER IX        &mdash;&mdash;In the midst was seen   A lady of a more majestic mien,   By stature and by beauty mark&rsquo;d their sovereign Queen.               And as in beauty she surpass&rsquo;d the choir,   So nobler than the rest was her attire;   A crown of ruddy gold enclosed her brow,   Plain without pomp, and rich without a show;   A branch of Agnus Castus in her hand,   She bore aloft her symbol of command.          T HE  F LOWER AND THE  L EAF           William de Wyvil and Stephen de Martival, the marshals of the field, were the  first to offer their congratulations to the victor, praying him, at the same  time, to suffer his helmet to be unlaced, or, at least, that he would raise his  visor ere they conducted him to receive the prize of the day&rsquo;s tourney  from the hands of Prince John. The Disinherited Knight, with all knightly  courtesy, declined their request, alleging, that he could not at this time  suffer his face to be seen, for reasons which he had assigned to the heralds  when he entered the lists. The marshals were perfectly satisfied by this reply;  for amidst the frequent and capricious vows by which knights were accustomed to  bind themselves in the days of chivalry, there were none more common than those  by which they engaged to remain incognito for a certain space, or until some  particular adventure was achieved. The marshals, therefore, pressed no farther  into the mystery of the Disinherited Knight, but, announcing to Prince John the  conqueror&rsquo;s desire to remain unknown, they requested permission to bring  him before his Grace, in order that he might receive the reward of his valour.          John&rsquo;s curiosity was excited by the mystery observed by the stranger;  and, being already displeased with the issue of the tournament, in which the  challengers whom he favoured had been successively defeated by one knight, he  answered haughtily to the marshals, &ldquo;By the light of Our Lady&rsquo;s  brow, this same knight hath been disinherited as well of his courtesy as of his  lands, since he desires to appear before us without uncovering his  face.&mdash;Wot ye, my lords,&rdquo; he said, turning round to his train,  &ldquo;who this gallant can be, that bears himself thus proudly?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I cannot guess,&rdquo; answered De Bracy, &ldquo;nor did I think there  had been within the four seas that girth Britain a champion that could bear  down these five knights in one day&rsquo;s jousting. By my faith, I shall never  forget the force with which he shocked De Vipont. The poor Hospitaller was  hurled from his saddle like a stone from a sling.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Boast not of that,&rdquo; said a Knight of St John, who was present;  &ldquo;your Temple champion had no better luck. I saw your brave lance,  Bois-Guilbert, roll thrice over, grasping his hands full of sand at every  turn.&rdquo;          De Bracy, being attached to the Templars, would have replied, but was prevented  by Prince John. &ldquo;Silence, sirs!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;what unprofitable  debate have we here?&rdquo;          &ldquo;The victor,&rdquo; said De Wyvil, &ldquo;still waits the pleasure of  your highness.&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is our pleasure,&rdquo; answered John, &ldquo;that he do so wait  until we learn whether there is not some one who can at least guess at his name  and quality. Should he remain there till night-fall, he has had work enough to  keep him warm.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Your Grace,&rdquo; said Waldemar Fitzurse, &ldquo;will do less than due  honour to the victor, if you compel him to wait till we tell your highness that  which we cannot know; at least I can form no guess&mdash;unless he be one of  the good lances who accompanied King Richard to Palestine, and who are now  straggling homeward from the Holy Land.&rdquo;          &ldquo;It may be the Earl of Salisbury,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;he is  about the same pitch.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Sir Thomas de Multon, the Knight of Gilsland, rather,&rdquo; said  Fitzurse; &ldquo;Salisbury is bigger in the bones.&rdquo; A whisper arose among  the train, but by whom first suggested could not be ascertained. &ldquo;It  might be the King&mdash;it might be Richard Cœur-de-Lion himself!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Over God&rsquo;s forbode!&rdquo; said Prince John, involuntarily turning  at the same time as pale as death, and shrinking as if blighted by a flash of  lightning; &ldquo;Waldemar!&mdash;De Bracy! brave knights and gentlemen,  remember your promises, and stand truly by me!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Here is no danger impending,&rdquo; said Waldemar Fitzurse; &ldquo;are  you so little acquainted with the gigantic limbs of your father&rsquo;s son, as  to think they can be held within the circumference of yonder suit of  armour?&mdash;De Wyvil and Martival, you will best serve the Prince by bringing  forward the victor to the throne, and ending an error that has conjured all the  blood from his cheeks.&mdash;Look at him more closely,&rdquo; he continued,  &ldquo;your highness will see that he wants three inches of King  Richard&rsquo;s height, and twice as much of his shoulder-breadth. The very  horse he backs, could not have carried the ponderous weight of King Richard  through a single course.&rdquo;          While he was yet speaking, the marshals brought forward the Disinherited Knight  to the foot of a wooden flight of steps, which formed the ascent from the lists  to Prince John&rsquo;s throne. Still discomposed with the idea that his  brother, so much injured, and to whom he was so much indebted, had suddenly  arrived in his native kingdom, even the distinctions pointed out by Fitzurse  did not altogether remove the Prince&rsquo;s apprehensions; and while, with a  short and embarrassed eulogy upon his valour, he caused to be delivered to him  the war-horse assigned as the prize, he trembled lest from the barred visor of  the mailed form before him, an answer might be returned, in the deep and awful  accents of Richard the Lion-hearted.          But the Disinherited Knight spoke not a word in reply to the compliment of the  Prince, which he only acknowledged with a profound obeisance.          The horse was led into the lists by two grooms richly dressed, the animal  itself being fully accoutred with the richest war-furniture; which, however,  scarcely added to the value of the noble creature in the eyes of those who were  judges. Laying one hand upon the pommel of the saddle, the Disinherited Knight  vaulted at once upon the back of the steed without making use of the stirrup,  and, brandishing aloft his lance, rode twice around the lists, exhibiting the  points and paces of the horse with the skill of a perfect horseman.          The appearance of vanity, which might otherwise have been attributed to this  display, was removed by the propriety shown in exhibiting to the best advantage  the princely reward with which he had been just honoured, and the Knight was  again greeted by the acclamations of all present.          In the meanwhile, the bustling Prior of Jorvaulx had reminded Prince John, in a  whisper, that the victor must now display his good judgment, instead of his  valour, by selecting from among the beauties who graced the galleries a lady,  who should fill the throne of the Queen of Beauty and of Love, and deliver the  prize of the tourney upon the ensuing day. The Prince accordingly made a sign  with his truncheon, as the Knight passed him in his second career around the  lists. The Knight turned towards the throne, and, sinking his lance, until the  point was within a foot of the ground, remained motionless, as if expecting  John&rsquo;s commands; while all admired the sudden dexterity with which he  instantly reduced his fiery steed from a state of violent emotion and high  excitation to the stillness of an equestrian statue.          &ldquo;Sir Disinherited Knight,&rdquo; said Prince John, &ldquo;since that is  the only title by which we can address you, it is now your duty, as well as  privilege, to name the fair lady, who, as Queen of Honour and of Love, is to  preside over next day&rsquo;s festival. If, as a stranger in our land, you  should require the aid of other judgment to guide your own, we can only say  that Alicia, the daughter of our gallant knight Waldemar Fitzurse, has at our  court been long held the first in beauty as in place. Nevertheless, it is your  undoubted prerogative to confer on whom you please this crown, by the delivery  of which to the lady of your choice, the election of to-morrow&rsquo;s Queen  will be formal and complete.&mdash;Raise your lance.&rdquo;          The Knight obeyed; and Prince John placed upon its point a coronet of green  satin, having around its edge a circlet of gold, the upper edge of which was  relieved by arrow-points and hearts placed interchangeably, like the strawberry  leaves and balls upon a ducal crown.          In the broad hint which he dropped respecting the daughter of Waldemar  Fitzurse, John had more than one motive, each the offspring of a mind, which  was a strange mixture of carelessness and presumption with low artifice and  cunning. He wished to banish from the minds of the chivalry around him his own  indecent and unacceptable jest respecting the Jewess Rebecca; he was desirous  of conciliating Alicia&rsquo;s father Waldemar, of whom he stood in awe, and  who had more than once shown himself dissatisfied during the course of the  day&rsquo;s proceedings. He had also a wish to establish himself in the good  graces of the lady; for John was at least as licentious in his pleasures as  profligate in his ambition. But besides all these reasons, he was desirous to  raise up against the Disinherited Knight (towards whom he already entertained a  strong dislike) a powerful enemy in the person of Waldemar Fitzurse, who was  likely, he thought, highly to resent the injury done to his daughter, in case,  as was not unlikely, the victor should make another choice.          And so indeed it proved. For the Disinherited Knight passed the gallery close  to that of the Prince, in which the Lady Alicia was seated in the full pride of  triumphant beauty, and, pacing forwards as slowly as he had hitherto rode  swiftly around the lists, he seemed to exercise his right of examining the  numerous fair faces which adorned that splendid circle.          It was worth while to see the different conduct of the beauties who underwent  this examination, during the time it was proceeding. Some blushed, some assumed  an air of pride and dignity, some looked straight forward, and essayed to seem  utterly unconscious of what was going on, some drew back in alarm, which was  perhaps affected, some endeavoured to forbear smiling, and there were two or  three who laughed outright. There were also some who dropped their veils over  their charms; but, as the Wardour Manuscript says these were fair ones of ten  years standing, it may be supposed that, having had their full share of such  vanities, they were willing to withdraw their claim, in order to give a fair  chance to the rising beauties of the age.          At length the champion paused beneath the balcony in which the Lady Rowena was  placed, and the expectation of the spectators was excited to the utmost.          It must be owned, that if an interest displayed in his success could have  bribed the Disinherited Knight, the part of the lists before which he paused  had merited his predilection. Cedric the Saxon, overjoyed at the discomfiture  of the Templar, and still more so at the miscarriage of his two malevolent  neighbours, Front-de-Bœuf and Malvoisin, had, with his body half stretched  over the balcony, accompanied the victor in each course, not with his eyes  only, but with his whole heart and soul. The Lady Rowena had watched the  progress of the day with equal attention, though without openly betraying the  same intense interest. Even the unmoved Athelstane had shown symptoms of  shaking off his apathy, when, calling for a huge goblet of muscadine, he  quaffed it to the health of the Disinherited Knight. Another group, stationed  under the gallery occupied by the Saxons, had shown no less interest in the  fate of the day.          &ldquo;Father Abraham!&rdquo; said Isaac of York, when the first course was run  betwixt the Templar and the Disinherited Knight, &ldquo;how fiercely that  Gentile rides! Ah, the good horse that was brought all the long way from  Barbary, he takes no more care of him than if he were a wild ass&rsquo;s  colt&mdash;and the noble armour, that was worth so many zecchins to Joseph  Pareira, the armourer of Milan, besides seventy in the hundred of profits, he  cares for it as little as if he had found it in the highways!&rdquo;          &ldquo;If he risks his own person and limbs, father,&rdquo; said Rebecca,  &ldquo;in doing such a dreadful battle, he can scarce be expected to spare his  horse and armour.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Child!&rdquo; replied Isaac, somewhat heated, &ldquo;thou knowest not  what thou speakest&mdash;His neck and limbs are his own, but his horse and  armour belong to&mdash;Holy Jacob! what was I about to say!&mdash;Nevertheless,  it is a good youth&mdash;See, Rebecca! see, he is again about to go up to  battle against the Philistine&mdash;Pray, child&mdash;pray for the safety of  the good youth,&mdash;and of the speedy horse, and the rich armour.&mdash;God  of my fathers!&rdquo; he again exclaimed, &ldquo;he hath conquered, and the  uncircumcised Philistine hath fallen before his lance,&mdash;even as Og the  King of Bashan, and Sihon, King of the Amorites, fell before the sword of our  fathers!&mdash;Surely he shall take their gold and their silver, and their  war-horses, and their armour of brass and of steel, for a prey and for a  spoil.&rdquo;          The same anxiety did the worthy Jew display during every course that was run,  seldom failing to hazard a hasty calculation concerning the value of the horse  and armour which was forfeited to the champion upon each new success. There had  been therefore no small interest taken in the success of the Disinherited  Knight, by those who occupied the part of the lists before which he now paused.          Whether from indecision, or some other motive of hesitation, the champion of  the day remained stationary for more than a minute, while the eyes of the  silent audience were riveted upon his motions; and then, gradually and  gracefully sinking the point of his lance, he deposited the coronet which it  supported at the feet of the fair Rowena. The trumpets instantly sounded, while  the heralds proclaimed the Lady Rowena the Queen of Beauty and of Love for the  ensuing day, menacing with suitable penalties those who should be disobedient  to her authority. They then repeated their cry of Largesse, to which Cedric, in  the height of his joy, replied by an ample donative, and to which Athelstane,  though less promptly, added one equally large.          There was some murmuring among the damsels of Norman descent, who were as much  unused to see the preference given to a Saxon beauty, as the Norman nobles were  to sustain defeat in the games of chivalry which they themselves had  introduced. But these sounds of disaffection were drowned by the popular shout  of &ldquo;Long live the Lady Rowena, the chosen and lawful Queen of Love and of  Beauty!&rdquo; To which many in the lower area added, &ldquo;Long live the  Saxon Princess! long live the race of the immortal Alfred!&rdquo;          However unacceptable these sounds might be to Prince John, and to those around  him, he saw himself nevertheless obliged to confirm the nomination of the  victor, and accordingly calling to horse, he left his throne; and mounting his  jennet, accompanied by his train, he again entered the lists. The Prince paused  a moment beneath the gallery of the Lady Alicia, to whom he paid his  compliments, observing, at the same time, to those around him&mdash;&ldquo;By  my halidome, sirs! if the Knight&rsquo;s feats in arms have shown that he hath  limbs and sinews, his choice hath no less proved that his eyes are none of the  clearest.&rdquo;          It was on this occasion, as during his whole life, John&rsquo;s misfortune, not  perfectly to understand the characters of those whom he wished to conciliate.  Waldemar Fitzurse was rather offended than pleased at the Prince stating thus  broadly an opinion, that his daughter had been slighted.          &ldquo;I know no right of chivalry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;more precious or  inalienable than that of each free knight to choose his lady-love by his own  judgment. My daughter courts distinction from no one; and in her own character,  and in her own sphere, will never fail to receive the full proportion of that  which is her due.&rdquo;          Prince John replied not; but, spurring his horse, as if to give vent to his  vexation, he made the animal bound forward to the gallery where Rowena was  seated, with the crown still at her feet.          &ldquo;Assume,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;fair lady, the mark of your sovereignty,  to which none vows homage more sincerely than ourself, John of Anjou; and if it  please you to-day, with your noble sire and friends, to grace our banquet in  the Castle of Ashby, we shall learn to know the empress to whose service we  devote to-morrow.&rdquo;          Rowena remained silent, and Cedric answered for her in his native Saxon.          &ldquo;The Lady Rowena,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;possesses not the language in  which to reply to your courtesy, or to sustain her part in your festival. I  also, and the noble Athelstane of Coningsburgh, speak only the language, and  practise only the manners, of our fathers. We therefore decline with thanks  your Highness&rsquo;s courteous invitation to the banquet. To-morrow, the Lady  Rowena will take upon her the state to which she has been called by the free  election of the victor Knight, confirmed by the acclamations of the  people.&rdquo;          So saying, he lifted the coronet, and placed it upon Rowena&rsquo;s head, in  token of her acceptance of the temporary authority assigned to her.          &ldquo;What says he?&rdquo; said Prince John, affecting not to understand the  Saxon language, in which, however, he was well skilled. The purport of  Cedric&rsquo;s speech was repeated to him in French. &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo;  he said; &ldquo;to-morrow we will ourself conduct this mute sovereign to her  seat of dignity.&mdash;You, at least, Sir Knight,&rdquo; he added, turning to  the victor, who had remained near the gallery, &ldquo;will this day share our  banquet?&rdquo;          The Knight, speaking for the first time, in a low and hurried voice, excused  himself by pleading fatigue, and the necessity of preparing for  to-morrow&rsquo;s encounter.          &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said Prince John, haughtily; &ldquo;although unused  to such refusals, we will endeavour to digest our banquet as we may, though  ungraced by the most successful in arms, and his elected Queen of  Beauty.&rdquo;          So saying, he prepared to leave the lists with his glittering train, and his  turning his steed for that purpose, was the signal for the breaking up and  dispersion of the spectators.          Yet, with the vindictive memory proper to offended pride, especially when  combined with conscious want of desert, John had hardly proceeded three paces,  ere again, turning around, he fixed an eye of stern resentment upon the yeoman  who had displeased him in the early part of the day, and issued his commands to  the men-at-arms who stood near&mdash;&ldquo;On your life, suffer not that  fellow to escape.&rdquo;          The yeoman stood the angry glance of the Prince with the same unvaried  steadiness which had marked his former deportment, saying, with a smile,  &ldquo;I have no intention to leave Ashby until the day after to-morrow&mdash;I  must see how Staffordshire and Leicestershire can draw their bows&mdash;the  forests of Needwood and Charnwood must rear good archers.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I,&rdquo; said Prince John to his attendants, but not in direct  reply,&mdash;&ldquo;I will see how he can draw his own; and woe betide him  unless his skill should prove some apology for his insolence!&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is full time,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;that the  &lsquo;outrecuidance&rsquo;   19   of these peasants should be  restrained by some striking example.&rdquo;          Waldemar Fitzurse, who probably thought his patron was not taking the readiest  road to popularity, shrugged up his shoulders and was silent. Prince John  resumed his retreat from the lists, and the dispersion of the multitude became  general.          In various routes, according to the different quarters from which they came,  and in groups of various numbers, the spectators were seen retiring over the  plain. By far the most numerous part streamed towards the town of Ashby, where  many of the distinguished persons were lodged in the castle, and where others  found accommodation in the town itself. Among these were most of the knights  who had already appeared in the tournament, or who proposed to fight there the  ensuing day, and who, as they rode slowly along, talking over the events of the  day, were greeted with loud shouts by the populace. The same acclamations were  bestowed upon Prince John, although he was indebted for them rather to the  splendour of his appearance and train, than to the popularity of his character.          A more sincere and more general, as well as a better-merited acclamation,  attended the victor of the day, until, anxious to withdraw himself from popular  notice, he accepted the accommodation of one of those pavilions pitched at the  extremities of the lists, the use of which was courteously tendered him by the  marshals of the field. On his retiring to his tent, many who had lingered in  the lists, to look upon and form conjectures concerning him, also dispersed.          The signs and sounds of a tumultuous concourse of men lately crowded together  in one place, and agitated by the same passing events, were now exchanged for  the distant hum of voices of different groups retreating in all directions, and  these speedily died away in silence. No other sounds were heard save the voices  of the menials who stripped the galleries of their cushions and tapestry, in  order to put them in safety for the night, and wrangled among themselves for  the half-used bottles of wine and relics of the refreshment which had been  served round to the spectators.          Beyond the precincts of the lists more than one forge was erected; and these  now began to glimmer through the twilight, announcing the toil of the  armourers, which was to continue through the whole night, in order to repair or  alter the suits of armour to be used again on the morrow.          A strong guard of men-at-arms, renewed at intervals, from two hours to two  hours, surrounded the lists, and kept watch during the night.                     CHAPTER X        Thus, like the sad presaging raven, that tolls   The sick man&rsquo;s passport in her hollow beak,   And in the shadow of the silent night   Doth shake contagion from her sable wings;   Vex&rsquo;d and tormented, runs poor Barrabas,   With fatal curses towards these Christians.          J EW OF  M ALTA           The Disinherited Knight had no sooner reached his pavilion, than squires and  pages in abundance tendered their services to disarm him, to bring fresh  attire, and to offer him the refreshment of the bath. Their zeal on this  occasion was perhaps sharpened by curiosity, since every one desired to know  who the knight was that had gained so many laurels, yet had refused, even at  the command of Prince John, to lift his visor or to name his name. But their  officious inquisitiveness was not gratified. The Disinherited Knight refused  all other assistance save that of his own squire, or rather yeoman&mdash;a  clownish-looking man, who, wrapt in a cloak of dark-coloured felt, and having  his head and face half-buried in a Norman bonnet made of black fur, seemed to  affect the incognito as much as his master. All others being excluded from the  tent, this attendant relieved his master from the more burdensome parts of his  armour, and placed food and wine before him, which the exertions of the day  rendered very acceptable.          The Knight had scarcely finished a hasty meal, ere his menial announced to him  that five men, each leading a barbed steed, desired to speak with him. The  Disinherited Knight had exchanged his armour for the long robe usually worn by  those of his condition, which, being furnished with a hood, concealed the  features, when such was the pleasure of the wearer, almost as completely as the  visor of the helmet itself, but the twilight, which was now fast darkening,  would of itself have rendered a disguise unnecessary, unless to persons to whom  the face of an individual chanced to be particularly well known.          The Disinherited Knight, therefore, stept boldly forth to the front of his  tent, and found in attendance the squires of the challengers, whom he easily  knew by their russet and black dresses, each of whom led his master&rsquo;s  charger, loaded with the armour in which he had that day fought.          &ldquo;According to the laws of chivalry,&rdquo; said the foremost of these  men, &ldquo;I, Baldwin de Oyley, squire to the redoubted Knight Brian de  Bois-Guilbert, make offer to you, styling yourself, for the present, the  Disinherited Knight, of the horse and armour used by the said Brian de  Bois-Guilbert in this day&rsquo;s Passage of Arms, leaving it with your  nobleness to retain or to ransom the same, according to your pleasure; for such  is the law of arms.&rdquo;          The other squires repeated nearly the same formula, and then stood to await the  decision of the Disinherited Knight.          &ldquo;To you four, sirs,&rdquo; replied the Knight, addressing those who had  last spoken, &ldquo;and to your honourable and valiant masters, I have one  common reply. Commend me to the noble knights, your masters, and say, I should  do ill to deprive them of steeds and arms which can never be used by braver  cavaliers.&mdash;I would I could here end my message to these gallant knights;  but being, as I term myself, in truth and earnest, the Disinherited, I must be  thus far bound to your masters, that they will, of their courtesy, be pleased  to ransom their steeds and armour, since that which I wear I can hardly term  mine own.&rdquo;          &ldquo;We stand commissioned, each of us,&rdquo; answered the squire of  Reginald Front-de-Bœuf, &ldquo;to offer a hundred zecchins in ransom of these  horses and suits of armour.&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is sufficient,&rdquo; said the Disinherited Knight. &ldquo;Half the  sum my present necessities compel me to accept; of the remaining half,  distribute one moiety among yourselves, sir squires, and divide the other half  betwixt the heralds and the pursuivants, and minstrels, and attendants.&rdquo;          The squires, with cap in hand, and low reverences, expressed their deep sense  of a courtesy and generosity not often practised, at least upon a scale so  extensive. The Disinherited Knight then addressed his discourse to Baldwin, the  squire of Brian de Bois-Guilbert. &ldquo;From your master,&rdquo; said he,  &ldquo;I will accept neither arms nor ransom. Say to him in my name, that our  strife is not ended&mdash;no, not till we have fought as well with swords as  with lances&mdash;as well on foot as on horseback. To this mortal quarrel he  has himself defied me, and I shall not forget the challenge.&mdash;Meantime,  let him be assured, that I hold him not as one of his companions, with whom I  can with pleasure exchange courtesies; but rather as one with whom I stand upon  terms of mortal defiance.&rdquo;          &ldquo;My master,&rdquo; answered Baldwin, &ldquo;knows how to requite scorn  with scorn, and blows with blows, as well as courtesy with courtesy. Since you  disdain to accept from him any share of the ransom at which you have rated the  arms of the other knights, I must leave his armour and his horse here, being  well assured that he will never deign to mount the one nor wear the  other.&rdquo;          &ldquo;You have spoken well, good squire,&rdquo; said the Disinherited Knight,  &ldquo;well and boldly, as it beseemeth him to speak who answers for an absent  master. Leave not, however, the horse and armour here. Restore them to thy  master; or, if he scorns to accept them, retain them, good friend, for thine  own use. So far as they are mine, I bestow them upon you freely.&rdquo;          Baldwin made a deep obeisance, and retired with his companions; and the  Disinherited Knight entered the pavilion.          &ldquo;Thus far, Gurth,&rdquo; said he, addressing his attendant, &ldquo;the  reputation of English chivalry hath not suffered in my hands.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Gurth, &ldquo;for a Saxon swineherd, have not ill  played the personage of a Norman squire-at-arms.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Yea, but,&rdquo; answered the Disinherited Knight, &ldquo;thou hast ever  kept me in anxiety lest thy clownish bearing should discover thee.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Tush!&rdquo; said Gurth, &ldquo;I fear discovery from none, saving my  playfellow, Wamba the Jester, of whom I could never discover whether he were  most knave or fool. Yet I could scarce choose but laugh, when my old master  passed so near to me, dreaming all the while that Gurth was keeping his porkers  many a mile off, in the thickets and swamps of Rotherwood. If I am  discovered&mdash;-&rdquo;          &ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; said the Disinherited Knight, &ldquo;thou knowest my  promise.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay, for that matter,&rdquo; said Gurth, &ldquo;I will never fail my  friend for fear of my skin-cutting. I have a tough hide, that will bear knife  or scourge as well as any boar&rsquo;s hide in my herd.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Trust me, I will requite the risk you run for my love, Gurth,&rdquo;  said the Knight. &ldquo;Meanwhile, I pray you to accept these ten pieces of  gold.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I am richer,&rdquo; said Gurth, putting them into his pouch, &ldquo;than  ever was swineherd or bondsman.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Take this bag of gold to Ashby,&rdquo; continued his master, &ldquo;and  find out Isaac the Jew of York, and let him pay himself for the horse and arms  with which his credit supplied me.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay, by St Dunstan,&rdquo; replied Gurth, &ldquo;that I will not  do.&rdquo;          &ldquo;How, knave,&rdquo; replied his master, &ldquo;wilt thou not obey my  commands?&rdquo;          &ldquo;So they be honest, reasonable, and Christian commands,&rdquo; replied  Gurth; &ldquo;but this is none of these. To suffer the Jew to pay himself would  be dishonest, for it would be cheating my master; and unreasonable, for it were  the part of a fool; and unchristian, since it would be plundering a believer to  enrich an infidel.&rdquo;          &ldquo;See him contented, however, thou stubborn varlet,&rdquo; said the  Disinherited Knight.          &ldquo;I will do so,&rdquo; said Gurth, taking the bag under his cloak, and  leaving the apartment; &ldquo;and it will go hard,&rdquo; he muttered,  &ldquo;but I content him with one-half of his own asking.&rdquo; So saying, he  departed, and left the Disinherited Knight to his own perplexed ruminations;  which, upon more accounts than it is now possible to communicate to the reader,  were of a nature peculiarly agitating and painful.          We must now change the scene to the village of Ashby, or rather to a country  house in its vicinity belonging to a wealthy Israelite, with whom Isaac, his  daughter, and retinue, had taken up their quarters; the Jews, it is well known,  being as liberal in exercising the duties of hospitality and charity among  their own people, as they were alleged to be reluctant and churlish in  extending them to those whom they termed Gentiles, and whose treatment of them  certainly merited little hospitality at their hand.          In an apartment, small indeed, but richly furnished with decorations of an  Oriental taste, Rebecca was seated on a heap of embroidered cushions, which,  piled along a low platform that surrounded the chamber, served, like the  estrada of the Spaniards, instead of chairs and stools. She was watching the  motions of her father with a look of anxious and filial affection, while he  paced the apartment with a dejected mien and disordered step; sometimes  clasping his hands together&mdash;sometimes casting his eyes to the roof of the  apartment, as one who laboured under great mental tribulation. &ldquo;O,  Jacob!&rdquo; he exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;O, all ye twelve Holy Fathers of our  tribe! what a losing venture is this for one who hath duly kept every jot and  tittle of the law of Moses&mdash;Fifty zecchins wrenched from me at one clutch,  and by the talons of a tyrant!&rdquo;          &ldquo;But, father,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;you seemed to give the gold to  Prince John willingly.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Willingly? the blotch of Egypt upon him!&mdash;Willingly, saidst  thou?&mdash;Ay, as willingly as when, in the Gulf of Lyons, I flung over my  merchandise to lighten the ship, while she laboured in the tempest&mdash;robed  the seething billows in my choice silks&mdash;perfumed their briny foam with  myrrh and aloes&mdash;enriched their caverns with gold and silver work! And was  not that an hour of unutterable misery, though my own hands made the  sacrifice?&rdquo;          &ldquo;But it was a sacrifice which Heaven exacted to save our lives,&rdquo;  answered Rebecca, &ldquo;and the God of our fathers has since blessed your  store and your gettings.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; answered Isaac, &ldquo;but if the tyrant lays hold on them as  he did to-day, and compels me to smile while he is robbing me?&mdash;O,  daughter, disinherited and wandering as we are, the worst evil which befalls  our race is, that when we are wronged and plundered, all the world laughs  around, and we are compelled to suppress our sense of injury, and to smile  tamely, when we would revenge bravely.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Think not thus of it, my father,&rdquo; said Rebecca; &ldquo;we also  have advantages. These Gentiles, cruel and oppressive as they are, are in some  sort dependent on the dispersed children of Zion, whom they despise and  persecute. Without the aid of our wealth, they could neither furnish forth  their hosts in war, nor their triumphs in peace, and the gold which we lend  them returns with increase to our coffers. We are like the herb which  flourisheth most when it is most trampled on. Even this day&rsquo;s pageant had  not proceeded without the consent of the despised Jew, who furnished the  means.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Daughter,&rdquo; said Isaac, &ldquo;thou hast harped upon another string  of sorrow. The goodly steed and the rich armour, equal to the full profit of my  adventure with our Kirjath Jairam of Leicester&mdash;there is a dead loss  too&mdash;ay, a loss which swallows up the gains of a week; ay, of the space  between two Sabbaths&mdash;and yet it may end better than I now think, for  &rsquo;tis a good youth.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Assuredly,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;you shall not repent you of  requiting the good deed received of the stranger knight.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I trust so, daughter,&rdquo; said Isaac, &ldquo;and I trust too in the  rebuilding of Zion; but as well do I hope with my own bodily eyes to see the  walls and battlements of the new Temple, as to see a Christian, yea, the very  best of Christians, repay a debt to a Jew, unless under the awe of the judge  and jailor.&rdquo;          So saying, he resumed his discontented walk through the apartment; and Rebecca,  perceiving that her attempts at consolation only served to awaken new subjects  of complaint, wisely desisted from her unavailing efforts&mdash;a prudential  line of conduct, and we recommend to all who set up for comforters and  advisers, to follow it in the like circumstances.          The evening was now becoming dark, when a Jewish servant entered the apartment,  and placed upon the table two silver lamps, fed with perfumed oil; the richest  wines, and the most delicate refreshments, were at the same time displayed by  another Israelitish domestic on a small ebony table, inlaid with silver; for,  in the interior of their houses, the Jews refused themselves no expensive  indulgences. At the same time the servant informed Isaac, that a Nazarene (so  they termed Christians, while conversing among themselves) desired to speak  with him. He that would live by traffic, must hold himself at the disposal of  every one claiming business with him. Isaac at once replaced on the table the  untasted glass of Greek wine which he had just raised to his lips, and saying  hastily to his daughter, &ldquo;Rebecca, veil thyself,&rdquo; commanded the  stranger to be admitted.          Just as Rebecca had dropped over her fine features a screen of silver gauze  which reached to her feet, the door opened, and Gurth entered, wrapt in the  ample folds of his Norman mantle. His appearance was rather suspicious than  prepossessing, especially as, instead of doffing his bonnet, he pulled it still  deeper over his rugged brow.          &ldquo;Art thou Isaac the Jew of York?&rdquo; said Gurth, in Saxon.          &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; replied Isaac, in the same language, (for his traffic had  rendered every tongue spoken in Britain familiar to him)&mdash;&ldquo;and who  art thou?&rdquo;          &ldquo;That is not to the purpose,&rdquo; answered Gurth.          &ldquo;As much as my name is to thee,&rdquo; replied Isaac; &ldquo;for without  knowing thine, how can I hold intercourse with thee?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Easily,&rdquo; answered Gurth; &ldquo;I, being to pay money, must know  that I deliver it to the right person; thou, who are to receive it, will not, I  think, care very greatly by whose hands it is delivered.&rdquo;          &ldquo;O,&rdquo; said the Jew, &ldquo;you are come to pay moneys?&mdash;Holy  Father Abraham! that altereth our relation to each other. And from whom dost  thou bring it?&rdquo;          &ldquo;From the Disinherited Knight,&rdquo; said Gurth, &ldquo;victor in this  day&rsquo;s tournament. It is the price of the armour supplied to him by  Kirjath Jairam of Leicester, on thy recommendation. The steed is restored to  thy stable. I desire to know the amount of the sum which I am to pay for the  armour.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I said he was a good youth!&rdquo; exclaimed Isaac with joyful  exultation. &ldquo;A cup of wine will do thee no harm,&rdquo; he added, filling  and handing to the swineherd a richer drought than Gurth had ever before  tasted. &ldquo;And how much money,&rdquo; continued Isaac, &ldquo;has thou  brought with thee?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Holy Virgin!&rdquo; said Gurth, setting down the cup, &ldquo;what nectar  these unbelieving dogs drink, while true Christians are fain to quaff ale as  muddy and thick as the draff we give to hogs!&mdash;What money have I brought  with me?&rdquo; continued the Saxon, when he had finished this uncivil  ejaculation, &ldquo;even but a small sum; something in hand the whilst. What,  Isaac! thou must bear a conscience, though it be a Jewish one.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay, but,&rdquo; said Isaac, &ldquo;thy master has won goodly steeds and  rich armours with the strength of his lance, and of his right hand&mdash;but  &rsquo;tis a good youth&mdash;the Jew will take these in present payment, and  render him back the surplus.&rdquo;          &ldquo;My master has disposed of them already,&rdquo; said Gurth.          &ldquo;Ah! that was wrong,&rdquo; said the Jew, &ldquo;that was the part of a  fool. No Christians here could buy so many horses and armour&mdash;no Jew  except myself would give him half the values. But thou hast a hundred zecchins  with thee in that bag,&rdquo; said Isaac, prying under Gurth&rsquo;s cloak,  &ldquo;it is a heavy one.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I have heads for cross-bow bolts in it,&rdquo; said Gurth, readily.          &ldquo;Well, then&rdquo;&mdash;said Isaac, panting and hesitating between  habitual love of gain and a new-born desire to be liberal in the present  instance, &ldquo;if I should say that I would take eighty zecchins for the good  steed and the rich armour, which leaves me not a guilder&rsquo;s profit, have  you money to pay me?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Barely,&rdquo; said Gurth, though the sum demanded was more reasonable  than he expected, &ldquo;and it will leave my master nigh penniless.  Nevertheless, if such be your least offer, I must be content.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Fill thyself another goblet of wine,&rdquo; said the Jew. &ldquo;Ah!  eighty zecchins is too little. It leaveth no profit for the usages of the  moneys; and, besides, the good horse may have suffered wrong in this  day&rsquo;s encounter. O, it was a hard and a dangerous meeting! man and steed  rushing on each other like wild bulls of Bashan! The horse cannot but have had  wrong.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And I say,&rdquo; replied Gurth, &ldquo;he is sound, wind and limb; and  you may see him now, in your stable. And I say, over and above, that seventy  zecchins is enough for the armour, and I hope a Christian&rsquo;s word is as  good as a Jew&rsquo;s. If you will not take seventy, I will carry this  bag&rdquo; (and he shook it till the contents jingled) &ldquo;back to my  master.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay, nay!&rdquo; said Isaac; &ldquo;lay down the talents&mdash;the  shekels&mdash;the eighty zecchins, and thou shalt see I will consider thee  liberally.&rdquo;          Gurth at length complied; and telling out eighty zecchins upon the table, the  Jew delivered out to him an acquittance for the horse and suit of armour. The  Jew&rsquo;s hand trembled for joy as he wrapped up the first seventy pieces of  gold. The last ten he told over with much deliberation, pausing, and saying  something as he took each piece from the table, and dropt it into his purse. It  seemed as if his avarice were struggling with his better nature, and compelling  him to pouch zecchin after zecchin while his generosity urged him to restore  some part at least to his benefactor, or as a donation to his agent. His whole  speech ran nearly thus:          &ldquo;Seventy-one&mdash;seventy-two; thy master is a good  youth&mdash;seventy-three, an excellent youth&mdash;seventy-four&mdash;that  piece hath been clipt within the ring&mdash;seventy-five&mdash;and that looketh  light of weight&mdash;seventy-six&mdash;when thy master wants money, let him  come to Isaac of York&mdash;seventy-seven&mdash;that is, with reasonable  security.&rdquo; Here he made a considerable pause, and Gurth had good hope  that the last three pieces might escape the fate of their comrades; but the  enumeration proceeded.&mdash;&ldquo;Seventy-eight&mdash;thou art a good  fellow&mdash;seventy-nine&mdash;and deservest something for  thyself&mdash;-&rdquo;          Here the Jew paused again, and looked at the last zecchin, intending,  doubtless, to bestow it upon Gurth. He weighed it upon the tip of his finger,  and made it ring by dropping it upon the table. Had it rung too flat, or had it  felt a hair&rsquo;s breadth too light, generosity had carried the day; but,  unhappily for Gurth, the chime was full and true, the zecchin plump, newly  coined, and a grain above weight. Isaac could not find in his heart to part  with it, so dropt it into his purse as if in absence of mind, with the words,  &ldquo;Eighty completes the tale, and I trust thy master will reward thee  handsomely.&mdash;Surely,&rdquo; he added, looking earnestly at the bag,  &ldquo;thou hast more coins in that pouch?&rdquo;          Gurth grinned, which was his nearest approach to a laugh, as he replied,  &ldquo;About the same quantity which thou hast just told over so  carefully.&rdquo; He then folded the quittance, and put it under his cap,  adding,&mdash;&ldquo;Peril of thy beard, Jew, see that this be full and  ample!&rdquo; He filled himself unbidden, a third goblet of wine, and left the  apartment without ceremony.          &ldquo;Rebecca,&rdquo; said the Jew, &ldquo;that Ishmaelite hath gone somewhat  beyond me. Nevertheless his master is a good youth&mdash;ay, and I am well  pleased that he hath gained shekels of gold and shekels of silver, even by the  speed of his horse and by the strength of his lance, which, like that of  Goliath the Philistine, might vie with a weaver&rsquo;s beam.&rdquo;          As he turned to receive Rebecca&rsquo;s answer, he observed, that during his  chattering with Gurth, she had left the apartment unperceived.          In the meanwhile, Gurth had descended the stair, and, having reached the dark  antechamber or hall, was puzzling about to discover the entrance, when a figure  in white, shown by a small silver lamp which she held in her hand, beckoned him  into a side apartment. Gurth had some reluctance to obey the summons. Rough and  impetuous as a wild boar, where only earthly force was to be apprehended, he  had all the characteristic terrors of a Saxon respecting fawns, forest-fiends,  white women, and the whole of the superstitions which his ancestors had brought  with them from the wilds of Germany. He remembered, moreover, that he was in  the house of a Jew, a people who, besides the other unamiable qualities which  popular report ascribed to them, were supposed to be profound necromancers and  cabalists. Nevertheless, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, he obeyed the beckoning  summons of the apparition, and followed her into the apartment which she  indicated, where he found to his joyful surprise that his fair guide was the  beautiful Jewess whom he had seen at the tournament, and a short time in her  father&rsquo;s apartment.          She asked him the particulars of his transaction with Isaac, which he detailed  accurately.          &ldquo;My father did but jest with thee, good fellow,&rdquo; said Rebecca;  &ldquo;he owes thy master deeper kindness than these arms and steed could pay,  were their value tenfold. What sum didst thou pay my father even now?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Eighty zecchins,&rdquo; said Gurth, surprised at the question.          &ldquo;In this purse,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;thou wilt find a hundred.  Restore to thy master that which is his due, and enrich thyself with the  remainder. Haste&mdash;begone&mdash;stay not to render thanks! and beware how  you pass through this crowded town, where thou mayst easily lose both thy  burden and thy life.&mdash;Reuben,&rdquo; she added, clapping her hands  together, &ldquo;light forth this stranger, and fail not to draw lock and bar  behind him.&rdquo; Reuben, a dark-brow&rsquo;d and black-bearded Israelite,  obeyed her summons, with a torch in his hand; undid the outward door of the  house, and conducting Gurth across a paved court, let him out through a wicket  in the entrance-gate, which he closed behind him with such bolts and chains as  would well have become that of a prison.          &ldquo;By St Dunstan,&rdquo; said Gurth, as he stumbled up the dark avenue,  &ldquo;this is no Jewess, but an angel from heaven! Ten zecchins from my brave  young master&mdash;twenty from this pearl of Zion&mdash;Oh, happy  day!&mdash;Such another, Gurth, will redeem thy bondage, and make thee a  brother as free of thy guild as the best. And then do I lay down my  swineherd&rsquo;s horn and staff, and take the freeman&rsquo;s sword and  buckler, and follow my young master to the death, without hiding either my face  or my name.&rdquo;                     CHAPTER XI        1st Outlaw: Stand, sir, and throw us that you have about you;   If not, we&rsquo;ll make you sit, and rifle you.   Speed: Sir, we are undone! these are the villains   That all the travellers do fear so much.   Val: My friends,&mdash;   1st Out: That&rsquo;s not so, sir, we are your enemies.   2d Out: Peace! we&rsquo;ll hear him.   3d Out: Ay, by my beard, will we;   For he&rsquo;s a proper man.          T WO  G ENTLEMEN OF  V ERONA           The nocturnal adventures of Gurth were not yet concluded; indeed he himself  became partly of that mind, when, after passing one or two straggling houses  which stood in the outskirts of the village, he found himself in a deep lane,  running between two banks overgrown with hazel and holly, while here and there  a dwarf oak flung its arms altogether across the path. The lane was moreover  much rutted and broken up by the carriages which had recently transported  articles of various kinds to the tournament; and it was dark, for the banks and  bushes intercepted the light of the harvest moon.          From the village were heard the distant sounds of revelry, mixed occasionally  with loud laughter, sometimes broken by screams, and sometimes by wild strains  of distant music. All these sounds, intimating the disorderly state of the  town, crowded with military nobles and their dissolute attendants, gave Gurth  some uneasiness. &ldquo;The Jewess was right,&rdquo; he said to himself.  &ldquo;By heaven and St Dunstan, I would I were safe at my journey&rsquo;s end  with all this treasure! Here are such numbers, I will not say of arrant  thieves, but of errant knights and errant squires, errant monks and errant  minstrels, errant jugglers and errant jesters, that a man with a single merk  would be in danger, much more a poor swineherd with a whole bagful of zecchins.  Would I were out of the shade of these infernal bushes, that I might at least  see any of St Nicholas&rsquo;s clerks before they spring on my  shoulders.&rdquo;          Gurth accordingly hastened his pace, in order to gain the open common to which  the lane led, but was not so fortunate as to accomplish his object. Just as he  had attained the upper end of the lane, where the underwood was thickest, four  men sprung upon him, even as his fears anticipated, two from each side of the  road, and seized him so fast, that resistance, if at first practicable, would  have been now too late.&mdash;&ldquo;Surrender your charge,&rdquo; said one of  them; &ldquo;we are the deliverers of the commonwealth, who ease every man of  his burden.&rdquo;          &ldquo;You should not ease me of mine so lightly,&rdquo; muttered Gurth, whose  surly honesty could not be tamed even by the pressure of immediate  violence,&mdash;&ldquo;had I it but in my power to give three strokes in its  defence.&rdquo;          &ldquo;We shall see that presently,&rdquo; said the robber; and, speaking to  his companions, he added, &ldquo;bring along the knave. I see he would have his  head broken, as well as his purse cut, and so be let blood in two veins at  once.&rdquo;          Gurth was hurried along agreeably to this mandate, and having been dragged  somewhat roughly over the bank, on the left-hand side of the lane, found  himself in a straggling thicket, which lay betwixt it and the open common. He  was compelled to follow his rough conductors into the very depth of this cover,  where they stopt unexpectedly in an irregular open space, free in a great  measure from trees, and on which, therefore, the beams of the moon fell without  much interruption from boughs and leaves. Here his captors were joined by two  other persons, apparently belonging to the gang. They had short swords by their  sides, and quarter-staves in their hands, and Gurth could now observe that all  six wore visors, which rendered their occupation a matter of no question, even  had their former proceedings left it in doubt.          &ldquo;What money hast thou, churl?&rdquo; said one of the thieves.          &ldquo;Thirty zecchins of my own property,&rdquo; answered Gurth, doggedly.          &ldquo;A forfeit&mdash;a forfeit,&rdquo; shouted the robbers; &ldquo;a Saxon  hath thirty zecchins, and returns sober from a village! An undeniable and  unredeemable forfeit of all he hath about him.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I hoarded it to purchase my freedom,&rdquo; said Gurth.          &ldquo;Thou art an ass,&rdquo; replied one of the thieves &ldquo;three quarts  of double ale had rendered thee as free as thy master, ay, and freer too, if he  be a Saxon like thyself.&rdquo;          &ldquo;A sad truth,&rdquo; replied Gurth; &ldquo;but if these same thirty  zecchins will buy my freedom from you, unloose my hands, and I will pay them to  you.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Hold,&rdquo; said one who seemed to exercise some authority over the  others; &ldquo;this bag which thou bearest, as I can feel through thy cloak,  contains more coin than thou hast told us of.&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is the good knight my master&rsquo;s,&rdquo; answered Gurth,  &ldquo;of which, assuredly, I would not have spoken a word, had you been  satisfied with working your will upon mine own property.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou art an honest fellow,&rdquo; replied the robber, &ldquo;I warrant  thee; and we worship not St Nicholas so devoutly but what thy thirty zecchins  may yet escape, if thou deal uprightly with us. Meantime render up thy trust  for a time.&rdquo; So saying, he took from Gurth&rsquo;s breast the large  leathern pouch, in which the purse given him by Rebecca was enclosed, as well  as the rest of the zecchins, and then continued his  interrogation.&mdash;&ldquo;Who is thy master?&rdquo;          &ldquo;The Disinherited Knight,&rdquo; said Gurth.          &ldquo;Whose good lance,&rdquo; replied the robber, &ldquo;won the prize in  to-day&rsquo;s tourney? What is his name and lineage?&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is his pleasure,&rdquo; answered Gurth, &ldquo;that they be  concealed; and from me, assuredly, you will learn nought of them.&rdquo;          &ldquo;What is thine own name and lineage?&rdquo;          &ldquo;To tell that,&rdquo; said Gurth, &ldquo;might reveal my  master&rsquo;s.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou art a saucy groom,&rdquo; said the robber, &ldquo;but of that anon.  How comes thy master by this gold? is it of his inheritance, or by what means  hath it accrued to him?&rdquo;          &ldquo;By his good lance,&rdquo; answered Gurth.&mdash;&ldquo;These bags  contain the ransom of four good horses, and four good suits of armour.&rdquo;          &ldquo;How much is there?&rdquo; demanded the robber.          &ldquo;Two hundred zecchins.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Only two hundred zecchins!&rdquo; said the bandit; &ldquo;your master  hath dealt liberally by the vanquished, and put them to a cheap ransom. Name  those who paid the gold.&rdquo;          Gurth did so.          &ldquo;The armour and horse of the Templar Brian de Bois-Guilbert, at what  ransom were they held?&mdash;Thou seest thou canst not deceive me.&rdquo;          &ldquo;My master,&rdquo; replied Gurth, &ldquo;will take nought from the  Templar save his life&rsquo;s-blood. They are on terms of mortal defiance, and  cannot hold courteous intercourse together.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;&mdash;repeated the robber, and paused after he had said  the word. &ldquo;And what wert thou now doing at Ashby with such a charge in  thy custody?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I went thither to render to Isaac the Jew of York,&rdquo; replied Gurth,  &ldquo;the price of a suit of armour with which he fitted my master for this  tournament.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And how much didst thou pay to Isaac?&mdash;Methinks, to judge by  weight, there is still two hundred zecchins in this pouch.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I paid to Isaac,&rdquo; said the Saxon, &ldquo;eighty zecchins, and he  restored me a hundred in lieu thereof.&rdquo;          &ldquo;How! what!&rdquo; exclaimed all the robbers at once; &ldquo;darest thou  trifle with us, that thou tellest such improbable lies?&rdquo;          &ldquo;What I tell you,&rdquo; said Gurth, &ldquo;is as true as the moon is in  heaven. You will find the just sum in a silken purse within the leathern pouch,  and separate from the rest of the gold.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Bethink thee, man,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;thou speakest of a  Jew&mdash;of an Israelite,&mdash;as unapt to restore gold, as the dry sand of  his deserts to return the cup of water which the pilgrim spills upon  them.&rdquo;          &ldquo;There is no more mercy in them,&rdquo; said another of the banditti,  &ldquo;than in an unbribed sheriffs officer.&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is, however, as I say,&rdquo; said Gurth.          &ldquo;Strike a light instantly,&rdquo; said the Captain; &ldquo;I will examine  this said purse; and if it be as this fellow says, the Jew&rsquo;s bounty is  little less miraculous than the stream which relieved his fathers in the  wilderness.&rdquo;          A light was procured accordingly, and the robber proceeded to examine the  purse. The others crowded around him, and even two who had hold of Gurth  relaxed their grasp while they stretched their necks to see the issue of the  search. Availing himself of their negligence, by a sudden exertion of strength  and activity, Gurth shook himself free of their hold, and might have escaped,  could he have resolved to leave his master&rsquo;s property behind him. But  such was no part of his intention. He wrenched a quarter-staff from one of the  fellows, struck down the Captain, who was altogether unaware of his purpose,  and had well-nigh repossessed himself of the pouch and treasure. The thieves,  however, were too nimble for him, and again secured both the bag and the trusty  Gurth.          &ldquo;Knave!&rdquo; said the Captain, getting up, &ldquo;thou hast broken my  head; and with other men of our sort thou wouldst fare the worse for thy  insolence. But thou shalt know thy fate instantly. First let us speak of thy  master; the knight&rsquo;s matters must go before the squire&rsquo;s, according  to the due order of chivalry. Stand thou fast in the meantime&mdash;if thou  stir again, thou shalt have that will make thee quiet for thy  life&mdash;Comrades!&rdquo; he then said, addressing his gang, &ldquo;this  purse is embroidered with Hebrew characters, and I well believe the  yeoman&rsquo;s tale is true. The errant knight, his master, must needs pass us  toll-free. He is too like ourselves for us to make booty of him, since dogs  should not worry dogs where wolves and foxes are to be found in  abundance.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Like us?&rdquo; answered one of the gang; &ldquo;I should like to hear  how that is made good.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Why, thou fool,&rdquo; answered the Captain, &ldquo;is he not poor and  disinherited as we are?&mdash;Doth he not win his substance at the  sword&rsquo;s point as we do?&mdash;Hath he not beaten Front-de-Bœuf and  Malvoisin, even as we would beat them if we could? Is he not the enemy to life  and death of Brian de Bois-Guilbert, whom we have so much reason to fear? And  were all this otherwise, wouldst thou have us show a worse conscience than an  unbeliever, a Hebrew Jew?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay, that were a shame,&rdquo; muttered the other fellow; &ldquo;and  yet, when I served in the band of stout old Gandelyn, we had no such scruples  of conscience. And this insolent peasant,&mdash;he too, I warrant me, is to be  dismissed scatheless?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Not if THOU canst scathe him,&rdquo; replied the  Captain.&mdash;&ldquo;Here, fellow,&rdquo; continued he, addressing Gurth,  &ldquo;canst thou use the staff, that thou starts to it so readily?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Gurth, &ldquo;thou shouldst be best able to reply  to that question.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay, by my troth, thou gavest me a round knock,&rdquo; replied the  Captain; &ldquo;do as much for this fellow, and thou shalt pass scot-free; and  if thou dost not&mdash;why, by my faith, as thou art such a sturdy knave, I  think I must pay thy ransom myself.&mdash;Take thy staff, Miller,&rdquo; he  added, &ldquo;and keep thy head; and do you others let the fellow go, and give  him a staff&mdash;there is light enough to lay on load by.&rdquo;          The two champions being alike armed with quarter-staves, stepped forward into  the centre of the open space, in order to have the full benefit of the  moonlight; the thieves in the meantime laughing, and crying to their comrade,  &ldquo;Miller! beware thy toll-dish.&rdquo; The Miller, on the other hand,  holding his quarter-staff by the middle, and making it flourish round his head  after the fashion which the French call &ldquo;faire le moulinet&rdquo;,  exclaimed boastfully, &ldquo;Come on, churl, an thou darest: thou shalt feel  the strength of a miller&rsquo;s thumb!&rdquo;                      &ldquo;If thou be&rsquo;st a miller,&rdquo; answered Gurth, undauntedly, making  his weapon play around his head with equal dexterity, &ldquo;thou art doubly a  thief, and I, as a true man, bid thee defiance.&rdquo;          So saying, the two champions closed together, and for a few minutes they  displayed great equality in strength, courage, and skill, intercepting and  returning the blows of their adversary with the most rapid dexterity, while,  from the continued clatter of their weapons, a person at a distance might have  supposed that there were at least six persons engaged on each side. Less  obstinate, and even less dangerous combats, have been described in good heroic  verse; but that of Gurth and the Miller must remain unsung, for want of a  sacred poet to do justice to its eventful progress. Yet, though quarter-staff  play be out of date, what we can in prose we will do for these bold champions.          Long they fought equally, until the Miller began to lose temper at finding  himself so stoutly opposed, and at hearing the laughter of his companions, who,  as usual in such cases, enjoyed his vexation. This was not a state of mind  favourable to the noble game of quarter-staff, in which, as in ordinary  cudgel-playing, the utmost coolness is requisite; and it gave Gurth, whose  temper was steady, though surly, the opportunity of acquiring a decided  advantage, in availing himself of which he displayed great mastery.          The Miller pressed furiously forward, dealing blows with either end of his  weapon alternately, and striving to come to half-staff distance, while Gurth  defended himself against the attack, keeping his hands about a yard asunder,  and covering himself by shifting his weapon with great celerity, so as to  protect his head and body. Thus did he maintain the defensive, making his eye,  foot, and hand keep true time, until, observing his antagonist to lose wind, he  darted the staff at his face with his left hand; and, as the Miller endeavoured  to parry the thrust, he slid his right hand down to his left, and with the full  swing of the weapon struck his opponent on the left side of the head, who  instantly measured his length upon the green sward.          &ldquo;Well and yeomanly done!&rdquo; shouted the robbers; &ldquo;fair play and  Old England for ever! The Saxon hath saved both his purse and his hide, and the  Miller has met his match.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou mayst go thy ways, my friend,&rdquo; said the Captain, addressing  Gurth, in special confirmation of the general voice, &ldquo;and I will cause  two of my comrades to guide thee by the best way to thy master&rsquo;s  pavilion, and to guard thee from night-walkers that might have less tender  consciences than ours; for there is many one of them upon the amble in such a  night as this. Take heed, however,&rdquo; he added sternly; &ldquo;remember  thou hast refused to tell thy name&mdash;ask not after ours, nor endeavour to  discover who or what we are; for, if thou makest such an attempt, thou wilt  come by worse fortune than has yet befallen thee.&rdquo;          Gurth thanked the Captain for his courtesy, and promised to attend to his  recommendation. Two of the outlaws, taking up their quarter-staves, and  desiring Gurth to follow close in the rear, walked roundly forward along a  by-path, which traversed the thicket and the broken ground adjacent to it. On  the very verge of the thicket two men spoke to his conductors, and receiving an  answer in a whisper, withdrew into the wood, and suffered them to pass  unmolested. This circumstance induced Gurth to believe both that the gang was  strong in numbers, and that they kept regular guards around their place of  rendezvous.          When they arrived on the open heath, where Gurth might have had some trouble in  finding his road, the thieves guided him straight forward to the top of a  little eminence, whence he could see, spread beneath him in the moonlight, the  palisades of the lists, the glimmering pavilions pitched at either end, with  the pennons which adorned them fluttering in the moonbeams, and from which  could be heard the hum of the song with which the sentinels were beguiling  their night-watch.          Here the thieves stopt.          &ldquo;We go with you no farther,&rdquo; said they; &ldquo;it were not safe  that we should do so.&mdash;Remember the warning you have received&mdash;keep  secret what has this night befallen you, and you will have no room to repent  it&mdash;neglect what is now told you, and the Tower of London shall not  protect you against our revenge.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Good night to you, kind sirs,&rdquo; said Gurth; &ldquo;I shall remember  your orders, and trust that there is no offence in wishing you a safer and an  honester trade.&rdquo;          Thus they parted, the outlaws returning in the direction from whence they had  come, and Gurth proceeding to the tent of his master, to whom, notwithstanding  the injunction he had received, he communicated the whole adventures of the  evening.          The Disinherited Knight was filled with astonishment, no less at the generosity  of Rebecca, by which, however, he resolved he would not profit, than that of  the robbers, to whose profession such a quality seemed totally foreign. His  course of reflections upon these singular circumstances was, however,  interrupted by the necessity for taking repose, which the fatigue of the  preceding day, and the propriety of refreshing himself for the morrow&rsquo;s  encounter, rendered alike indispensable.          The knight, therefore, stretched himself for repose upon a rich couch with  which the tent was provided; and the faithful Gurth, extending his hardy limbs  upon a bear-skin which formed a sort of carpet to the pavilion, laid himself  across the opening of the tent, so that no one could enter without awakening  him.                     CHAPTER XII        The heralds left their pricking up and down,   Now ringen trumpets loud and clarion.   There is no more to say, but east and west,   In go the speares sadly in the rest,   In goth the sharp spur into the side,   There see men who can just and who can ride;   There shiver shaftes upon shieldes thick,   He feeleth through the heart-spone the prick;   Up springen speares, twenty feet in height,   Out go the swordes to the silver bright;   The helms they to-hewn and to-shred;   Out burst the blood with stern streames red.          C HAUCER           Morning arose in unclouded splendour, and ere the sun was much above the  horizon, the idlest or the most eager of the spectators appeared on the common,  moving to the lists as to a general centre, in order to secure a favourable  situation for viewing the continuation of the expected games.          The marshals and their attendants appeared next on the field, together with the  heralds, for the purpose of receiving the names of the knights who intended to  joust, with the side which each chose to espouse. This was a necessary  precaution, in order to secure equality betwixt the two bodies who should be  opposed to each other.          According to due formality, the Disinherited Knight was to be considered as  leader of the one body, while Brian de Bois-Guilbert, who had been rated as  having done second-best in the preceding day, was named first champion of the  other band. Those who had concurred in the challenge adhered to his party of  course, excepting only Ralph de Vipont, whom his fall had rendered unfit so  soon to put on his armour. There was no want of distinguished and noble  candidates to fill up the ranks on either side.          In fact, although the general tournament, in which all knights fought at once,  was more dangerous than single encounters, they were, nevertheless, more  frequented and practised by the chivalry of the age. Many knights, who had not  sufficient confidence in their own skill to defy a single adversary of high  reputation, were, nevertheless, desirous of displaying their valour in the  general combat, where they might meet others with whom they were more upon an  equality. On the present occasion, about fifty knights were inscribed as  desirous of combating upon each side, when the marshals declared that no more  could be admitted, to the disappointment of several who were too late in  preferring their claim to be included.          About the hour of ten o&rsquo;clock, the whole plain was crowded with horsemen,  horsewomen, and foot-passengers, hastening to the tournament; and shortly  after, a grand flourish of trumpets announced Prince John and his retinue,  attended by many of those knights who meant to take share in the game, as well  as others who had no such intention.          About the same time arrived Cedric the Saxon, with the Lady Rowena, unattended,  however, by Athelstane. This Saxon lord had arrayed his tall and strong person  in armour, in order to take his place among the combatants; and, considerably  to the surprise of Cedric, had chosen to enlist himself on the part of the  Knight Templar. The Saxon, indeed, had remonstrated strongly with his friend  upon the injudicious choice he had made of his party; but he had only received  that sort of answer usually given by those who are more obstinate in following  their own course, than strong in justifying it.          His best, if not his only reason, for adhering to the party of Brian de  Bois-Guilbert, Athelstane had the prudence to keep to himself. Though his  apathy of disposition prevented his taking any means to recommend himself to  the Lady Rowena, he was, nevertheless, by no means insensible to her charms,  and considered his union with her as a matter already fixed beyond doubt, by  the assent of Cedric and her other friends. It had therefore been with  smothered displeasure that the proud though indolent Lord of Coningsburgh  beheld the victor of the preceding day select Rowena as the object of that  honour which it became his privilege to confer. In order to punish him for a  preference which seemed to interfere with his own suit, Athelstane, confident  of his strength, and to whom his flatterers, at least, ascribed great skill in  arms, had determined not only to deprive the Disinherited Knight of his  powerful succour, but, if an opportunity should occur, to make him feel the  weight of his battle-axe.          De Bracy, and other knights attached to Prince John, in obedience to a hint  from him, had joined the party of the challengers, John being desirous to  secure, if possible, the victory to that side. On the other hand, many other  knights, both English and Norman, natives and strangers, took part against the  challengers, the more readily that the opposite band was to be led by so  distinguished a champion as the Disinherited Knight had approved himself.          As soon as Prince John observed that the destined Queen of the day had arrived  upon the field, assuming that air of courtesy which sat well upon him when he  was pleased to exhibit it, he rode forward to meet her, doffed his bonnet, and,  alighting from his horse, assisted the Lady Rowena from her saddle, while his  followers uncovered at the same time, and one of the most distinguished  dismounted to hold her palfrey.          &ldquo;It is thus,&rdquo; said Prince John, &ldquo;that we set the dutiful  example of loyalty to the Queen of Love and Beauty, and are ourselves her guide  to the throne which she must this day occupy.&mdash;Ladies,&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;attend your Queen, as you wish in your turn to be distinguished by like  honours.&rdquo;          So saying, the Prince marshalled Rowena to the seat of honour opposite his own,  while the fairest and most distinguished ladies present crowded after her to  obtain places as near as possible to their temporary sovereign.          No sooner was Rowena seated, than a burst of music, half-drowned by the shouts  of the multitude, greeted her new dignity. Meantime, the sun shone fierce and  bright upon the polished arms of the knights of either side, who crowded the  opposite extremities of the lists, and held eager conference together  concerning the best mode of arranging their line of battle, and supporting the  conflict.          The heralds then proclaimed silence until the laws of the tourney should be  rehearsed. These were calculated in some degree to abate the dangers of the  day; a precaution the more necessary, as the conflict was to be maintained with  sharp swords and pointed lances.          The champions were therefore prohibited to thrust with the sword, and were  confined to striking. A knight, it was announced, might use a mace or  battle-axe at pleasure, but the dagger was a prohibited weapon. A knight  unhorsed might renew the fight on foot with any other on the opposite side in  the same predicament; but mounted horsemen were in that case forbidden to  assail him. When any knight could force his antagonist to the extremity of the  lists, so as to touch the palisade with his person or arms, such opponent was  obliged to yield himself vanquished, and his armour and horse were placed at  the disposal of the conqueror. A knight thus overcome was not permitted to take  farther share in the combat. If any combatant was struck down, and unable to  recover his feet, his squire or page might enter the lists, and drag his master  out of the press; but in that case the knight was adjudged vanquished, and his  arms and horse declared forfeited. The combat was to cease as soon as Prince  John should throw down his leading staff, or truncheon; another precaution  usually taken to prevent the unnecessary effusion of blood by the too long  endurance of a sport so desperate. Any knight breaking the rules of the  tournament, or otherwise transgressing the rules of honourable chivalry, was  liable to be stript of his arms, and, having his shield reversed to be placed  in that posture astride upon the bars of the palisade, and exposed to public  derision, in punishment of his unknightly conduct. Having announced these  precautions, the heralds concluded with an exhortation to each good knight to  do his duty, and to merit favour from the Queen of Beauty and of Love.          This proclamation having been made, the heralds withdrew to their stations. The  knights, entering at either end of the lists in long procession, arranged  themselves in a double file, precisely opposite to each other, the leader of  each party being in the centre of the foremost rank, a post which he did not  occupy until each had carefully marshalled the ranks of his party, and  stationed every one in his place.          It was a goodly, and at the same time an anxious, sight, to behold so many  gallant champions, mounted bravely, and armed richly, stand ready prepared for  an encounter so formidable, seated on their war-saddles like so many pillars of  iron, and awaiting the signal of encounter with the same ardour as their  generous steeds, which, by neighing and pawing the ground, gave signal of their  impatience.          As yet the knights held their long lances upright, their bright points glancing  to the sun, and the streamers with which they were decorated fluttering over  the plumage of the helmets. Thus they remained while the marshals of the field  surveyed their ranks with the utmost exactness, lest either party had more or  fewer than the appointed number. The tale was found exactly complete. The  marshals then withdrew from the lists, and William de Wyvil, with a voice of  thunder, pronounced the signal words&mdash;&ldquo;Laissez aller!&rdquo; The  trumpets sounded as he spoke&mdash;the spears of the champions were at once  lowered and placed in the rests&mdash;the spurs were dashed into the flanks of  the horses, and the two foremost ranks of either party rushed upon each other  in full gallop, and met in the middle of the lists with a shock, the sound of  which was heard at a mile&rsquo;s distance. The rear rank of each party  advanced at a slower pace to sustain the defeated, and follow up the success of  the victors of their party.          The consequences of the encounter were not instantly seen, for the dust raised  by the trampling of so many steeds darkened the air, and it was a minute ere  the anxious spectator could see the fate of the encounter. When the fight  became visible, half the knights on each side were dismounted, some by the  dexterity of their adversary&rsquo;s lance,&mdash;some by the superior weight  and strength of opponents, which had borne down both horse and man,&mdash;some  lay stretched on earth as if never more to rise,&mdash;some had already gained  their feet, and were closing hand to hand with those of their antagonists who  were in the same predicament,&mdash;and several on both sides, who had received  wounds by which they were disabled, were stopping their blood by their scarfs,  and endeavouring to extricate themselves from the tumult. The mounted knights,  whose lances had been almost all broken by the fury of the encounter, were now  closely engaged with their swords, shouting their war-cries, and exchanging  buffets, as if honour and life depended on the issue of the combat.          The tumult was presently increased by the advance of the second rank on either  side, which, acting as a reserve, now rushed on to aid their companions. The  followers of Brian de Bois-Guilbert shouted&mdash;&ldquo;Ha! Beau-seant!  Beau-seant!   20            &ldquo;&mdash;For the Temple&mdash;For the Temple!&rdquo; The opposite party  shouted in answer&mdash;&ldquo;Desdichado! Desdichado!&rdquo;&mdash;which  watch-word they took from the motto upon their leader&rsquo;s shield.          The champions thus encountering each other with the utmost fury, and with  alternate success, the tide of battle seemed to flow now toward the southern,  now toward the northern extremity of the lists, as the one or the other party  prevailed. Meantime the clang of the blows, and the shouts of the combatants,  mixed fearfully with the sound of the trumpets, and drowned the groans of those  who fell, and lay rolling defenceless beneath the feet of the horses. The  splendid armour of the combatants was now defaced with dust and blood, and gave  way at every stroke of the sword and battle-axe. The gay plumage, shorn from  the crests, drifted upon the breeze like snow-flakes. All that was beautiful  and graceful in the martial array had disappeared, and what was now visible was  only calculated to awake terror or compassion.          Yet such is the force of habit, that not only the vulgar spectators, who are  naturally attracted by sights of horror, but even the ladies of distinction who  crowded the galleries, saw the conflict with a thrilling interest certainly,  but without a wish to withdraw their eyes from a sight so terrible. Here and  there, indeed, a fair cheek might turn pale, or a faint scream might be heard,  as a lover, a brother, or a husband, was struck from his horse. But, in  general, the ladies around encouraged the combatants, not only by clapping  their hands and waving their veils and kerchiefs, but even by exclaiming,  &ldquo;Brave lance! Good sword!&rdquo; when any successful thrust or blow took  place under their observation.          Such being the interest taken by the fair sex in this bloody game, that of the  men is the more easily understood. It showed itself in loud acclamations upon  every change of fortune, while all eyes were so riveted on the lists, that the  spectators seemed as if they themselves had dealt and received the blows which  were there so freely bestowed. And between every pause was heard the voice of  the heralds, exclaiming, &ldquo;Fight on, brave knights! Man dies, but glory  lives!&mdash;Fight on&mdash;death is better than defeat!&mdash;Fight on, brave  knights!&mdash;for bright eyes behold your deeds!&rdquo;          Amid the varied fortunes of the combat, the eyes of all endeavoured to discover  the leaders of each band, who, mingling in the thick of the fight, encouraged  their companions both by voice and example. Both displayed great feats of  gallantry, nor did either Bois-Guilbert or the Disinherited Knight find in the  ranks opposed to them a champion who could be termed their unquestioned match.  They repeatedly endeavoured to single out each other, spurred by mutual  animosity, and aware that the fall of either leader might be considered as  decisive of victory. Such, however, was the crowd and confusion, that, during  the earlier part of the conflict, their efforts to meet were unavailing, and  they were repeatedly separated by the eagerness of their followers, each of  whom was anxious to win honour, by measuring his strength against the leader of  the opposite party.          But when the field became thin by the numbers on either side who had yielded  themselves vanquished, had been compelled to the extremity of the lists, or  been otherwise rendered incapable of continuing the strife, the Templar and the  Disinherited Knight at length encountered hand to hand, with all the fury that  mortal animosity, joined to rivalry of honour, could inspire. Such was the  address of each in parrying and striking, that the spectators broke forth into  a unanimous and involuntary shout, expressive of their delight and admiration.          But at this moment the party of the Disinherited Knight had the worst; the  gigantic arm of Front-de-Bœuf on the one flank, and the ponderous strength of  Athelstane on the other, bearing down and dispersing those immediately exposed  to them. Finding themselves freed from their immediate antagonists, it seems to  have occurred to both these knights at the same instant, that they would render  the most decisive advantage to their party, by aiding the Templar in his  contest with his rival. Turning their horses, therefore, at the same moment,  the Norman spurred against the Disinherited Knight on the one side, and the  Saxon on the other. It was utterly impossible that the object of this unequal  and unexpected assault could have sustained it, had he not been warned by a  general cry from the spectators, who could not but take interest in one exposed  to such disadvantage.          &ldquo;Beware! beware! Sir Disinherited!&rdquo; was shouted so universally,  that the knight became aware of his danger; and, striking a full blow at the  Templar, he reined back his steed in the same moment, so as to escape the  charge of Athelstane and Front-de-Bœuf. These knights, therefore, their aim  being thus eluded, rushed from opposite sides betwixt the object of their  attack and the Templar, almost running their horses against each other ere they  could stop their career. Recovering their horses however, and wheeling them  round, the whole three pursued their united purpose of bearing to the earth the  Disinherited Knight.          Nothing could have saved him, except the remarkable strength and activity of  the noble horse which he had won on the preceding day.          This stood him in the more stead, as the horse of Bois-Guilbert was wounded,  and those of Front-de-Bœuf and Athelstane were both tired with the weight of  their gigantic masters, clad in complete armour, and with the preceding  exertions of the day. The masterly horsemanship of the Disinherited Knight, and  the activity of the noble animal which he mounted, enabled him for a few  minutes to keep at sword&rsquo;s point his three antagonists, turning and  wheeling with the agility of a hawk upon the wing, keeping his enemies as far  separate as he could, and rushing now against the one, now against the other,  dealing sweeping blows with his sword, without waiting to receive those which  were aimed at him in return.          But although the lists rang with the applauses of his dexterity, it was evident  that he must at last be overpowered; and the nobles around Prince John implored  him with one voice to throw down his warder, and to save so brave a knight from  the disgrace of being overcome by odds.          &ldquo;Not I, by the light of Heaven!&rdquo; answered Prince John; &ldquo;this  same springald, who conceals his name, and despises our proffered hospitality,  hath already gained one prize, and may now afford to let others have their  turn.&rdquo; As he spoke thus, an unexpected incident changed the fortune of  the day.          There was among the ranks of the Disinherited Knight a champion in black  armour, mounted on a black horse, large of size, tall, and to all appearance  powerful and strong, like the rider by whom he was mounted. This knight, who  bore on his shield no device of any kind, had hitherto evinced very little  interest in the event of the fight, beating off with seeming ease those  combatants who attacked him, but neither pursuing his advantages, nor himself  assailing any one. In short, he had hitherto acted the part rather of a  spectator than of a party in the tournament, a circumstance which procured him  among the spectators the name of &ldquo;Le Noir Faineant&rdquo;, or the Black  Sluggard.          At once this knight seemed to throw aside his apathy, when he discovered the  leader of his party so hard bestead; for, setting spurs to his horse, which was  quite fresh, he came to his assistance like a thunderbolt, exclaiming, in a  voice like a trumpet-call, &ldquo;Desdichado, to the rescue!&rdquo; It was high  time; for, while the Disinherited Knight was pressing upon the Templar,  Front-de-Bœuf had got nigh to him with his uplifted sword; but ere the blow  could descend, the Sable Knight dealt a stroke on his head, which, glancing  from the polished helmet, lighted with violence scarcely abated on the  &ldquo;chamfron&rdquo; of the steed, and Front-de-Bœuf rolled on the ground,  both horse and man equally stunned by the fury of the blow. &ldquo;Le Noir  Faineant&rdquo; then turned his horse upon Athelstane of Coningsburgh; and his  own sword having been broken in his encounter with Front-de-Bœuf, he wrenched  from the hand of the bulky Saxon the battle-axe which he wielded, and, like one  familiar with the use of the weapon, bestowed him such a blow upon the crest,  that Athelstane also lay senseless on the field. Having achieved this double  feat, for which he was the more highly applauded that it was totally unexpected  from him, the knight seemed to resume the sluggishness of his character,  returning calmly to the northern extremity of the lists, leaving his leader to  cope as he best could with Brian de Bois-Guilbert. This was no longer matter of  so much difficulty as formerly. The Templars horse had bled much, and gave way  under the shock of the Disinherited Knight&rsquo;s charge. Brian de  Bois-Guilbert rolled on the field, encumbered with the stirrup, from which he  was unable to draw his foot. His antagonist sprung from horseback, waved his  fatal sword over the head of his adversary, and commanded him to yield himself;  when Prince John, more moved by the Templars dangerous situation than he had  been by that of his rival, saved him the mortification of confessing himself  vanquished, by casting down his warder, and putting an end to the conflict.          It was, indeed, only the relics and embers of the fight which continued to  burn; for of the few knights who still continued in the lists, the greater part  had, by tacit consent, forborne the conflict for some time, leaving it to be  determined by the strife of the leaders.          The squires, who had found it a matter of danger and difficulty to attend their  masters during the engagement, now thronged into the lists to pay their dutiful  attendance to the wounded, who were removed with the utmost care and attention  to the neighbouring pavilions, or to the quarters prepared for them in the  adjoining village.          Thus ended the memorable field of Ashby-de-la-Zouche, one of the most gallantly  contested tournaments of that age; for although only four knights, including  one who was smothered by the heat of his armour, had died upon the field, yet  upwards of thirty were desperately wounded, four or five of whom never  recovered. Several more were disabled for life; and those who escaped best  carried the marks of the conflict to the grave with them. Hence it is always  mentioned in the old records, as the Gentle and Joyous Passage of Arms of  Ashby.          It being now the duty of Prince John to name the knight who had done best, he  determined that the honour of the day remained with the knight whom the popular  voice had termed &ldquo;Le Noir Faineant.&rdquo; It was pointed out to the  Prince, in impeachment of this decree, that the victory had been in fact won by  the Disinherited Knight, who, in the course of the day, had overcome six  champions with his own hand, and who had finally unhorsed and struck down the  leader of the opposite party. But Prince John adhered to his own opinion, on  the ground that the Disinherited Knight and his party had lost the day, but for  the powerful assistance of the Knight of the Black Armour, to whom, therefore,  he persisted in awarding the prize.          To the surprise of all present, however, the knight thus preferred was nowhere  to be found. He had left the lists immediately when the conflict ceased, and  had been observed by some spectators to move down one of the forest glades with  the same slow pace and listless and indifferent manner which had procured him  the epithet of the Black Sluggard. After he had been summoned twice by sound of  trumpet, and proclamation of the heralds, it became necessary to name another  to receive the honours which had been assigned to him. Prince John had now no  further excuse for resisting the claim of the Disinherited Knight, whom,  therefore, he named the champion of the day.          Through a field slippery with blood, and encumbered with broken armour and the  bodies of slain and wounded horses, the marshals of the lists again conducted  the victor to the foot of Prince John&rsquo;s throne.          &ldquo;Disinherited Knight,&rdquo; said Prince John, &ldquo;since by that title  only you will consent to be known to us, we a second time award to you the  honours of this tournament, and announce to you your right to claim and receive  from the hands of the Queen of Love and Beauty, the Chaplet of Honour which  your valour has justly deserved.&rdquo; The Knight bowed low and gracefully,  but returned no answer.          While the trumpets sounded, while the heralds strained their voices in  proclaiming honour to the brave and glory to the victor&mdash;while ladies  waved their silken kerchiefs and embroidered veils, and while all ranks joined  in a clamorous shout of exultation, the marshals conducted the Disinherited  Knight across the lists to the foot of that throne of honour which was occupied  by the Lady Rowena.          On the lower step of this throne the champion was made to kneel down. Indeed  his whole action since the fight had ended, seemed rather to have been upon the  impulse of those around him than from his own free will; and it was observed  that he tottered as they guided him the second time across the lists. Rowena,  descending from her station with a graceful and dignified step, was about to  place the chaplet which she held in her hand upon the helmet of the champion,  when the marshals exclaimed with one voice, &ldquo;It must not be  thus&mdash;his head must be bare.&rdquo; The knight muttered faintly a few  words, which were lost in the hollow of his helmet, but their purport seemed to  be a desire that his casque might not be removed.          Whether from love of form, or from curiosity, the marshals paid no attention to  his expressions of reluctance, but unhelmed him by cutting the laces of his  casque, and undoing the fastening of his gorget. When the helmet was removed,  the well-formed, yet sun-burnt features of a young man of twenty-five were  seen, amidst a profusion of short fair hair. His countenance was as pale as  death, and marked in one or two places with streaks of blood.                      Rowena had no sooner beheld him than she uttered a faint shriek; but at once  summoning up the energy of her disposition, and compelling herself, as it were,  to proceed, while her frame yet trembled with the violence of sudden emotion,  she placed upon the drooping head of the victor the splendid chaplet which was  the destined reward of the day, and pronounced, in a clear and distinct tone,  these words: &ldquo;I bestow on thee this chaplet, Sir Knight, as the meed of  valour assigned to this day&rsquo;s victor:&rdquo; Here she paused a moment,  and then firmly added, &ldquo;And upon brows more worthy could a wreath of  chivalry never be placed!&rdquo;          The knight stooped his head, and kissed the hand of the lovely Sovereign by  whom his valour had been rewarded; and then, sinking yet farther forward, lay  prostrate at her feet.          There was a general consternation. Cedric, who had been struck mute by the  sudden appearance of his banished son, now rushed forward, as if to separate  him from Rowena. But this had been already accomplished by the marshals of the  field, who, guessing the cause of Ivanhoe&rsquo;s swoon, had hastened to undo  his armour, and found that the head of a lance had penetrated his breastplate,  and inflicted a wound in his side.                     CHAPTER XIII        &ldquo;Heroes, approach!&rdquo; Atrides thus aloud,   &ldquo;Stand forth distinguish&rsquo;d from the circling crowd,   Ye who by skill or manly force may claim,   Your rivals to surpass and merit fame.   This cow, worth twenty oxen, is decreed,   For him who farthest sends the winged reed.&rdquo;          I LIAD           The name of Ivanhoe was no sooner pronounced than it flew from mouth to mouth,  with all the celerity with which eagerness could convey and curiosity receive  it. It was not long ere it reached the circle of the Prince, whose brow  darkened as he heard the news. Looking around him, however, with an air of  scorn, &ldquo;My Lords,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and especially you, Sir Prior,  what think ye of the doctrine the learned tell us, concerning innate  attractions and antipathies? Methinks that I felt the presence of my  brother&rsquo;s minion, even when I least guessed whom yonder suit of armour  enclosed.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Front-de-Bœuf must prepare to restore his fief of Ivanhoe,&rdquo; said  De Bracy, who, having discharged his part honourably in the tournament, had  laid his shield and helmet aside, and again mingled with the Prince&rsquo;s  retinue.          &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; answered Waldemar Fitzurse, &ldquo;this gallant is likely to  reclaim the castle and manor which Richard assigned to him, and which your  Highness&rsquo;s generosity has since given to Front-de-Bœuf.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Front-de-Bœuf,&rdquo; replied John, &ldquo;is a man more willing to  swallow three manors such as Ivanhoe, than to disgorge one of them. For the  rest, sirs, I hope none here will deny my right to confer the fiefs of the  crown upon the faithful followers who are around me, and ready to perform the  usual military service, in the room of those who have wandered to foreign  Countries, and can neither render homage nor service when called upon.&rdquo;          The audience were too much interested in the question not to pronounce the  Prince&rsquo;s assumed right altogether indubitable. &ldquo;A generous  Prince!&mdash;a most noble Lord, who thus takes upon himself the task of  rewarding his faithful followers!&rdquo;          Such were the words which burst from the train, expectants all of them of  similar grants at the expense of King Richard&rsquo;s followers and favourites,  if indeed they had not as yet received such. Prior Aymer also assented to the  general proposition, observing, however, &ldquo;That the blessed Jerusalem  could not indeed be termed a foreign country. She was &lsquo;communis  mater&rsquo;&mdash;the mother of all Christians. But he saw not,&rdquo; he  declared, &ldquo;how the Knight of Ivanhoe could plead any advantage from this,  since he&rdquo; (the Prior) &ldquo;was assured that the crusaders, under  Richard, had never proceeded much farther than Askalon, which, as all the world  knew, was a town of the Philistines, and entitled to none of the privileges of  the Holy City.&rdquo;          Waldemar, whose curiosity had led him towards the place where Ivanhoe had  fallen to the ground, now returned. &ldquo;The gallant,&rdquo; said he,  &ldquo;is likely to give your Highness little disturbance, and to leave  Front-de-Bœuf in the quiet possession of his gains&mdash;he is severely  wounded.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Whatever becomes of him,&rdquo; said Prince John, &ldquo;he is victor of  the day; and were he tenfold our enemy, or the devoted friend of our brother,  which is perhaps the same, his wounds must be looked to&mdash;our own physician  shall attend him.&rdquo;          A stern smile curled the Prince&rsquo;s lip as he spoke. Waldemar Fitzurse  hastened to reply, that Ivanhoe was already removed from the lists, and in the  custody of his friends.          &ldquo;I was somewhat afflicted,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to see the grief of the  Queen of Love and Beauty, whose sovereignty of a day this event has changed  into mourning. I am not a man to be moved by a woman&rsquo;s lament for her  lover, but this same Lady Rowena suppressed her sorrow with such dignity of  manner, that it could only be discovered by her folded hands, and her tearless  eye, which trembled as it remained fixed on the lifeless form before  her.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Who is this Lady Rowena,&rdquo; said Prince John, &ldquo;of whom we have  heard so much?&rdquo;          &ldquo;A Saxon heiress of large possessions,&rdquo; replied the Prior Aymer;  &ldquo;a rose of loveliness, and a jewel of wealth; the fairest among a  thousand, a bundle of myrrh, and a cluster of camphire.&rdquo;          &ldquo;We shall cheer her sorrows,&rdquo; said Prince John, &ldquo;and amend  her blood, by wedding her to a Norman. She seems a minor, and must therefore be  at our royal disposal in marriage.&mdash;How sayst thou, De Bracy? What thinkst  thou of gaining fair lands and livings, by wedding a Saxon, after the fashion  of the followers of the Conqueror?&rdquo;          &ldquo;If the lands are to my liking, my lord,&rdquo; answered De Bracy,  &ldquo;it will be hard to displease me with a bride; and deeply will I hold  myself bound to your highness for a good deed, which will fulfil all promises  made in favour of your servant and vassal.&rdquo;          &ldquo;We will not forget it,&rdquo; said Prince John; &ldquo;and that we may  instantly go to work, command our seneschal presently to order the attendance  of the Lady Rowena and her company&mdash;that is, the rude churl her guardian,  and the Saxon ox whom the Black Knight struck down in the tournament, upon this  evening&rsquo;s banquet.&mdash;De Bigot,&rdquo; he added to his seneschal,  &ldquo;thou wilt word this our second summons so courteously, as to gratify the  pride of these Saxons, and make it impossible for them again to refuse;  although, by the bones of Becket, courtesy to them is casting pearls before  swine.&rdquo;          Prince John had proceeded thus far, and was about to give the signal for  retiring from the lists, when a small billet was put into his hand.          &ldquo;From whence?&rdquo; said Prince John, looking at the person by whom it  was delivered.          &ldquo;From foreign parts, my lord, but from whence I know not&rdquo; replied  his attendant. &ldquo;A Frenchman brought it hither, who said, he had ridden  night and day to put it into the hands of your highness.&rdquo;          The Prince looked narrowly at the superscription, and then at the seal, placed  so as to secure the flex-silk with which the billet was surrounded, and which  bore the impression of three fleurs-de-lis. John then opened the billet with  apparent agitation, which visibly and greatly increased when he had perused the  contents, which were expressed in these words:          &ldquo; Take heed to yourself for the Devil is unchained! &rdquo;          The Prince turned as pale as death, looked first on the earth, and then up to  heaven, like a man who has received news that sentence of execution has been  passed upon him. Recovering from the first effects of his surprise, he took  Waldemar Fitzurse and De Bracy aside, and put the billet into their hands  successively. &ldquo;It means,&rdquo; he added, in a faltering voice,  &ldquo;that my brother Richard has obtained his freedom.&rdquo;          &ldquo;This may be a false alarm, or a forged letter,&rdquo; said De Bracy.          &ldquo;It is France&rsquo;s own hand and seal,&rdquo; replied Prince John.          &ldquo;It is time, then,&rdquo; said Fitzurse, &ldquo;to draw our party to a  head, either at York, or some other centrical place. A few days later, and it  will be indeed too late. Your highness must break short this present  mummery.&rdquo;          &ldquo;The yeomen and commons,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;must not be  dismissed discontented, for lack of their share in the sports.&rdquo;          &ldquo;The day,&rdquo; said Waldemar, &ldquo;is not yet very far  spent&mdash;let the archers shoot a few rounds at the target, and the prize be  adjudged. This will be an abundant fulfilment of the Prince&rsquo;s promises,  so far as this herd of Saxon serfs is concerned.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I thank thee, Waldemar,&rdquo; said the Prince; &ldquo;thou remindest  me, too, that I have a debt to pay to that insolent peasant who yesterday  insulted our person. Our banquet also shall go forward to-night as we proposed.  Were this my last hour of power, it should be an hour sacred to revenge and to  pleasure&mdash;let new cares come with to-morrow&rsquo;s new day.&rdquo;          The sound of the trumpets soon recalled those spectators who had already begun  to leave the field; and proclamation was made that Prince John, suddenly called  by high and peremptory public duties, held himself obliged to discontinue the  entertainments of to-morrow&rsquo;s festival: Nevertheless, that, unwilling so  many good yeoman should depart without a trial of skill, he was pleased to  appoint them, before leaving the ground, presently to execute the competition  of archery intended for the morrow. To the best archer a prize was to be  awarded, being a bugle-horn, mounted with silver, and a silken baldric richly  ornamented with a medallion of St Hubert, the patron of silvan sport.          More than thirty yeomen at first presented themselves as competitors, several  of whom were rangers and under-keepers in the royal forests of Needwood and  Charnwood. When, however, the archers understood with whom they were to be  matched, upwards of twenty withdrew themselves from the contest, unwilling to  encounter the dishonour of almost certain defeat. For in those days the skill  of each celebrated marksman was as well known for many miles round him, as the  qualities of a horse trained at Newmarket are familiar to those who frequent  that well-known meeting.          The diminished list of competitors for silvan fame still amounted to eight.  Prince John stepped from his royal seat to view more nearly the persons of  these chosen yeomen, several of whom wore the royal livery. Having satisfied  his curiosity by this investigation, he looked for the object of his  resentment, whom he observed standing on the same spot, and with the same  composed countenance which he had exhibited upon the preceding day.          &ldquo;Fellow,&rdquo; said Prince John, &ldquo;I guessed by thy insolent babble  that thou wert no true lover of the longbow, and I see thou darest not  adventure thy skill among such merry-men as stand yonder.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Under favour, sir,&rdquo; replied the yeoman, &ldquo;I have another  reason for refraining to shoot, besides the fearing discomfiture and  disgrace.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And what is thy other reason?&rdquo; said Prince John, who, for some  cause which perhaps he could not himself have explained, felt a painful  curiosity respecting this individual.          &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; replied the woodsman, &ldquo;I know not if these yeomen  and I are used to shoot at the same marks; and because, moreover, I know not  how your Grace might relish the winning of a third prize by one who has  unwittingly fallen under your displeasure.&rdquo;          Prince John coloured as he put the question, &ldquo;What is thy name,  yeoman?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Locksley,&rdquo; answered the yeoman.          &ldquo;Then, Locksley,&rdquo; said Prince John, &ldquo;thou shalt shoot in thy  turn, when these yeomen have displayed their skill. If thou carriest the prize,  I will add to it twenty nobles; but if thou losest it, thou shalt be stript of  thy Lincoln green, and scourged out of the lists with bowstrings, for a wordy  and insolent braggart.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And how if I refuse to shoot on such a wager?&rdquo; said the  yeoman.&mdash;&ldquo;Your Grace&rsquo;s power, supported, as it is, by so many  men-at-arms, may indeed easily strip and scourge me, but cannot compel me to  bend or to draw my bow.&rdquo;          &ldquo;If thou refusest my fair proffer,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;the  Provost of the lists shall cut thy bowstring, break thy bow and arrows, and  expel thee from the presence as a faint-hearted craven.&rdquo;          &ldquo;This is no fair chance you put on me, proud Prince,&rdquo; said the  yeoman, &ldquo;to compel me to peril myself against the best archers of  Leicester and Staffordshire, under the penalty of infamy if they should  overshoot me. Nevertheless, I will obey your pleasure.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Look to him close, men-at-arms,&rdquo; said Prince John, &ldquo;his  heart is sinking; I am jealous lest he attempt to escape the trial.&mdash;And  do you, good fellows, shoot boldly round; a buck and a butt of wine are ready  for your refreshment in yonder tent, when the prize is won.&rdquo;          A target was placed at the upper end of the southern avenue which led to the  lists. The contending archers took their station in turn, at the bottom of the  southern access, the distance between that station and the mark allowing full  distance for what was called a shot at rovers. The archers, having previously  determined by lot their order of precedence, were to shoot each three shafts in  succession. The sports were regulated by an officer of inferior rank, termed  the Provost of the Games; for the high rank of the marshals of the lists would  have been held degraded, had they condescended to superintend the sports of the  yeomanry.          One by one the archers, stepping forward, delivered their shafts yeomanlike and  bravely. Of twenty-four arrows, shot in succession, ten were fixed in the  target, and the others ranged so near it, that, considering the distance of the  mark, it was accounted good archery. Of the ten shafts which hit the target,  two within the inner ring were shot by Hubert, a forester in the service of  Malvoisin, who was accordingly pronounced victorious.          &ldquo;Now, Locksley,&rdquo; said Prince John to the bold yeoman, with a bitter  smile, &ldquo;wilt thou try conclusions with Hubert, or wilt thou yield up bow,  baldric, and quiver, to the Provost of the sports?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Sith it be no better,&rdquo; said Locksley, &ldquo;I am content to try  my fortune; on condition that when I have shot two shafts at yonder mark of  Hubert&rsquo;s, he shall be bound to shoot one at that which I shall  propose.&rdquo;          &ldquo;That is but fair,&rdquo; answered Prince John, &ldquo;and it shall not  be refused thee.&mdash;If thou dost beat this braggart, Hubert, I will fill the  bugle with silver-pennies for thee.&rdquo;          &ldquo;A man can do but his best,&rdquo; answered Hubert; &ldquo;but my  grandsire drew a good long bow at Hastings, and I trust not to dishonour his  memory.&rdquo;          The former target was now removed, and a fresh one of the same size placed in  its room. Hubert, who, as victor in the first trial of skill, had the right to  shoot first, took his aim with great deliberation, long measuring the distance  with his eye, while he held in his hand his bended bow, with the arrow placed  on the string. At length he made a step forward, and raising the bow at the  full stretch of his left arm, till the centre or grasping-place was nigh level  with his face, he drew his bowstring to his ear. The arrow whistled through the  air, and lighted within the inner ring of the target, but not exactly in the  centre.          &ldquo;You have not allowed for the wind, Hubert,&rdquo; said his antagonist,  bending his bow, &ldquo;or that had been a better shot.&rdquo;          So saying, and without showing the least anxiety to pause upon his aim,  Locksley stept to the appointed station, and shot his arrow as carelessly in  appearance as if he had not even looked at the mark. He was speaking almost at  the instant that the shaft left the bowstring, yet it alighted in the target  two inches nearer to the white spot which marked the centre than that of  Hubert.                      &ldquo;By the light of heaven!&rdquo; said Prince John to Hubert, &ldquo;an  thou suffer that runagate knave to overcome thee, thou art worthy of the  gallows!&rdquo;          Hubert had but one set speech for all occasions. &ldquo;An your highness were  to hang me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a man can but do his best. Nevertheless, my  grandsire drew a good bow&mdash;&rdquo;          &ldquo;The foul fiend on thy grandsire and all his generation!&rdquo;  interrupted John, &ldquo;shoot, knave, and shoot thy best, or it shall be the  worse for thee!&rdquo;          Thus exhorted, Hubert resumed his place, and not neglecting the caution which  he had received from his adversary, he made the necessary allowance for a very  light air of wind, which had just arisen, and shot so successfully that his  arrow alighted in the very centre of the target.          &ldquo;A Hubert! a Hubert!&rdquo; shouted the populace, more interested in a  known person than in a stranger. &ldquo;In the clout!&mdash;in the  clout!&mdash;a Hubert for ever!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou canst not mend that shot, Locksley,&rdquo; said the Prince, with an  insulting smile.          &ldquo;I will notch his shaft for him, however,&rdquo; replied Locksley.          And letting fly his arrow with a little more precaution than before, it lighted  right upon that of his competitor, which it split to shivers. The people who  stood around were so astonished at his wonderful dexterity, that they could not  even give vent to their surprise in their usual clamour. &ldquo;This must be  the devil, and no man of flesh and blood,&rdquo; whispered the yeomen to each  other; &ldquo;such archery was never seen since a bow was first bent in  Britain.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Locksley, &ldquo;I will crave your Grace&rsquo;s  permission to plant such a mark as is used in the North Country; and welcome  every brave yeoman who shall try a shot at it to win a smile from the bonny  lass he loves best.&rdquo;          He then turned to leave the lists. &ldquo;Let your guards attend me,&rdquo; he  said, &ldquo;if you please&mdash;I go but to cut a rod from the next  willow-bush.&rdquo;          Prince John made a signal that some attendants should follow him in case of his  escape: but the cry of &ldquo;Shame! shame!&rdquo; which burst from the  multitude, induced him to alter his ungenerous purpose.          Locksley returned almost instantly with a willow wand about six feet in length,  perfectly straight, and rather thicker than a man&rsquo;s thumb. He began to  peel this with great composure, observing at the same time, that to ask a good  woodsman to shoot at a target so broad as had hitherto been used, was to put  shame upon his skill. &ldquo;For his own part,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and in  the land where he was bred, men would as soon take for their mark King  Arthur&rsquo;s round-table, which held sixty knights around it. A child of  seven years old,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;might hit yonder target with a headless  shaft; but,&rdquo; added he, walking deliberately to the other end of the  lists, and sticking the willow wand upright in the ground, &ldquo;he that hits  that rod at five-score yards, I call him an archer fit to bear both bow and  quiver before a king, an it were the stout King Richard himself.&rdquo;          &ldquo;My grandsire,&rdquo; said Hubert, &ldquo;drew a good bow at the battle  of Hastings, and never shot at such a mark in his life&mdash;and neither will  I. If this yeoman can cleave that rod, I give him the bucklers&mdash;or rather,  I yield to the devil that is in his jerkin, and not to any human skill; a man  can but do his best, and I will not shoot where I am sure to miss. I might as  well shoot at the edge of our parson&rsquo;s whittle, or at a wheat straw, or  at a sunbeam, as at a twinkling white streak which I can hardly see.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Cowardly dog!&rdquo; said Prince John.&mdash;&ldquo;Sirrah Locksley, do  thou shoot; but, if thou hittest such a mark, I will say thou art the first man  ever did so. However it be, thou shalt not crow over us with a mere show of  superior skill.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I will do my best, as Hubert says,&rdquo; answered Locksley; &ldquo;no  man can do more.&rdquo;          So saying, he again bent his bow, but on the present occasion looked with  attention to his weapon, and changed the string, which he thought was no longer  truly round, having been a little frayed by the two former shots. He then took  his aim with some deliberation, and the multitude awaited the event in  breathless silence. The archer vindicated their opinion of his skill: his arrow  split the willow rod against which it was aimed. A jubilee of acclamations  followed; and even Prince John, in admiration of Locksley&rsquo;s skill, lost  for an instant his dislike to his person. &ldquo;These twenty nobles,&rdquo; he  said, &ldquo;which, with the bugle, thou hast fairly won, are thine own; we  will make them fifty, if thou wilt take livery and service with us as a yeoman  of our body guard, and be near to our person. For never did so strong a hand  bend a bow, or so true an eye direct a shaft.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Pardon me, noble Prince,&rdquo; said Locksley; &ldquo;but I have vowed,  that if ever I take service, it should be with your royal brother King Richard.  These twenty nobles I leave to Hubert, who has this day drawn as brave a bow as  his grandsire did at Hastings. Had his modesty not refused the trial, he would  have hit the wand as well I.&rdquo;          Hubert shook his head as he received with reluctance the bounty of the  stranger, and Locksley, anxious to escape further observation, mixed with the  crowd, and was seen no more.          The victorious archer would not perhaps have escaped John&rsquo;s attention so  easily, had not that Prince had other subjects of anxious and more important  meditation pressing upon his mind at that instant. He called upon his  chamberlain as he gave the signal for retiring from the lists, and commanded  him instantly to gallop to Ashby, and seek out Isaac the Jew. &ldquo;Tell the  dog,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to send me, before sun-down, two thousand crowns.  He knows the security; but thou mayst show him this ring for a token. The rest  of the money must be paid at York within six days. If he neglects, I will have  the unbelieving villain&rsquo;s head. Look that thou pass him not on the way;  for the circumcised slave was displaying his stolen finery amongst us.&rdquo;          So saying, the Prince resumed his horse, and returned to Ashby, the whole crowd  breaking up and dispersing upon his retreat.                     CHAPTER XIV        In rough magnificence array&rsquo;d,   When ancient Chivalry display&rsquo;d   The pomp of her heroic games,   And crested chiefs and tissued dames   Assembled, at the clarion&rsquo;s call,   In some proud castle&rsquo;s high arch&rsquo;d hall.          W ARTON           Prince John held his high festival in the Castle of Ashby. This was not the  same building of which the stately ruins still interest the traveller, and  which was erected at a later period by the Lord Hastings, High Chamberlain of  England, one of the first victims of the tyranny of Richard the Third, and yet  better known as one of Shakespeare&rsquo;s characters than by his historical  fame. The castle and town of Ashby, at this time, belonged to Roger de Quincy,  Earl of Winchester, who, during the period of our history, was absent in the  Holy Land. Prince John, in the meanwhile, occupied his castle, and disposed of  his domains without scruple; and seeking at present to dazzle men&rsquo;s eyes  by his hospitality and magnificence, had given orders for great preparations,  in order to render the banquet as splendid as possible.          The purveyors of the Prince, who exercised on this and other occasions the full  authority of royalty, had swept the country of all that could be collected  which was esteemed fit for their master&rsquo;s table. Guests also were invited  in great numbers; and in the necessity in which he then found himself of  courting popularity, Prince John had extended his invitation to a few  distinguished Saxon and Danish families, as well as to the Norman nobility and  gentry of the neighbourhood. However despised and degraded on ordinary  occasions, the great numbers of the Anglo-Saxons must necessarily render them  formidable in the civil commotions which seemed approaching, and it was an  obvious point of policy to secure popularity with their leaders.          It was accordingly the Prince&rsquo;s intention, which he for some time  maintained, to treat these unwonted guests with a courtesy to which they had  been little accustomed. But although no man with less scruple made his ordinary  habits and feelings bend to his interest, it was the misfortune of this Prince,  that his levity and petulance were perpetually breaking out, and undoing all  that had been gained by his previous dissimulation.          Of this fickle temper he gave a memorable example in Ireland, when sent thither  by his father, Henry the Second, with the purpose of buying golden opinions of  the inhabitants of that new and important acquisition to the English crown.  Upon this occasion the Irish chieftains contended which should first offer to  the young Prince their loyal homage and the kiss of peace. But, instead of  receiving their salutations with courtesy, John and his petulant attendants  could not resist the temptation of pulling the long beards of the Irish  chieftains; a conduct which, as might have been expected, was highly resented  by these insulted dignitaries, and produced fatal consequences to the English  domination in Ireland. It is necessary to keep these inconsistencies of  John&rsquo;s character in view, that the reader may understand his conduct  during the present evening.          In execution of the resolution which he had formed during his cooler moments,  Prince John received Cedric and Athelstane with distinguished courtesy, and  expressed his disappointment, without resentment, when the indisposition of  Rowena was alleged by the former as a reason for her not attending upon his  gracious summons. Cedric and Athelstane were both dressed in the ancient Saxon  garb, which, although not unhandsome in itself, and in the present instance  composed of costly materials, was so remote in shape and appearance from that  of the other guests, that Prince John took great credit to himself with  Waldemar Fitzurse for refraining from laughter at a sight which the fashion of  the day rendered ridiculous. Yet, in the eye of sober judgment, the short close  tunic and long mantle of the Saxons was a more graceful, as well as a more  convenient dress, than the garb of the Normans, whose under garment was a long  doublet, so loose as to resemble a shirt or waggoner&rsquo;s frock, covered by  a cloak of scanty dimensions, neither fit to defend the wearer from cold or  from rain, and the only purpose of which appeared to be to display as much fur,  embroidery, and jewellery work, as the ingenuity of the tailor could contrive  to lay upon it. The Emperor Charlemagne, in whose reign they were first  introduced, seems to have been very sensible of the inconveniences arising from  the fashion of this garment. &ldquo;In Heaven&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; said he,  &ldquo;to what purpose serve these abridged cloaks? If we are in bed they are  no cover, on horseback they are no protection from the wind and rain, and when  seated, they do not guard our legs from the damp or the frost.&rdquo;          Nevertheless, spite of this imperial objurgation, the short cloaks continued in  fashion down to the time of which we treat, and particularly among the princes  of the House of Anjou. They were therefore in universal use among Prince  John&rsquo;s courtiers; and the long mantle, which formed the upper garment of  the Saxons, was held in proportional derision.          The guests were seated at a table which groaned under the quantity of good  cheer. The numerous cooks who attended on the Prince&rsquo;s progress, having  exerted all their art in varying the forms in which the ordinary provisions  were served up, had succeeded almost as well as the modern professors of the  culinary art in rendering them perfectly unlike their natural appearance.  Besides these dishes of domestic origin, there were various delicacies brought  from foreign parts, and a quantity of rich pastry, as well as of the  simnel-bread and wastle cakes, which were only used at the tables of the  highest nobility. The banquet was crowned with the richest wines, both foreign  and domestic.          But, though luxurious, the Norman nobles were not generally speaking an  intemperate race. While indulging themselves in the pleasures of the table,  they aimed at delicacy, but avoided excess, and were apt to attribute gluttony  and drunkenness to the vanquished Saxons, as vices peculiar to their inferior  station. Prince John, indeed, and those who courted his pleasure by imitating  his foibles, were apt to indulge to excess in the pleasures of the trencher and  the goblet; and indeed it is well known that his death was occasioned by a  surfeit upon peaches and new ale. His conduct, however, was an exception to the  general manners of his countrymen.          With sly gravity, interrupted only by private signs to each other, the Norman  knights and nobles beheld the ruder demeanour of Athelstane and Cedric at a  banquet, to the form and fashion of which they were unaccustomed. And while  their manners were thus the subject of sarcastic observation, the untaught  Saxons unwittingly transgressed several of the arbitrary rules established for  the regulation of society. Now, it is well known, that a man may with more  impunity be guilty of an actual breach either of real good breeding or of good  morals, than appear ignorant of the most minute point of fashionable etiquette.  Thus Cedric, who dried his hands with a towel, instead of suffering the  moisture to exhale by waving them gracefully in the air, incurred more ridicule  than his companion Athelstane, when he swallowed to his own single share the  whole of a large pasty composed of the most exquisite foreign delicacies, and  termed at that time a &ldquo;Karum-Pie&rdquo;. When, however, it was  discovered, by a serious cross-examination, that the Thane of Coningsburgh (or  Franklin, as the Normans termed him) had no idea what he had been devouring,  and that he had taken the contents of the Karum-pie for larks and pigeons,  whereas they were in fact beccaficoes and nightingales, his ignorance brought  him in for an ample share of the ridicule which would have been more justly  bestowed on his gluttony.          The long feast had at length its end; and, while the goblet circulated freely,  men talked of the feats of the preceding tournament,&mdash;of the unknown  victor in the archery games, of the Black Knight, whose self-denial had induced  him to withdraw from the honours he had won,&mdash;and of the gallant Ivanhoe,  who had so dearly bought the honours of the day. The topics were treated with  military frankness, and the jest and laugh went round the hall. The brow of  Prince John alone was overclouded during these discussions; some overpowering  care seemed agitating his mind, and it was only when he received occasional  hints from his attendants, that he seemed to take interest in what was passing  around him. On such occasions he would start up, quaff a cup of wine as if to  raise his spirits, and then mingle in the conversation by some observation made  abruptly or at random.          &ldquo;We drink this beaker,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to the health of Wilfred of  Ivanhoe, champion of this Passage of Arms, and grieve that his wound renders  him absent from our board&mdash;Let all fill to the pledge, and especially  Cedric of Rotherwood, the worthy father of a son so promising.&rdquo;          &ldquo;No, my lord,&rdquo; replied Cedric, standing up, and placing on the  table his untasted cup, &ldquo;I yield not the name of son to the disobedient  youth, who at once despises my commands, and relinquishes the manners and  customs of his fathers.&rdquo;          &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis impossible,&rdquo; cried Prince John, with well-feigned  astonishment, &ldquo;that so gallant a knight should be an unworthy or  disobedient son!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Yet, my lord,&rdquo; answered Cedric, &ldquo;so it is with this Wilfred.  He left my homely dwelling to mingle with the gay nobility of your  brother&rsquo;s court, where he learned to do those tricks of horsemanship  which you prize so highly. He left it contrary to my wish and command; and in  the days of Alfred that would have been termed disobedience&mdash;ay, and a  crime severely punishable.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; replied Prince John, with a deep sigh of affected sympathy,  &ldquo;since your son was a follower of my unhappy brother, it need not be  enquired where or from whom he learned the lesson of filial  disobedience.&rdquo;          Thus spake Prince John, wilfully forgetting, that of all the sons of Henry the  Second, though no one was free from the charge, he himself had been most  distinguished for rebellion and ingratitude to his father.          &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said he, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, &ldquo;that my  brother proposed to confer upon his favourite the rich manor of Ivanhoe.&rdquo;          &ldquo;He did endow him with it,&rdquo; answered Cedric; &ldquo;nor is it my  least quarrel with my son, that he stooped to hold, as a feudal vassal, the  very domains which his fathers possessed in free and independent right.&rdquo;          &ldquo;We shall then have your willing sanction, good Cedric,&rdquo; said  Prince John, &ldquo;to confer this fief upon a person whose dignity will not be  diminished by holding land of the British crown.&mdash;Sir Reginald  Front-de-Bœuf,&rdquo; he said, turning towards that Baron, &ldquo;I trust you  will so keep the goodly Barony of Ivanhoe, that Sir Wilfred shall not incur his  father&rsquo;s farther displeasure by again entering upon that fief.&rdquo;          &ldquo;By St Anthony!&rdquo; answered the black-brow&rsquo;d giant, &ldquo;I  will consent that your highness shall hold me a Saxon, if either Cedric or  Wilfred, or the best that ever bore English blood, shall wrench from me the  gift with which your highness has graced me.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Whoever shall call thee Saxon, Sir Baron,&rdquo; replied Cedric,  offended at a mode of expression by which the Normans frequently expressed  their habitual contempt of the English, &ldquo;will do thee an honour as great  as it is undeserved.&rdquo;          Front-de-Bœuf would have replied, but Prince John&rsquo;s petulance and levity  got the start.          &ldquo;Assuredly,&rdquo; said be, &ldquo;my lords, the noble Cedric speaks  truth; and his race may claim precedence over us as much in the length of their  pedigrees as in the longitude of their cloaks.&rdquo;          &ldquo;They go before us indeed in the field&mdash;as deer before dogs,&rdquo;  said Malvoisin.          &ldquo;And with good right may they go before us&mdash;forget not,&rdquo; said  the Prior Aymer, &ldquo;the superior decency and decorum of their  manners.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Their singular abstemiousness and temperance,&rdquo; said De Bracy,  forgetting the plan which promised him a Saxon bride.          &ldquo;Together with the courage and conduct,&rdquo; said Brian de  Bois-Guilbert, &ldquo;by which they distinguished themselves at Hastings and  elsewhere.&rdquo;          While, with smooth and smiling cheek, the courtiers, each in turn, followed  their Prince&rsquo;s example, and aimed a shaft of ridicule at Cedric, the face  of the Saxon became inflamed with passion, and he glanced his eyes fiercely  from one to another, as if the quick succession of so many injuries had  prevented his replying to them in turn; or, like a baited bull, who, surrounded  by his tormentors, is at a loss to choose from among them the immediate object  of his revenge. At length he spoke, in a voice half choked with passion; and,  addressing himself to Prince John as the head and front of the offence which he  had received, &ldquo;Whatever,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have been the follies and  vices of our race, a Saxon would have been held &lsquo;nidering&rsquo;,&rdquo;    21   (the most emphatic term for abject  worthlessness,) &ldquo;who should in his own hall, and while his own wine-cup  passed, have treated, or suffered to be treated, an unoffending guest as your  highness has this day beheld me used; and whatever was the misfortune of our  fathers on the field of Hastings, those may at least be silent,&rdquo; here he  looked at Front-de-Bœuf and the Templar, &ldquo;who have within these few  hours once and again lost saddle and stirrup before the lance of a  Saxon.&rdquo;          &ldquo;By my faith, a biting jest!&rdquo; said Prince John. &ldquo;How like you  it, sirs?&mdash;Our Saxon subjects rise in spirit and courage; become shrewd in  wit, and bold in bearing, in these unsettled times&mdash;What say ye, my  lords?&mdash;By this good light, I hold it best to take our galleys, and return  to Normandy in time.&rdquo;          &ldquo;For fear of the Saxons?&rdquo; said De Bracy, laughing; &ldquo;we should  need no weapon but our hunting spears to bring these boars to bay.&rdquo;          &ldquo;A truce with your raillery, Sir Knights,&rdquo; said  Fitzurse;&mdash;&ldquo;and it were well,&rdquo; he added, addressing the  Prince, &ldquo;that your highness should assure the worthy Cedric there is no  insult intended him by jests, which must sound but harshly in the ear of a  stranger.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Insult?&rdquo; answered Prince John, resuming his courtesy of demeanour;  &ldquo;I trust it will not be thought that I could mean, or permit any, to be  offered in my presence. Here! I fill my cup to Cedric himself, since he refuses  to pledge his son&rsquo;s health.&rdquo;          The cup went round amid the well-dissembled applause of the courtiers, which,  however, failed to make the impression on the mind of the Saxon that had been  designed. He was not naturally acute of perception, but those too much  undervalued his understanding who deemed that this flattering compliment would  obliterate the sense of the prior insult. He was silent, however, when the  royal pledge again passed round, &ldquo;To Sir Athelstane of  Coningsburgh.&rdquo;          The knight made his obeisance, and showed his sense of the honour by draining a  huge goblet in answer to it.          &ldquo;And now, sirs,&rdquo; said Prince John, who began to be warmed with the  wine which he had drank, &ldquo;having done justice to our Saxon guests, we  will pray of them some requital to our courtesy.&mdash;Worthy Thane,&rdquo; he  continued, addressing Cedric, &ldquo;may we pray you to name to us some Norman  whose mention may least sully your mouth, and to wash down with a goblet of  wine all bitterness which the sound may leave behind it?&rdquo;          Fitzurse arose while Prince John spoke, and gliding behind the seat of the  Saxon, whispered to him not to omit the opportunity of putting an end to  unkindness betwixt the two races, by naming Prince John. The Saxon replied not  to this politic insinuation, but, rising up, and filling his cup to the brim,  he addressed Prince John in these words: &ldquo;Your highness has required that  I should name a Norman deserving to be remembered at our banquet. This,  perchance, is a hard task, since it calls on the slave to sing the praises of  the master&mdash;upon the vanquished, while pressed by all the evils of  conquest, to sing the praises of the conqueror. Yet I will name a  Norman&mdash;the first in arms and in place&mdash;the best and the noblest of  his race. And the lips that shall refuse to pledge me to his well-earned fame,  I term false and dishonoured, and will so maintain them with my life.&mdash;I  quaff this goblet to the health of Richard the Lion-hearted!&rdquo;          Prince John, who had expected that his own name would have closed the  Saxon&rsquo;s speech, started when that of his injured brother was so  unexpectedly introduced. He raised mechanically the wine-cup to his lips, then  instantly set it down, to view the demeanour of the company at this unexpected  proposal, which many of them felt it as unsafe to oppose as to comply with.  Some of them, ancient and experienced courtiers, closely imitated the example  of the Prince himself, raising the goblet to their lips, and again replacing it  before them. There were many who, with a more generous feeling, exclaimed,  &ldquo;Long live King Richard! and may he be speedily restored to us!&rdquo;  And some few, among whom were Front-de-Bœuf and the Templar, in sullen disdain  suffered their goblets to stand untasted before them. But no man ventured  directly to gainsay a pledge filled to the health of the reigning monarch.          Having enjoyed his triumph for about a minute, Cedric said to his companion,  &ldquo;Up, noble Athelstane! we have remained here long enough, since we have  requited the hospitable courtesy of Prince John&rsquo;s banquet. Those who wish  to know further of our rude Saxon manners must henceforth seek us in the homes  of our fathers, since we have seen enough of royal banquets, and enough of  Norman courtesy.&rdquo;          So saying, he arose and left the banqueting room, followed by Athelstane, and  by several other guests, who, partaking of the Saxon lineage, held themselves  insulted by the sarcasms of Prince John and his courtiers.          &ldquo;By the bones of St Thomas,&rdquo; said Prince John, as they retreated,  &ldquo;the Saxon churls have borne off the best of the day, and have retreated  with triumph!&rdquo;          &ldquo;&lsquo;Conclamatum est, poculatum est&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Prior Aymer;  &ldquo;we have drunk and we have shouted,&mdash;it were time we left our wine  flagons.&rdquo;          &ldquo;The monk hath some fair penitent to shrive to-night, that he is in such  a hurry to depart,&rdquo; said De Bracy.          &ldquo;Not so, Sir Knight,&rdquo; replied the Abbot; &ldquo;but I must move  several miles forward this evening upon my homeward journey.&rdquo;          &ldquo;They are breaking up,&rdquo; said the Prince in a whisper to Fitzurse;  &ldquo;their fears anticipate the event, and this coward Prior is the first to  shrink from me.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Fear not, my lord,&rdquo; said Waldemar; &ldquo;I will show him such  reasons as shall induce him to join us when we hold our meeting at  York.&mdash;Sir Prior,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I must speak with you in private,  before you mount your palfrey.&rdquo;          The other guests were now fast dispersing, with the exception of those  immediately attached to Prince John&rsquo;s faction, and his retinue.          &ldquo;This, then, is the result of your advice,&rdquo; said the Prince,  turning an angry countenance upon Fitzurse; &ldquo;that I should be bearded at  my own board by a drunken Saxon churl, and that, on the mere sound of my  brother&rsquo;s name, men should fall off from me as if I had the  leprosy?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Have patience, sir,&rdquo; replied his counsellor; &ldquo;I might retort  your accusation, and blame the inconsiderate levity which foiled my design, and  misled your own better judgment. But this is no time for recrimination. De  Bracy and I will instantly go among these shuffling cowards, and convince them  they have gone too far to recede.&rdquo;          &ldquo;It will be in vain,&rdquo; said Prince John, pacing the apartment with  disordered steps, and expressing himself with an agitation to which the wine he  had drank partly contributed&mdash;&ldquo;It will be in vain&mdash;they have  seen the handwriting on the wall&mdash;they have marked the paw of the lion in  the sand&mdash;they have heard his approaching roar shake the  wood&mdash;nothing will reanimate their courage.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Would to God,&rdquo; said Fitzurse to De Bracy, &ldquo;that aught could  reanimate his own! His brother&rsquo;s very name is an ague to him. Unhappy are  the counsellors of a Prince, who wants fortitude and perseverance alike in good  and in evil!&rdquo;                     CHAPTER XV        And yet he thinks,&mdash;ha, ha, ha, ha,&mdash;he thinks   I am the tool and servant of his will.   Well, let it be; through all the maze of trouble   His plots and base oppression must create,   I&rsquo;ll shape myself a way to higher things,   And who will say &rsquo;tis wrong?          B ASIL, A  T RAGEDY           No spider ever took more pains to repair the shattered meshes of his web, than  did Waldemar Fitzurse to reunite and combine the scattered members of Prince  John&rsquo;s cabal. Few of these were attached to him from inclination, and  none from personal regard. It was therefore necessary, that Fitzurse should  open to them new prospects of advantage, and remind them of those which they at  present enjoyed. To the young and wild nobles, he held out the prospect of  unpunished license and uncontrolled revelry; to the ambitious, that of power,  and to the covetous, that of increased wealth and extended domains. The leaders  of the mercenaries received a donation in gold; an argument the most persuasive  to their minds, and without which all others would have proved in vain.  Promises were still more liberally distributed than money by this active agent;  and, in fine, nothing was left undone that could determine the wavering, or  animate the disheartened. The return of King Richard he spoke of as an event  altogether beyond the reach of probability; yet, when he observed, from the  doubtful looks and uncertain answers which he received, that this was the  apprehension by which the minds of his accomplices were most haunted, he boldly  treated that event, should it really take place, as one which ought not to  alter their political calculations.          &ldquo;If Richard returns,&rdquo; said Fitzurse, &ldquo;he returns to enrich  his needy and impoverished crusaders at the expense of those who did not follow  him to the Holy Land. He returns to call to a fearful reckoning, those who,  during his absence, have done aught that can be construed offence or  encroachment upon either the laws of the land or the privileges of the crown.  He returns to avenge upon the Orders of the Temple and the Hospital, the  preference which they showed to Philip of France during the wars in the Holy  Land. He returns, in fine, to punish as a rebel every adherent of his brother  Prince John. Are ye afraid of his power?&rdquo; continued the artful confident  of that Prince, &ldquo;we acknowledge him a strong and valiant knight; but  these are not the days of King Arthur, when a champion could encounter an army.  If Richard indeed comes back, it must be  alone,&mdash;unfollowed&mdash;unfriended. The bones of his gallant army have  whitened the sands of Palestine. The few of his followers who have returned  have straggled hither like this Wilfred of Ivanhoe, beggared and broken  men.&mdash;And what talk ye of Richard&rsquo;s right of birth?&rdquo; he  proceeded, in answer to those who objected scruples on that head. &ldquo;Is  Richard&rsquo;s title of primogeniture more decidedly certain than that of Duke  Robert of Normandy, the Conqueror&rsquo;s eldest son? And yet William the Red,  and Henry, his second and third brothers, were successively preferred to him by  the voice of the nation, Robert had every merit which can be pleaded for  Richard; he was a bold knight, a good leader, generous to his friends and to  the church, and, to crown the whole, a crusader and a conqueror of the Holy  Sepulchre; and yet he died a blind and miserable prisoner in the Castle of  Cardiff, because he opposed himself to the will of the people, who chose that  he should not rule over them. It is our right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to choose  from the blood royal the prince who is best qualified to hold the supreme  power&mdash;that is,&rdquo; said he, correcting himself, &ldquo;him whose  election will best promote the interests of the nobility. In personal  qualifications,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;it was possible that Prince John might  be inferior to his brother Richard; but when it was considered that the latter  returned with the sword of vengeance in his hand, while the former held out  rewards, immunities, privileges, wealth, and honours, it could not be doubted  which was the king whom in wisdom the nobility were called on to  support.&rdquo;          These, and many more arguments, some adapted to the peculiar circumstances of  those whom he addressed, had the expected weight with the nobles of Prince  John&rsquo;s faction. Most of them consented to attend the proposed meeting at  York, for the purpose of making general arrangements for placing the crown upon  the head of Prince John.          It was late at night, when, worn out and exhausted with his various exertions,  however gratified with the result, Fitzurse, returning to the Castle of Ashby,  met with De Bracy, who had exchanged his banqueting garments for a short green  kirtle, with hose of the same cloth and colour, a leathern cap or head-piece, a  short sword, a horn slung over his shoulder, a long bow in his hand, and a  bundle of arrows stuck in his belt. Had Fitzurse met this figure in an outer  apartment, he would have passed him without notice, as one of the yeomen of the  guard; but finding him in the inner hall, he looked at him with more attention,  and recognised the Norman knight in the dress of an English yeoman.          &ldquo;What mummery is this, De Bracy?&rdquo; said Fitzurse, somewhat angrily;  &ldquo;is this a time for Christmas gambols and quaint maskings, when the fate  of our master, Prince John, is on the very verge of decision? Why hast thou not  been, like me, among these heartless cravens, whom the very name of King  Richard terrifies, as it is said to do the children of the Saracens?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I have been attending to mine own business,&rdquo; answered De Bracy  calmly, &ldquo;as you, Fitzurse, have been minding yours.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I minding mine own business!&rdquo; echoed Waldemar; &ldquo;I have been  engaged in that of Prince John, our joint patron.&rdquo;          &ldquo;As if thou hadst any other reason for that, Waldemar,&rdquo; said De  Bracy, &ldquo;than the promotion of thine own individual interest? Come,  Fitzurse, we know each other&mdash;ambition is thy pursuit, pleasure is mine,  and they become our different ages. Of Prince John thou thinkest as I do; that  he is too weak to be a determined monarch, too tyrannical to be an easy  monarch, too insolent and presumptuous to be a popular monarch, and too fickle  and timid to be long a monarch of any kind. But he is a monarch by whom  Fitzurse and De Bracy hope to rise and thrive; and therefore you aid him with  your policy, and I with the lances of my Free Companions.&rdquo;          &ldquo;A hopeful auxiliary,&rdquo; said Fitzurse impatiently; &ldquo;playing  the fool in the very moment of utter necessity.&mdash;What on earth dost thou  purpose by this absurd disguise at a moment so urgent?&rdquo;          &ldquo;To get me a wife,&rdquo; answered De Bracy coolly, &ldquo;after the  manner of the tribe of Benjamin.&rdquo;          &ldquo;The tribe of Benjamin?&rdquo; said Fitzurse; &ldquo;I comprehend thee  not.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Wert thou not in presence yester-even,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;when  we heard the Prior Aymer tell us a tale in reply to the romance which was sung  by the Minstrel?&mdash;He told how, long since in Palestine, a deadly feud  arose between the tribe of Benjamin and the rest of the Israelitish nation; and  how they cut to pieces well-nigh all the chivalry of that tribe; and how they  swore by our blessed Lady, that they would not permit those who remained to  marry in their lineage; and how they became grieved for their vow, and sent to  consult his holiness the Pope how they might be absolved from it; and how, by  the advice of the Holy Father, the youth of the tribe of Benjamin carried off  from a superb tournament all the ladies who were there present, and thus won  them wives without the consent either of their brides or their brides&rsquo;  families.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I have heard the story,&rdquo; said Fitzurse, &ldquo;though either the  Prior or thou has made some singular alterations in date and  circumstances.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I tell thee,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;that I mean to purvey me a  wife after the fashion of the tribe of Benjamin; which is as much as to say,  that in this same equipment I will fall upon that herd of Saxon bullocks, who  have this night left the castle, and carry off from them the lovely  Rowena.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Art thou mad, De Bracy?&rdquo; said Fitzurse. &ldquo;Bethink thee that,  though the men be Saxons, they are rich and powerful, and regarded with the  more respect by their countrymen, that wealth and honour are but the lot of few  of Saxon descent.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And should belong to none,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;the work of the  Conquest should be completed.&rdquo;          &ldquo;This is no time for it at least,&rdquo; said Fitzurse &ldquo;the  approaching crisis renders the favour of the multitude indispensable, and  Prince John cannot refuse justice to any one who injures their  favourites.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Let him grant it, if he dare,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;he will soon  see the difference betwixt the support of such a lusty lot of spears as mine,  and that of a heartless mob of Saxon churls. Yet I mean no immediate discovery  of myself. Seem I not in this garb as bold a forester as ever blew horn? The  blame of the violence shall rest with the outlaws of the Yorkshire forests. I  have sure spies on the Saxon&rsquo;s motions&mdash;To-night they sleep in the  convent of Saint Wittol, or Withold, or whatever they call that churl of a  Saxon Saint at Burton-on-Trent. Next day&rsquo;s march brings them within our  reach, and, falcon-ways, we swoop on them at once. Presently after I will  appear in mine own shape, play the courteous knight, rescue the unfortunate and  afflicted fair one from the hands of the rude ravishers, conduct her to  Front-de-Bœuf&rsquo;s Castle, or to Normandy, if it should be necessary, and  produce her not again to her kindred until she be the bride and dame of Maurice  de Bracy.&rdquo;          &ldquo;A marvellously sage plan,&rdquo; said Fitzurse, &ldquo;and, as I think,  not entirely of thine own device.&mdash;Come, be frank, De Bracy, who aided  thee in the invention? and who is to assist in the execution? for, as I think,  thine own band lies as far off as York.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Marry, if thou must needs know,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;it was the  Templar Brian de Bois-Guilbert that shaped out the enterprise, which the  adventure of the men of Benjamin suggested to me. He is to aid me in the  onslaught, and he and his followers will personate the outlaws, from whom my  valorous arm is, after changing my garb, to rescue the lady.&rdquo;          &ldquo;By my halidome,&rdquo; said Fitzurse, &ldquo;the plan was worthy of your  united wisdom! and thy prudence, De Bracy, is most especially manifested in the  project of leaving the lady in the hands of thy worthy confederate. Thou mayst,  I think, succeed in taking her from her Saxon friends, but how thou wilt rescue  her afterwards from the clutches of Bois-Guilbert seems considerably more  doubtful&mdash;He is a falcon well accustomed to pounce on a partridge, and to  hold his prey fast.&rdquo;          &ldquo;He is a Templar,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;and cannot therefore rival  me in my plan of wedding this heiress;&mdash;and to attempt aught dishonourable  against the intended bride of De Bracy&mdash;By Heaven! were he a whole Chapter  of his Order in his single person, he dared not do me such an injury!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Then since nought that I can say,&rdquo; said Fitzurse, &ldquo;will put  this folly from thy imagination, (for well I know the obstinacy of thy  disposition,) at least waste as little time as possible&mdash;let not thy folly  be lasting as well as untimely.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I tell thee,&rdquo; answered De Bracy, &ldquo;that it will be the work  of a few hours, and I shall be at York&mdash;at the head of my daring and  valorous fellows, as ready to support any bold design as thy policy can be to  form one.&mdash;But I hear my comrades assembling, and the steeds stamping and  neighing in the outer court.&mdash;Farewell.&mdash;I go, like a true knight, to  win the smiles of beauty.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Like a true knight?&rdquo; repeated Fitzurse, looking after him;  &ldquo;like a fool, I should say, or like a child, who will leave the most  serious and needful occupation, to chase the down of the thistle that drives  past him.&mdash;But it is with such tools that I must work;&mdash;and for whose  advantage?&mdash;For that of a Prince as unwise as he is profligate, and as  likely to be an ungrateful master as he has already proved a rebellious son and  an unnatural brother.&mdash;But he&mdash;he, too, is but one of the tools with  which I labour; and, proud as he is, should he presume to separate his interest  from mine, this is a secret which he shall soon learn.&rdquo;          The meditations of the statesman were here interrupted by the voice of the  Prince from an interior apartment, calling out, &ldquo;Noble Waldemar  Fitzurse!&rdquo; and, with bonnet doffed, the future Chancellor (for to such  high preferment did the wily Norman aspire) hastened to receive the orders of  the future sovereign.                     CHAPTER XVI        Far in a wild, unknown to public view,   From youth to age a reverend hermit grew;   The moss his bed, the cave his humble cell,   His food the fruits, his drink the crystal well   Remote from man, with God he pass&rsquo;d his days,   Prayer all his business&mdash;all his pleasure praise.          P ARNELL           The reader cannot have forgotten that the event of the tournament was decided  by the exertions of an unknown knight, whom, on account of the passive and  indifferent conduct which he had manifested on the former part of the day, the  spectators had entitled, &ldquo;Le Noir Faineant&rdquo;. This knight had left  the field abruptly when the victory was achieved; and when he was called upon  to receive the reward of his valour, he was nowhere to be found. In the  meantime, while summoned by heralds and by trumpets, the knight was holding his  course northward, avoiding all frequented paths, and taking the shortest road  through the woodlands. He paused for the night at a small hostelry lying out of  the ordinary route, where, however, he obtained from a wandering minstrel news  of the event of the tourney.          On the next morning the knight departed early, with the intention of making a  long journey; the condition of his horse, which he had carefully spared during  the preceding morning, being such as enabled him to travel far without the  necessity of much repose. Yet his purpose was baffled by the devious paths  through which he rode, so that when evening closed upon him, he only found  himself on the frontiers of the West Riding of Yorkshire. By this time both  horse and man required refreshment, and it became necessary, moreover, to look  out for some place in which they might spend the night, which was now fast  approaching.          The place where the traveller found himself seemed unpropitious for obtaining  either shelter or refreshment, and he was likely to be reduced to the usual  expedient of knights-errant, who, on such occasions, turned their horses to  graze, and laid themselves down to meditate on their lady-mistress, with an  oak-tree for a canopy. But the Black Knight either had no mistress to meditate  upon, or, being as indifferent in love as he seemed to be in war, was not  sufficiently occupied by passionate reflections upon her beauty and cruelty, to  be able to parry the effects of fatigue and hunger, and suffer love to act as a  substitute for the solid comforts of a bed and supper. He felt dissatisfied,  therefore, when, looking around, he found himself deeply involved in woods,  through which indeed there were many open glades, and some paths, but such as  seemed only formed by the numerous herds of cattle which grazed in the forest,  or by the animals of chase, and the hunters who made prey of them.          The sun, by which the knight had chiefly directed his course, had now sunk  behind the Derbyshire hills on his left, and every effort which he might make  to pursue his journey was as likely to lead him out of his road as to advance  him on his route. After having in vain endeavoured to select the most beaten  path, in hopes it might lead to the cottage of some herdsman, or the silvan  lodge of a forester, and having repeatedly found himself totally unable to  determine on a choice, the knight resolved to trust to the sagacity of his  horse; experience having, on former occasions, made him acquainted with the  wonderful talent possessed by these animals for extricating themselves and  their riders on such emergencies.          The good steed, grievously fatigued with so long a day&rsquo;s journey under a  rider cased in mail, had no sooner found, by the slackened reins, that he was  abandoned to his own guidance, than he seemed to assume new strength and  spirit; and whereas, formerly he had scarce replied to the spur, otherwise than  by a groan, he now, as if proud of the confidence reposed in him, pricked up  his ears, and assumed, of his own accord, a more lively motion. The path which  the animal adopted rather turned off from the course pursued by the knight  during the day; but as the horse seemed confident in his choice, the rider  abandoned himself to his discretion.          He was justified by the event; for the footpath soon after appeared a little  wider and more worn, and the tinkle of a small bell gave the knight to  understand that he was in the vicinity of some chapel or hermitage.          Accordingly, he soon reached an open plat of turf, on the opposite side of  which, a rock, rising abruptly from a gently sloping plain, offered its grey  and weatherbeaten front to the traveller. Ivy mantled its sides in some places,  and in others oaks and holly bushes, whose roots found nourishment in the  cliffs of the crag, waved over the precipices below, like the plumage of the  warrior over his steel helmet, giving grace to that whose chief expression was  terror. At the bottom of the rock, and leaning, as it were, against it, was  constructed a rude hut, built chiefly of the trunks of trees felled in the  neighbouring forest, and secured against the weather by having its crevices  stuffed with moss mingled with clay. The stem of a young fir-tree lopped of its  branches, with a piece of wood tied across near the top, was planted upright by  the door, as a rude emblem of the holy cross. At a little distance on the right  hand, a fountain of the purest water trickled out of the rock, and was received  in a hollow stone, which labour had formed into a rustic basin. Escaping from  thence, the stream murmured down the descent by a channel which its course had  long worn, and so wandered through the little plain to lose itself in the  neighbouring wood.          Beside this fountain were the ruins of a very small chapel, of which the roof  had partly fallen in. The building, when entire, had never been above sixteen  feet long by twelve feet in breadth, and the roof, low in proportion, rested  upon four concentric arches which sprung from the four corners of the building,  each supported upon a short and heavy pillar. The ribs of two of these arches  remained, though the roof had fallen down betwixt them; over the others it  remained entire. The entrance to this ancient place of devotion was under a  very low round arch, ornamented by several courses of that zig-zag moulding,  resembling shark&rsquo;s teeth, which appears so often in the more ancient  Saxon architecture. A belfry rose above the porch on four small pillars, within  which hung the green and weatherbeaten bell, the feeble sounds of which had  been some time before heard by the Black Knight.          The whole peaceful and quiet scene lay glimmering in twilight before the eyes  of the traveller, giving him good assurance of lodging for the night; since it  was a special duty of those hermits who dwelt in the woods, to exercise  hospitality towards benighted or bewildered passengers.          Accordingly, the knight took no time to consider minutely the particulars which  we have detailed, but thanking Saint Julian (the patron of travellers) who had  sent him good harbourage, he leaped from his horse and assailed the door of the  hermitage with the butt of his lance, in order to arouse attention and gain  admittance.          It was some time before he obtained any answer, and the reply, when made, was  unpropitious.          &ldquo;Pass on, whosoever thou art,&rdquo; was the answer given by a deep  hoarse voice from within the hut, &ldquo;and disturb not the servant of God and  St Dunstan in his evening devotions.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Worthy father,&rdquo; answered the knight, &ldquo;here is a poor  wanderer bewildered in these woods, who gives thee the opportunity of  exercising thy charity and hospitality.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Good brother,&rdquo; replied the inhabitant of the hermitage, &ldquo;it  has pleased Our Lady and St Dunstan to destine me for the object of those  virtues, instead of the exercise thereof. I have no provisions here which even  a dog would share with me, and a horse of any tenderness of nurture would  despise my couch&mdash;pass therefore on thy way, and God speed thee.&rdquo;          &ldquo;But how,&rdquo; replied the knight, &ldquo;is it possible for me to find  my way through such a wood as this, when darkness is coming on? I pray you,  reverend father as you are a Christian, to undo your door, and at least point  out to me my road.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And I pray you, good Christian brother,&rdquo; replied the anchorite,  &ldquo;to disturb me no more. You have already interrupted one  &lsquo;pater&rsquo;, two &lsquo;aves&rsquo;, and a &lsquo;credo&rsquo;, which  I, miserable sinner that I am, should, according to my vow, have said before  moonrise.&rdquo;          &ldquo;The road&mdash;the road!&rdquo; vociferated the knight, &ldquo;give me  directions for the road, if I am to expect no more from thee.&rdquo;          &ldquo;The road,&rdquo; replied the hermit, &ldquo;is easy to hit. The path  from the wood leads to a morass, and from thence to a ford, which, as the rains  have abated, may now be passable. When thou hast crossed the ford, thou wilt  take care of thy footing up the left bank, as it is somewhat precipitous; and  the path, which hangs over the river, has lately, as I learn, (for I seldom  leave the duties of my chapel,) given way in sundry places. Thou wilt then keep  straight forward&mdash;-&rdquo;          &ldquo;A broken path&mdash;a precipice&mdash;a ford, and a morass!&rdquo; said  the knight interrupting him,&mdash;&ldquo;Sir Hermit, if you were the holiest  that ever wore beard or told bead, you shall scarce prevail on me to hold this  road to-night. I tell thee, that thou, who livest by the charity of the  country&mdash;ill deserved, as I doubt it is&mdash;hast no right to refuse  shelter to the wayfarer when in distress. Either open the door quickly, or, by  the rood, I will beat it down and make entry for myself.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Friend wayfarer,&rdquo; replied the hermit, &ldquo;be not importunate;  if thou puttest me to use the carnal weapon in mine own defence, it will be  e&rsquo;en the worse for you.&rdquo;          At this moment a distant noise of barking and growling, which the traveller had  for some time heard, became extremely loud and furious, and made the knight  suppose that the hermit, alarmed by his threat of making forcible entry, had  called the dogs who made this clamour to aid him in his defence, out of some  inner recess in which they had been kennelled. Incensed at this preparation on  the hermit&rsquo;s part for making good his inhospitable purpose, the knight  struck the door so furiously with his foot, that posts as well as staples shook  with violence.          The anchorite, not caring again to expose his door to a similar shock, now  called out aloud, &ldquo;Patience, patience&mdash;spare thy strength, good  traveller, and I will presently undo the door, though, it may be, my doing so  will be little to thy pleasure.&rdquo;          The door accordingly was opened; and the hermit, a large, strong-built man, in  his sackcloth gown and hood, girt with a rope of rushes, stood before the  knight. He had in one hand a lighted torch, or link, and in the other a baton  of crab-tree, so thick and heavy, that it might well be termed a club. Two  large shaggy dogs, half greyhound half mastiff, stood ready to rush upon the  traveller as soon as the door should be opened. But when the torch glanced upon  the lofty crest and golden spurs of the knight, who stood without, the hermit,  altering probably his original intentions, repressed the rage of his  auxiliaries, and, changing his tone to a sort of churlish courtesy, invited the  knight to enter his hut, making excuse for his unwillingness to open his lodge  after sunset, by alleging the multitude of robbers and outlaws who were abroad,  and who gave no honour to Our Lady or St Dunstan, nor to those holy men who  spent life in their service.          &ldquo;The poverty of your cell, good father,&rdquo; said the knight, looking  around him, and seeing nothing but a bed of leaves, a crucifix rudely carved in  oak, a missal, with a rough-hewn table and two stools, and one or two clumsy  articles of furniture&mdash;&ldquo;the poverty of your cell should seem a  sufficient defence against any risk of thieves, not to mention the aid of two  trusty dogs, large and strong enough, I think, to pull down a stag, and of  course, to match with most men.&rdquo;          &ldquo;The good keeper of the forest,&rdquo; said the hermit, &ldquo;hath  allowed me the use of these animals, to protect my solitude until the times  shall mend.&rdquo;          Having said this, he fixed his torch in a twisted branch of iron which served  for a candlestick; and, placing the oaken trivet before the embers of the fire,  which he refreshed with some dry wood, he placed a stool upon one side of the  table, and beckoned to the knight to do the same upon the other.          They sat down, and gazed with great gravity at each other, each thinking in his  heart that he had seldom seen a stronger or more athletic figure than was  placed opposite to him.          &ldquo;Reverend hermit,&rdquo; said the knight, after looking long and fixedly  at his host, &ldquo;were it not to interrupt your devout meditations, I would  pray to know three things of your holiness; first, where I am to put my  horse?&mdash;secondly, what I can have for supper?&mdash;thirdly, where I am to  take up my couch for the night?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I will reply to you,&rdquo; said the hermit, &ldquo;with my finger, it  being against my rule to speak by words where signs can answer the  purpose.&rdquo; So saying, he pointed successively to two corners of the hut.  &ldquo;Your stable,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is there&mdash;your bed there;  and,&rdquo; reaching down a platter with two handfuls of parched pease upon it  from the neighbouring shelf, and placing it upon the table, he added,  &ldquo;your supper is here.&rdquo;          The knight shrugged his shoulders, and leaving the hut, brought in his horse,  (which in the interim he had fastened to a tree,) unsaddled him with much  attention, and spread upon the steed&rsquo;s weary back his own mantle.          The hermit was apparently somewhat moved to compassion by the anxiety as well  as address which the stranger displayed in tending his horse; for, muttering  something about provender left for the keeper&rsquo;s palfrey, he dragged out  of a recess a bundle of forage, which he spread before the knight&rsquo;s  charger, and immediately afterwards shook down a quantity of dried fern in the  corner which he had assigned for the rider&rsquo;s couch. The knight returned  him thanks for his courtesy; and, this duty done, both resumed their seats by  the table, whereon stood the trencher of pease placed between them. The hermit,  after a long grace, which had once been Latin, but of which original language  few traces remained, excepting here and there the long rolling termination of  some word or phrase, set example to his guest, by modestly putting into a very  large mouth, furnished with teeth which might have ranked with those of a boar  both in sharpness and whiteness, some three or four dried pease, a miserable  grist as it seemed for so large and able a mill.          The knight, in order to follow so laudable an example, laid aside his helmet,  his corslet, and the greater part of his armour, and showed to the hermit a  head thick-curled with yellow hair, high features, blue eyes, remarkably bright  and sparkling, a mouth well formed, having an upper lip clothed with mustachoes  darker than his hair, and bearing altogether the look of a bold, daring, and  enterprising man, with which his strong form well corresponded.          The hermit, as if wishing to answer to the confidence of his guest, threw back  his cowl, and showed a round bullet head belonging to a man in the prime of  life. His close-shaven crown, surrounded by a circle of stiff curled black  hair, had something the appearance of a parish pinfold begirt by its high  hedge. The features expressed nothing of monastic austerity, or of ascetic  privations; on the contrary, it was a bold bluff countenance, with broad black  eyebrows, a well-turned forehead, and cheeks as round and vermilion as those of  a trumpeter, from which descended a long and curly black beard. Such a visage,  joined to the brawny form of the holy man, spoke rather of sirloins and  haunches, than of pease and pulse. This incongruity did not escape the guest.  After he had with great difficulty accomplished the mastication of a mouthful  of the dried pease, he found it absolutely necessary to request his pious  entertainer to furnish him with some liquor; who replied to his request by  placing before him a large can of the purest water from the fountain.          &ldquo;It is from the well of St Dunstan,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in which,  betwixt sun and sun, he baptized five hundred heathen Danes and  Britons&mdash;blessed be his name!&rdquo; And applying his black beard to the  pitcher, he took a draught much more moderate in quantity than his encomium  seemed to warrant.          &ldquo;It seems to me, reverend father,&rdquo; said the knight, &ldquo;that the  small morsels which you eat, together with this holy, but somewhat thin  beverage, have thriven with you marvellously. You appear a man more fit to win  the ram at a wrestling match, or the ring at a bout at quarter-staff, or the  bucklers at a sword-play, than to linger out your time in this desolate  wilderness, saying masses, and living upon parched pease and cold water.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Sir Knight,&rdquo; answered the hermit, &ldquo;your thoughts, like those  of the ignorant laity, are according to the flesh. It has pleased Our Lady and  my patron saint to bless the pittance to which I restrain myself, even as the  pulse and water was blessed to the children Shadrach, Meshech, and Abednego,  who drank the same rather than defile themselves with the wine and meats which  were appointed them by the King of the Saracens.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Holy father,&rdquo; said the knight, &ldquo;upon whose countenance it  hath pleased Heaven to work such a miracle, permit a sinful layman to crave thy  name?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou mayst call me,&rdquo; answered the hermit, &ldquo;the Clerk of  Copmanhurst, for so I am termed in these parts&mdash;They add, it is true, the  epithet holy, but I stand not upon that, as being unworthy of such  addition.&mdash;And now, valiant knight, may I pray ye for the name of my  honourable guest?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said the knight, &ldquo;Holy Clerk of Copmanhurst, men  call me in these parts the Black Knight,&mdash;many, sir, add to it the epithet  of Sluggard, whereby I am no way ambitious to be distinguished.&rdquo;          The hermit could scarcely forbear from smiling at his guest&rsquo;s reply.          &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Sir Sluggish Knight, that thou art a man  of prudence and of counsel; and moreover, I see that my poor monastic fare  likes thee not, accustomed, perhaps, as thou hast been, to the license of  courts and of camps, and the luxuries of cities; and now I bethink me, Sir  Sluggard, that when the charitable keeper of this forest-walk left those dogs  for my protection, and also those bundles of forage, he left me also some food,  which, being unfit for my use, the very recollection of it had escaped me amid  my more weighty meditations.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I dare be sworn he did so,&rdquo; said the knight; &ldquo;I was  convinced that there was better food in the cell, Holy Clerk, since you first  doffed your cowl.&mdash;Your keeper is ever a jovial fellow; and none who  beheld thy grinders contending with these pease, and thy throat flooded with  this ungenial element, could see thee doomed to such horse-provender and  horse-beverage,&rdquo; (pointing to the provisions upon the table,) &ldquo;and  refrain from mending thy cheer. Let us see the keeper&rsquo;s bounty,  therefore, without delay.&rdquo;          The hermit cast a wistful look upon the knight, in which there was a sort of  comic expression of hesitation, as if uncertain how far he should act prudently  in trusting his guest. There was, however, as much of bold frankness in the  knight&rsquo;s countenance as was possible to be expressed by features. His  smile, too, had something in it irresistibly comic, and gave an assurance of  faith and loyalty, with which his host could not refrain from sympathizing.          After exchanging a mute glance or two, the hermit went to the further side of  the hut, and opened a hutch, which was concealed with great care and some  ingenuity. Out of the recesses of a dark closet, into which this aperture gave  admittance, he brought a large pasty, baked in a pewter platter of unusual  dimensions. This mighty dish he placed before his guest, who, using his poniard  to cut it open, lost no time in making himself acquainted with its contents.          &ldquo;How long is it since the good keeper has been here?&rdquo; said the  knight to his host, after having swallowed several hasty morsels of this  reinforcement to the hermit&rsquo;s good cheer.          &ldquo;About two months,&rdquo; answered the father hastily.          &ldquo;By the true Lord,&rdquo; answered the knight, &ldquo;every thing in your  hermitage is miraculous, Holy Clerk! for I would have been sworn that the fat  buck which furnished this venison had been running on foot within the  week.&rdquo;          The hermit was somewhat discountenanced by this observation; and, moreover, he  made but a poor figure while gazing on the diminution of the pasty, on which  his guest was making desperate inroads; a warfare in which his previous  profession of abstinence left him no pretext for joining.          &ldquo;I have been in Palestine, Sir Clerk,&rdquo; said the knight, stopping  short of a sudden, &ldquo;and I bethink me it is a custom there that every host  who entertains a guest shall assure him of the wholesomeness of his food, by  partaking of it along with him. Far be it from me to suspect so holy a man of  aught inhospitable; nevertheless I will be highly bound to you would you comply  with this Eastern custom.&rdquo;          &ldquo;To ease your unnecessary scruples, Sir Knight, I will for once depart  from my rule,&rdquo; replied the hermit. And as there were no forks in those  days, his clutches were instantly in the bowels of the pasty.          The ice of ceremony being once broken, it seemed matter of rivalry between the  guest and the entertainer which should display the best appetite; and although  the former had probably fasted longest, yet the hermit fairly surpassed him.          &ldquo;Holy Clerk,&rdquo; said the knight, when his hunger was appeased,  &ldquo;I would gage my good horse yonder against a zecchin, that that same  honest keeper to whom we are obliged for the venison has left thee a stoup of  wine, or a runlet of canary, or some such trifle, by way of ally to this noble  pasty. This would be a circumstance, doubtless, totally unworthy to dwell in  the memory of so rigid an anchorite; yet, I think, were you to search yonder  crypt once more, you would find that I am right in my conjecture.&rdquo;          The hermit only replied by a grin; and returning to the hutch, he produced a  leathern bottle, which might contain about four quarts. He also brought forth  two large drinking cups, made out of the horn of the urus, and hooped with  silver. Having made this goodly provision for washing down the supper, he  seemed to think no farther ceremonious scruple necessary on his part; but  filling both cups, and saying, in the Saxon fashion, &ldquo;&lsquo;Waes  hael&rsquo;, Sir Sluggish Knight!&rdquo; he emptied his own at a draught.          &ldquo;&lsquo;Drink hael&rsquo;, Holy Clerk of Copmanhurst!&rdquo; answered the  warrior, and did his host reason in a similar brimmer.          &ldquo;Holy Clerk,&rdquo; said the stranger, after the first cup was thus  swallowed, &ldquo;I cannot but marvel that a man possessed of such thews and  sinews as thine, and who therewithal shows the talent of so goodly a  trencher-man, should think of abiding by himself in this wilderness. In my  judgment, you are fitter to keep a castle or a fort, eating of the fat and  drinking of the strong, than to live here upon pulse and water, or even upon  the charity of the keeper. At least, were I as thou, I should find myself both  disport and plenty out of the king&rsquo;s deer. There is many a goodly herd in  these forests, and a buck will never be missed that goes to the use of Saint  Dunstan&rsquo;s chaplain.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Sir Sluggish Knight,&rdquo; replied the Clerk, &ldquo;these are  dangerous words, and I pray you to forbear them. I am true hermit to the king  and law, and were I to spoil my liege&rsquo;s game, I should be sure of the  prison, and, an my gown saved me not, were in some peril of hanging.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nevertheless, were I as thou,&rdquo; said the knight, &ldquo;I would  take my walk by moonlight, when foresters and keepers were warm in bed, and  ever and anon,&mdash;as I pattered my prayers,&mdash;I would let fly a shaft  among the herds of dun deer that feed in the glades&mdash;Resolve me, Holy  Clerk, hast thou never practised such a pastime?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Friend Sluggard,&rdquo; answered the hermit, &ldquo;thou hast seen all  that can concern thee of my housekeeping, and something more than he deserves  who takes up his quarters by violence. Credit me, it is better to enjoy the  good which God sends thee, than to be impertinently curious how it comes. Fill  thy cup, and welcome; and do not, I pray thee, by further impertinent  enquiries, put me to show that thou couldst hardly have made good thy lodging  had I been earnest to oppose thee.&rdquo;          &ldquo;By my faith,&rdquo; said the knight, &ldquo;thou makest me more curious  than ever! Thou art the most mysterious hermit I ever met; and I will know more  of thee ere we part. As for thy threats, know, holy man, thou speakest to one  whose trade it is to find out danger wherever it is to be met with.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Sir Sluggish Knight, I drink to thee,&rdquo; said the hermit;  &ldquo;respecting thy valour much, but deeming wondrous slightly of thy  discretion. If thou wilt take equal arms with me, I will give thee, in all  friendship and brotherly love, such sufficing penance and complete absolution,  that thou shalt not for the next twelve months sin the sin of excess of  curiosity.&rdquo;          The knight pledged him, and desired him to name his weapons.          &ldquo;There is none,&rdquo; replied the hermit, &ldquo;from the scissors of  Delilah, and the tenpenny nail of Jael, to the scimitar of Goliath, at which I  am not a match for thee&mdash;But, if I am to make the election, what sayst  thou, good friend, to these trinkets?&rdquo;          Thus speaking, he opened another hutch, and took out from it a couple of  broadswords and bucklers, such as were used by the yeomanry of the period. The  knight, who watched his motions, observed that this second place of concealment  was furnished with two or three good long-bows, a cross-bow, a bundle of bolts  for the latter, and half-a-dozen sheaves of arrows for the former. A harp, and  other matters of a very uncanonical appearance, were also visible when this  dark recess was opened.          &ldquo;I promise thee, brother Clerk,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will ask thee no  more offensive questions. The contents of that cupboard are an answer to all my  enquiries; and I see a weapon there&rdquo; (here he stooped and took out the  harp) &ldquo;on which I would more gladly prove my skill with thee, than at the  sword and buckler.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I hope, Sir Knight,&rdquo; said the hermit, &ldquo;thou hast given no  good reason for thy surname of the Sluggard. I do promise thee I suspect thee  grievously. Nevertheless, thou art my guest, and I will not put thy manhood to  the proof without thine own free will. Sit thee down, then, and fill thy cup;  let us drink, sing, and be merry. If thou knowest ever a good lay, thou shalt  be welcome to a nook of pasty at Copmanhurst so long as I serve the chapel of  St Dunstan, which, please God, shall be till I change my grey covering for one  of green turf. But come, fill a flagon, for it will crave some time to tune the  harp; and nought pitches the voice and sharpens the ear like a cup of wine. For  my part, I love to feel the grape at my very finger-ends before they make the  harp-strings tinkle.&rdquo;   22                       CHAPTER XVII        At eve, within yon studious nook,   I ope my brass-embossed book,   Portray&rsquo;d with many a holy deed   Of martyrs crown&rsquo;d with heavenly meed;   Then, as my taper waxes dim,   Chant, ere I sleep, my measured hymn.               Who but would cast his pomp away,   To take my staff and amice grey,   And to the world&rsquo;s tumultuous stage,   Prefer the peaceful Hermitage?          W ARTON           Notwithstanding the prescription of the genial hermit, with which his guest  willingly complied, he found it no easy matter to bring the harp to harmony.          &ldquo;Methinks, holy father,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the instrument wants one  string, and the rest have been somewhat misused.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay, mark&rsquo;st thou that?&rdquo; replied the hermit; &ldquo;that  shows thee a master of the craft. Wine and wassail,&rdquo; he added, gravely  casting up his eyes&mdash;&ldquo;all the fault of wine and wassail!&mdash;I  told Allan-a-Dale, the northern minstrel, that he would damage the harp if he  touched it after the seventh cup, but he would not be controlled&mdash;Friend,  I drink to thy successful performance.&rdquo;          So saying, he took off his cup with much gravity, at the same time shaking his  head at the intemperance of the Scottish harper.          The knight in the meantime, had brought the strings into some order, and after  a short prelude, asked his host whether he would choose a  &ldquo;sirvente&rdquo; in the language of &ldquo;oc&rdquo;, or a  &ldquo;lai&rdquo; in the language of &ldquo;oui&rdquo;, or a  &ldquo;virelai&rdquo;, or a ballad in the vulgar English.   23            &ldquo;A ballad, a ballad,&rdquo; said the hermit, &ldquo;against all the  &lsquo;ocs&rsquo; and &lsquo;ouis&rsquo; of France. Downright English am I, Sir  Knight, and downright English was my patron St Dunstan, and scorned  &lsquo;oc&rsquo; and &lsquo;oui&rsquo;, as he would have scorned the parings of  the devil&rsquo;s hoof&mdash;downright English alone shall be sung in this  cell.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I will assay, then,&rdquo; said the knight, &ldquo;a ballad composed by  a Saxon glee-man, whom I knew in Holy Land.&rdquo;          It speedily appeared, that if the knight was not a complete master of the  minstrel art, his taste for it had at least been cultivated under the best  instructors. Art had taught him to soften the faults of a voice which had  little compass, and was naturally rough rather than mellow, and, in short, had  done all that culture can do in supplying natural deficiencies. His  performance, therefore, might have been termed very respectable by abler judges  than the hermit, especially as the knight threw into the notes now a degree of  spirit, and now of plaintive enthusiasm, which gave force and energy to the  verses which he sung.          THE CRUSADER&rsquo;S RETURN.      1.      High deeds achieved of knightly fame,   From Palestine the champion came;   The cross upon his shoulders borne,   Battle and blast had dimm&rsquo;d and torn.   Each dint upon his batter&rsquo;d shield   Was token of a foughten field;   And thus, beneath his lady&rsquo;s bower,   He sung as fell the twilight hour:&mdash;      2.      &ldquo;Joy to the fair!&mdash;thy knight behold,   Return&rsquo;d from yonder land of gold;   No wealth he brings, nor wealth can need,   Save his good arms and battle-steed   His spurs, to dash against a foe,   His lance and sword to lay him low;   Such all the trophies of his toil,   Such&mdash;and the hope of Tekla&rsquo;s smile!      3.      &ldquo;Joy to the fair! whose constant knight   Her favour fired to feats of might;   Unnoted shall she not remain,   Where meet the bright and noble train;   Minstrel shall sing and herald tell&mdash;   &lsquo;Mark yonder maid of beauty well,   &rsquo;Tis she for whose bright eyes were won   The listed field at Askalon!      4.      &ldquo;&lsquo;Note well her smile!&mdash;it edged the blade   Which fifty wives to widows made,   When, vain his strength and Mahound&rsquo;s spell,   Iconium&rsquo;s turban&rsquo;d Soldan fell.   Seest thou her locks, whose sunny glow   Half shows, half shades, her neck of snow?   Twines not of them one golden thread,   But for its sake a Paynim bled.&rsquo;      5.      &ldquo;Joy to the fair!&mdash;my name unknown,   Each deed, and all its praise thine own   Then, oh! unbar this churlish gate,   The night dew falls, the hour is late.   Inured to Syria&rsquo;s glowing breath,   I feel the north breeze chill as death;   Let grateful love quell maiden shame,   And grant him bliss who brings thee fame.&rdquo;          During this performance, the hermit demeaned himself much like a first-rate  critic of the present day at a new opera. He reclined back upon his seat, with  his eyes half shut; now, folding his hands and twisting his thumbs, he seemed  absorbed in attention, and anon, balancing his expanded palms, he gently  flourished them in time to the music. At one or two favourite cadences, he  threw in a little assistance of his own, where the knight&rsquo;s voice seemed  unable to carry the air so high as his worshipful taste approved. When the song  was ended, the anchorite emphatically declared it a good one, and well sung.          &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I think my Saxon countrymen had herded  long enough with the Normans, to fall into the tone of their melancholy  ditties. What took the honest knight from home? or what could he expect but to  find his mistress agreeably engaged with a rival on his return, and his  serenade, as they call it, as little regarded as the caterwauling of a cat in  the gutter? Nevertheless, Sir Knight, I drink this cup to thee, to the success  of all true lovers&mdash;I fear you are none,&rdquo; he added, on observing  that the knight (whose brain began to be heated with these repeated draughts)  qualified his flagon from the water pitcher.          &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the knight, &ldquo;did you not tell me that this water  was from the well of your blessed patron, St Dunstan?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay, truly,&rdquo; said the hermit, &ldquo;and many a hundred of pagans  did he baptize there, but I never heard that he drank any of it. Every thing  should be put to its proper use in this world. St Dunstan knew, as well as any  one, the prerogatives of a jovial friar.&rdquo;          And so saying, he reached the harp, and entertained his guest with the  following characteristic song, to a sort of derry-down chorus, appropriate to  an old English ditty.   24                     THE BAREFOOTED FRIAR.      1.      I&rsquo;ll give thee, good fellow, a twelvemonth or twain,   To search Europe through, from Byzantium to Spain;   But ne&rsquo;er shall you find, should you search till you tire,   So happy a man as the Barefooted Friar.      2.      Your knight for his lady pricks forth in career,   And is brought home at even-song prick&rsquo;d through with a spear;   I confess him in haste&mdash;for his lady desires   No comfort on earth save the Barefooted Friar&rsquo;s.      3.      Your monarch?&mdash;Pshaw! many a prince has been known   To barter his robes for our cowl and our gown,   But which of us e&rsquo;er felt the idle desire   To exchange for a crown the grey hood of a Friar!      4.      The Friar has walk&rsquo;d out, and where&rsquo;er he has gone,   The land and its fatness is mark&rsquo;d for his own;   He can roam where he lists, he can stop when he tires,   For every man&rsquo;s house is the Barefooted Friar&rsquo;s.      5.      He&rsquo;s expected at noon, and no wight till he comes   May profane the great chair, or the porridge of plums   For the best of the cheer, and the seat by the fire,   Is the undenied right of the Barefooted Friar.      6.      He&rsquo;s expected at night, and the pasty&rsquo;s made hot,   They broach the brown ale, and they fill the black pot,   And the goodwife would wish the goodman in the mire,   Ere he lack&rsquo;d a soft pillow, the Barefooted Friar.      7.      Long flourish the sandal, the cord, and the cope,   The dread of the devil and trust of the Pope;   For to gather life&rsquo;s roses, unscathed by the briar,   Is granted alone to the Barefooted Friar.          &ldquo;By my troth,&rdquo; said the knight, &ldquo;thou hast sung well and  lustily, and in high praise of thine order. And, talking of the devil, Holy  Clerk, are you not afraid that he may pay you a visit during some of your  uncanonical pastimes?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I uncanonical!&rdquo; answered the hermit; &ldquo;I scorn the  charge&mdash;I scorn it with my heels!&mdash;I serve the duty of my chapel duly  and truly&mdash;Two masses daily, morning and evening, primes, noons, and  vespers, &lsquo;aves, credos, paters&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;          &ldquo;Excepting moonlight nights, when the venison is in season,&rdquo; said  his guest.          &ldquo;&lsquo;Exceptis excipiendis&rsquo;&rdquo; replied the hermit, &ldquo;as  our old abbot taught me to say, when impertinent laymen should ask me if I kept  every punctilio of mine order.&rdquo;          &ldquo;True, holy father,&rdquo; said the knight; &ldquo;but the devil is apt  to keep an eye on such exceptions; he goes about, thou knowest, like a roaring  lion.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Let him roar here if he dares,&rdquo; said the friar; &ldquo;a touch of  my cord will make him roar as loud as the tongs of St Dunstan himself did. I  never feared man, and I as little fear the devil and his imps. Saint Dunstan,  Saint Dubric, Saint Winibald, Saint Winifred, Saint Swibert, Saint Willick, not  forgetting Saint Thomas a Kent, and my own poor merits to speed, I defy every  devil of them, come cut and long tail.&mdash;But to let you into a secret, I  never speak upon such subjects, my friend, until after morning vespers.&rdquo;          He changed the conversation; fast and furious grew the mirth of the parties,  and many a song was exchanged betwixt them, when their revels were interrupted  by a loud knocking at the door of the hermitage.          The occasion of this interruption we can only explain by resuming the  adventures of another set of our characters; for, like old Ariosto, we do not  pique ourselves upon continuing uniformly to keep company with any one  personage of our drama.                     CHAPTER XVIII        Away! our journey lies through dell and dingle,   Where the blithe fawn trips by its timid mother,   Where the broad oak, with intercepting boughs,   Chequers the sunbeam in the green-sward alley&mdash;   Up and away!&mdash;for lovely paths are these   To tread, when the glad Sun is on his throne   Less pleasant, and less safe, when Cynthia&rsquo;s lamp   With doubtful glimmer lights the dreary forest.          E TTRICK  F OREST           When Cedric the Saxon saw his son drop down senseless in the lists at Ashby,  his first impulse was to order him into the custody and care of his own  attendants, but the words choked in his throat. He could not bring himself to  acknowledge, in presence of such an assembly, the son whom he had renounced and  disinherited. He ordered, however, Oswald to keep an eye upon him; and directed  that officer, with two of his serfs, to convey Ivanhoe to Ashby as soon as the  crowd had dispersed. Oswald, however, was anticipated in this good office. The  crowd dispersed, indeed, but the knight was nowhere to be seen.          It was in vain that Cedric&rsquo;s cupbearer looked around for his young  master&mdash;he saw the bloody spot on which he had lately sunk down, but  himself he saw no longer; it seemed as if the fairies had conveyed him from the  spot. Perhaps Oswald (for the Saxons were very superstitious) might have  adopted some such hypothesis, to account for Ivanhoe&rsquo;s disappearance, had  he not suddenly cast his eye upon a person attired like a squire, in whom he  recognised the features of his fellow-servant Gurth. Anxious concerning his  master&rsquo;s fate, and in despair at his sudden disappearance, the translated  swineherd was searching for him everywhere, and had neglected, in doing so, the  concealment on which his own safety depended. Oswald deemed it his duty to  secure Gurth, as a fugitive of whose fate his master was to judge.          Renewing his enquiries concerning the fate of Ivanhoe, the only information  which the cupbearer could collect from the bystanders was, that the knight had  been raised with care by certain well-attired grooms, and placed in a litter  belonging to a lady among the spectators, which had immediately transported him  out of the press. Oswald, on receiving this intelligence, resolved to return to  his master for farther instructions, carrying along with him Gurth, whom he  considered in some sort as a deserter from the service of Cedric.          The Saxon had been under very intense and agonizing apprehensions concerning  his son; for Nature had asserted her rights, in spite of the patriotic stoicism  which laboured to disown her. But no sooner was he informed that Ivanhoe was in  careful, and probably in friendly hands, than the paternal anxiety which had  been excited by the dubiety of his fate, gave way anew to the feeling of  injured pride and resentment, at what he termed Wilfred&rsquo;s filial  disobedience.          &ldquo;Let him wander his way,&rdquo; said he&mdash;&ldquo;let those leech his  wounds for whose sake he encountered them. He is fitter to do the juggling  tricks of the Norman chivalry than to maintain the fame and honour of his  English ancestry with the glaive and brown-bill, the good old weapons of his  country.&rdquo;          &ldquo;If to maintain the honour of ancestry,&rdquo; said Rowena, who was  present, &ldquo;it is sufficient to be wise in council and brave in  execution&mdash;to be boldest among the bold, and gentlest among the gentle, I  know no voice, save his father&rsquo;s&mdash;-&rdquo;          &ldquo;Be silent, Lady Rowena!&mdash;on this subject only I hear you not.  Prepare yourself for the Prince&rsquo;s festival: we have been summoned thither  with unwonted circumstance of honour and of courtesy, such as the haughty  Normans have rarely used to our race since the fatal day of Hastings. Thither  will I go, were it only to show these proud Normans how little the fate of a  son, who could defeat their bravest, can affect a Saxon.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thither,&rdquo; said Rowena, &ldquo;do I NOT go; and I pray you to  beware, lest what you mean for courage and constancy, shall be accounted  hardness of heart.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Remain at home, then, ungrateful lady,&rdquo; answered Cedric;  &ldquo;thine is the hard heart, which can sacrifice the weal of an oppressed  people to an idle and unauthorized attachment. I seek the noble Athelstane, and  with him attend the banquet of John of Anjou.&rdquo;          He went accordingly to the banquet, of which we have already mentioned the  principal events. Immediately upon retiring from the castle, the Saxon thanes,  with their attendants, took horse; and it was during the bustle which attended  their doing so, that Cedric, for the first time, cast his eyes upon the  deserter Gurth. The noble Saxon had returned from the banquet, as we have seen,  in no very placid humour, and wanted but a pretext for wreaking his anger upon  some one.          &ldquo;The gyves!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the  gyves!&mdash;Oswald&mdash;Hundibert!&mdash;Dogs and villains!&mdash;why leave  ye the knave unfettered?&rdquo;          Without daring to remonstrate, the companions of Gurth bound him with a halter,  as the readiest cord which occurred. He submitted to the operation without  remonstrance, except that, darting a reproachful look at his master, he said,  &ldquo;This comes of loving your flesh and blood better than mine own.&rdquo;          &ldquo;To horse, and forward!&rdquo; said Cedric.          &ldquo;It is indeed full time,&rdquo; said the noble Athelstane; &ldquo;for, if  we ride not the faster, the worthy Abbot Waltheoff&rsquo;s preparations for a  rere-supper   25   will be altogether spoiled.&rdquo;          The travellers, however, used such speed as to reach the convent of St  Withold&rsquo;s before the apprehended evil took place. The Abbot, himself of  ancient Saxon descent, received the noble Saxons with the profuse and exuberant  hospitality of their nation, wherein they indulged to a late, or rather an  early hour; nor did they take leave of their reverend host the next morning  until they had shared with him a sumptuous refection.          As the cavalcade left the court of the monastery, an incident happened somewhat  alarming to the Saxons, who, of all people of Europe, were most addicted to a  superstitious observance of omens, and to whose opinions can be traced most of  those notions upon such subjects, still to be found among our popular  antiquities. For the Normans being a mixed race, and better informed according  to the information of the times, had lost most of the superstitious prejudices  which their ancestors had brought from Scandinavia, and piqued themselves upon  thinking freely on such topics.          In the present instance, the apprehension of impending evil was inspired by no  less respectable a prophet than a large lean black dog, which, sitting upright,  howled most piteously as the foremost riders left the gate, and presently  afterwards, barking wildly, and jumping to and fro, seemed bent upon attaching  itself to the party.          &ldquo;I like not that music, father Cedric,&rdquo; said Athelstane; for by  this title of respect he was accustomed to address him.          &ldquo;Nor I either, uncle,&rdquo; said Wamba; &ldquo;I greatly fear we shall  have to pay the piper.&rdquo;          &ldquo;In my mind,&rdquo; said Athelstane, upon whose memory the Abbot&rsquo;s  good ale (for Burton was already famous for that genial liquor) had made a  favourable impression,&mdash;&ldquo;in my mind we had better turn back, and  abide with the Abbot until the afternoon. It is unlucky to travel where your  path is crossed by a monk, a hare, or a howling dog, until you have eaten your  next meal.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Away!&rdquo; said Cedric, impatiently; &ldquo;the day is already too  short for our journey. For the dog, I know it to be the cur of the runaway  slave Gurth, a useless fugitive like its master.&rdquo;          So saying, and rising at the same time in his stirrups, impatient at the  interruption of his journey, he launched his javelin at poor Fangs&mdash;for  Fangs it was, who, having traced his master thus far upon his stolen  expedition, had here lost him, and was now, in his uncouth way, rejoicing at  his reappearance. The javelin inflicted a wound upon the animal&rsquo;s  shoulder, and narrowly missed pinning him to the earth; and Fangs fled howling  from the presence of the enraged thane. Gurth&rsquo;s heart swelled within him;  for he felt this meditated slaughter of his faithful adherent in a degree much  deeper than the harsh treatment he had himself received. Having in vain  attempted to raise his hand to his eyes, he said to Wamba, who, seeing his  master&rsquo;s ill humour had prudently retreated to the rear, &ldquo;I pray  thee, do me the kindness to wipe my eyes with the skirt of thy mantle; the dust  offends me, and these bonds will not let me help myself one way or  another.&rdquo;          Wamba did him the service he required, and they rode side by side for some  time, during which Gurth maintained a moody silence. At length he could repress  his feelings no longer.          &ldquo;Friend Wamba,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;of all those who are fools enough  to serve Cedric, thou alone hast dexterity enough to make thy folly acceptable  to him. Go to him, therefore, and tell him that neither for love nor fear will  Gurth serve him longer. He may strike the head from me&mdash;he may scourge  me&mdash;he may load me with irons&mdash;but henceforth he shall never compel  me either to love or to obey him. Go to him, then, and tell him that Gurth the  son of Beowulph renounces his service.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Assuredly,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;fool as I am, I shall not do your  fool&rsquo;s errand. Cedric hath another javelin stuck into his girdle, and  thou knowest he does not always miss his mark.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I care not,&rdquo; replied Gurth, &ldquo;how soon he makes a mark of me.  Yesterday he left Wilfred, my young master, in his blood. To-day he has striven  to kill before my face the only other living creature that ever showed me  kindness. By St Edmund, St Dunstan, St Withold, St Edward the Confessor, and  every other Saxon saint in the calendar,&rdquo; (for Cedric never swore by any  that was not of Saxon lineage, and all his household had the same limited  devotion,) &ldquo;I will never forgive him!&rdquo;          &ldquo;To my thinking now,&rdquo; said the Jester, who was frequently wont to  act as peace-maker in the family, &ldquo;our master did not propose to hurt  Fangs, but only to affright him. For, if you observed, he rose in his stirrups,  as thereby meaning to overcast the mark; and so he would have done, but Fangs  happening to bound up at the very moment, received a scratch, which I will be  bound to heal with a penny&rsquo;s breadth of tar.&rdquo;          &ldquo;If I thought so,&rdquo; said Gurth&mdash;&ldquo;if I could but think  so&mdash;but no&mdash;I saw the javelin was well aimed&mdash;I heard it whizz  through the air with all the wrathful malevolence of him who cast it, and it  quivered after it had pitched in the ground, as if with regret for having  missed its mark. By the hog dear to St Anthony, I renounce him!&rdquo;          And the indignant swineherd resumed his sullen silence, which no efforts of the  Jester could again induce him to break.          Meanwhile Cedric and Athelstane, the leaders of the troop, conversed together  on the state of the land, on the dissensions of the royal family, on the feuds  and quarrels among the Norman nobles, and on the chance which there was that  the oppressed Saxons might be able to free themselves from the yoke of the  Normans, or at least to elevate themselves into national consequence and  independence, during the civil convulsions which were likely to ensue. On this  subject Cedric was all animation. The restoration of the independence of his  race was the idol of his heart, to which he had willingly sacrificed domestic  happiness and the interests of his own son. But, in order to achieve this great  revolution in favour of the native English, it was necessary that they should  be united among themselves, and act under an acknowledged head. The necessity  of choosing their chief from the Saxon blood-royal was not only evident in  itself, but had been made a solemn condition by those whom Cedric had intrusted  with his secret plans and hopes. Athelstane had this quality at least; and  though he had few mental accomplishments or talents to recommend him as a  leader, he had still a goodly person, was no coward, had been accustomed to  martial exercises, and seemed willing to defer to the advice of counsellors  more wise than himself. Above all, he was known to be liberal and hospitable,  and believed to be good-natured. But whatever pretensions Athelstane had to be  considered as head of the Saxon confederacy, many of that nation were disposed  to prefer to the title of the Lady Rowena, who drew her descent from Alfred,  and whose father having been a chief renowned for wisdom, courage, and  generosity, his memory was highly honoured by his oppressed countrymen.          It would have been no difficult thing for Cedric, had he been so disposed, to  have placed himself at the head of a third party, as formidable at least as any  of the others. To counterbalance their royal descent, he had courage, activity,  energy, and, above all, that devoted attachment to the cause which had procured  him the epithet of The Saxon, and his birth was inferior to none, excepting  only that of Athelstane and his ward. These qualities, however, were unalloyed  by the slightest shade of selfishness; and, instead of dividing yet farther his  weakened nation by forming a faction of his own, it was a leading part of  Cedric&rsquo;s plan to extinguish that which already existed, by promoting a  marriage betwixt Rowena and Athelstane. An obstacle occurred to this his  favourite project, in the mutual attachment of his ward and his son and hence  the original cause of the banishment of Wilfred from the house of his father.          This stern measure Cedric had adopted, in hopes that, during Wilfred&rsquo;s  absence, Rowena might relinquish her preference, but in this hope he was  disappointed; a disappointment which might be attributed in part to the mode in  which his ward had been educated. Cedric, to whom the name of Alfred was as  that of a deity, had treated the sole remaining scion of that great monarch  with a degree of observance, such as, perhaps, was in those days scarce paid to  an acknowledged princess. Rowena&rsquo;s will had been in almost all cases a  law to his household; and Cedric himself, as if determined that her sovereignty  should be fully acknowledged within that little circle at least, seemed to take  a pride in acting as the first of her subjects. Thus trained in the exercise  not only of free will, but despotic authority, Rowena was, by her previous  education, disposed both to resist and to resent any attempt to control her  affections, or dispose of her hand contrary to her inclinations, and to assert  her independence in a case in which even those females who have been trained up  to obedience and subjection, are not infrequently apt to dispute the authority  of guardians and parents. The opinions which she felt strongly, she avowed  boldly; and Cedric, who could not free himself from his habitual deference to  her opinions, felt totally at a loss how to enforce his authority of guardian.          It was in vain that he attempted to dazzle her with the prospect of a visionary  throne. Rowena, who possessed strong sense, neither considered his plan as  practicable, nor as desirable, so far as she was concerned, could it have been  achieved. Without attempting to conceal her avowed preference of Wilfred of  Ivanhoe, she declared that, were that favoured knight out of question, she  would rather take refuge in a convent, than share a throne with Athelstane,  whom, having always despised, she now began, on account of the trouble she  received on his account, thoroughly to detest.          Nevertheless, Cedric, whose opinions of women&rsquo;s constancy was far from  strong, persisted in using every means in his power to bring about the proposed  match, in which he conceived he was rendering an important service to the Saxon  cause. The sudden and romantic appearance of his son in the lists at Ashby, he  had justly regarded as almost a death&rsquo;s blow to his hopes. His paternal  affection, it is true, had for an instant gained the victory over pride and  patriotism; but both had returned in full force, and under their joint  operation, he was now bent upon making a determined effort for the union of  Athelstane and Rowena, together with expediting those other measures which  seemed necessary to forward the restoration of Saxon independence.          On this last subject, he was now labouring with Athelstane, not without having  reason, every now and then, to lament, like Hotspur, that he should have moved  such a dish of skimmed milk to so honourable an action. Athelstane, it is true,  was vain enough, and loved to have his ears tickled with tales of his high  descent, and of his right by inheritance to homage and sovereignty. But his  petty vanity was sufficiently gratified by receiving this homage at the hands  of his immediate attendants, and of the Saxons who approached him. If he had  the courage to encounter danger, he at least hated the trouble of going to seek  it; and while he agreed in the general principles laid down by Cedric  concerning the claim of the Saxons to independence, and was still more easily  convinced of his own title to reign over them when that independence should be  attained, yet when the means of asserting these rights came to be discussed, he  was still &ldquo;Athelstane the Unready,&rdquo; slow, irresolute,  procrastinating, and unenterprising. The warm and impassioned exhortations of  Cedric had as little effect upon his impassive temper, as red-hot balls  alighting in the water, which produce a little sound and smoke, and are  instantly extinguished.          If, leaving this task, which might be compared to spurring a tired jade, or to  hammering upon cold iron, Cedric fell back to his ward Rowena, he received  little more satisfaction from conferring with her. For, as his presence  interrupted the discourse between the lady and her favourite attendant upon the  gallantry and fate of Wilfred, Elgitha failed not to revenge both her mistress  and herself, by recurring to the overthrow of Athelstane in the lists, the most  disagreeable subject which could greet the ears of Cedric. To this sturdy  Saxon, therefore, the day&rsquo;s journey was fraught with all manner of  displeasure and discomfort; so that he more than once internally cursed the  tournament, and him who had proclaimed it, together with his own folly in ever  thinking of going thither.          At noon, upon the motion of Athelstane, the travellers paused in a woodland  shade by a fountain, to repose their horses and partake of some provisions,  with which the hospitable Abbot had loaded a sumpter mule. Their repast was a  pretty long one; and these several interruptions rendered it impossible for  them to hope to reach Rotherwood without travelling all night, a conviction  which induced them to proceed on their way at a more hasty pace than they had  hitherto used.                     CHAPTER XIX        A train of armed men, some noble dame   Escorting, (so their scatter&rsquo;d words discover&rsquo;d,   As unperceived I hung upon their rear,)   Are close at hand, and mean to pass the night   Within the castle.          O RRA, A  T RAGEDY           The travellers had now reached the verge of the wooded country, and were about  to plunge into its recesses, held dangerous at that time from the number of  outlaws whom oppression and poverty had driven to despair, and who occupied the  forests in such large bands as could easily bid defiance to the feeble police  of the period. From these rovers, however, notwithstanding the lateness of the  hour Cedric and Athelstane accounted themselves secure, as they had in  attendance ten servants, besides Wamba and Gurth, whose aid could not be  counted upon, the one being a jester and the other a captive. It may be added,  that in travelling thus late through the forest, Cedric and Athelstane relied  on their descent and character, as well as their courage. The outlaws, whom the  severity of the forest laws had reduced to this roving and desperate mode of  life, were chiefly peasants and yeomen of Saxon descent, and were generally  supposed to respect the persons and property of their countrymen.          As the travellers journeyed on their way, they were alarmed by repeated cries  for assistance; and when they rode up to the place from whence they came, they  were surprised to find a horse-litter placed upon the ground, beside which sat  a young woman, richly dressed in the Jewish fashion, while an old man, whose  yellow cap proclaimed him to belong to the same nation, walked up and down with  gestures expressive of the deepest despair, and wrung his hands, as if affected  by some strange disaster.          To the enquiries of Athelstane and Cedric, the old Jew could for some time only  answer by invoking the protection of all the patriarchs of the Old Testament  successively against the sons of Ishmael, who were coming to smite them, hip  and thigh, with the edge of the sword. When he began to come to himself out of  this agony of terror, Isaac of York (for it was our old friend) was at length  able to explain, that he had hired a body-guard of six men at Ashby, together  with mules for carrying the litter of a sick friend. This party had undertaken  to escort him as far as Doncaster. They had come thus far in safety; but having  received information from a wood-cutter that there was a strong band of outlaws  lying in wait in the woods before them, Isaac&rsquo;s mercenaries had not only  taken flight, but had carried off with them the horses which bore the litter  and left the Jew and his daughter without the means either of defence or of  retreat, to be plundered, and probably murdered, by the banditti, who they  expected every moment would bring down upon them. &ldquo;Would it but please  your valours,&rdquo; added Isaac, in a tone of deep humiliation, &ldquo;to  permit the poor Jews to travel under your safeguard, I swear by the tables of  our law, that never has favour been conferred upon a child of Israel since the  days of our captivity, which shall be more gratefully acknowledged.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Dog of a Jew!&rdquo; said Athelstane, whose memory was of that petty  kind which stores up trifles of all kinds, but particularly trifling offences,  &ldquo;dost not remember how thou didst beard us in the gallery at the  tilt-yard? Fight or flee, or compound with the outlaws as thou dost list, ask  neither aid nor company from us; and if they rob only such as thee, who rob all  the world, I, for mine own share, shall hold them right honest folk.&rdquo;          Cedric did not assent to the severe proposal of his companion. &ldquo;We shall  do better,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to leave them two of our attendants and two  horses to convey them back to the next village. It will diminish our strength  but little; and with your good sword, noble Athelstane, and the aid of those  who remain, it will be light work for us to face twenty of those  runagates.&rdquo;          Rowena, somewhat alarmed by the mention of outlaws in force, and so near them,  strongly seconded the proposal of her guardian. But Rebecca suddenly quitting  her dejected posture, and making her way through the attendants to the palfrey  of the Saxon lady, knelt down, and, after the Oriental fashion in addressing  superiors, kissed the hem of Rowena&rsquo;s garment. Then rising, and throwing  back her veil, she implored her in the great name of the God whom they both  worshipped, and by that revelation of the Law upon Mount Sinai, in which they  both believed, that she would have compassion upon them, and suffer them to go  forward under their safeguard. &ldquo;It is not for myself that I pray this  favour,&rdquo; said Rebecca; &ldquo;nor is it even for that poor old man. I  know that to wrong and to spoil our nation is a light fault, if not a merit,  with the Christians; and what is it to us whether it be done in the city, in  the desert, or in the field? But it is in the name of one dear to many, and  dear even to you, that I beseech you to let this sick person be transported  with care and tenderness under your protection. For, if evil chance him, the  last moment of your life would be embittered with regret for denying that which  I ask of you.&rdquo;          The noble and solemn air with which Rebecca made this appeal, gave it double  weight with the fair Saxon.          &ldquo;The man is old and feeble,&rdquo; she said to her guardian, &ldquo;the  maiden young and beautiful, their friend sick and in peril of his  life&mdash;Jews though they be, we cannot as Christians leave them in this  extremity. Let them unload two of the sumpter-mules, and put the baggage behind  two of the serfs. The mules may transport the litter, and we have led horses  for the old man and his daughter.&rdquo;          Cedric readily assented to what she proposed, and Athelstane only added the  condition, &ldquo;that they should travel in the rear of the whole party, where  Wamba,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;might attend them with his shield of boar&rsquo;s  brawn.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I have left my shield in the tilt-yard,&rdquo; answered the Jester,  &ldquo;as has been the fate of many a better knight than myself.&rdquo;          Athelstane coloured deeply, for such had been his own fate on the last day of  the tournament; while Rowena, who was pleased in the same proportion, as if to  make amends for the brutal jest of her unfeeling suitor, requested Rebecca to  ride by her side.          &ldquo;It were not fit I should do so,&rdquo; answered Rebecca, with proud  humility, &ldquo;where my society might be held a disgrace to my  protectress.&rdquo;          By this time the change of baggage was hastily achieved; for the single word  &ldquo;outlaws&rdquo; rendered every one sufficiently alert, and the approach  of twilight made the sound yet more impressive. Amid the bustle, Gurth was  taken from horseback, in the course of which removal he prevailed upon the  Jester to slack the cord with which his arms were bound. It was so negligently  refastened, perhaps intentionally, on the part of Wamba, that Gurth found no  difficulty in freeing his arms altogether from bondage, and then, gliding into  the thicket, he made his escape from the party.          The bustle had been considerable, and it was some time before Gurth was missed;  for, as he was to be placed for the rest of the journey behind a servant, every  one supposed that some other of his companions had him under his custody, and  when it began to be whispered among them that Gurth had actually disappeared,  they were under such immediate expectation of an attack from the outlaws, that  it was not held convenient to pay much attention to the circumstance.          The path upon which the party travelled was now so narrow, as not to admit,  with any sort of convenience, above two riders abreast, and began to descend  into a dingle, traversed by a brook whose banks were broken, swampy, and  overgrown with dwarf willows. Cedric and Athelstane, who were at the head of  their retinue, saw the risk of being attacked at this pass; but neither of them  having had much practice in war, no better mode of preventing the danger  occurred to them than that they should hasten through the defile as fast as  possible. Advancing, therefore, without much order, they had just crossed the  brook with a part of their followers, when they were assailed in front, flank,  and rear at once, with an impetuosity to which, in their confused and  ill-prepared condition, it was impossible to offer effectual resistance. The  shout of &ldquo;A white dragon!&mdash;a white dragon!&mdash;Saint George for  merry England!&rdquo; war-cries adopted by the assailants, as belonging to  their assumed character of Saxon outlaws, was heard on every side, and on every  side enemies appeared with a rapidity of advance and attack which seemed to  multiply their numbers.          Both the Saxon chiefs were made prisoners at the same moment, and each under  circumstances expressive of his character. Cedric, the instant that an enemy  appeared, launched at him his remaining javelin, which, taking better effect  than that which he had hurled at Fangs, nailed the man against an oak-tree that  happened to be close behind him. Thus far successful, Cedric spurred his horse  against a second, drawing his sword at the same time, and striking with such  inconsiderate fury, that his weapon encountered a thick branch which hung over  him, and he was disarmed by the violence of his own blow. He was instantly made  prisoner, and pulled from his horse by two or three of the banditti who crowded  around him. Athelstane shared his captivity, his bridle having been seized, and  he himself forcibly dismounted, long before he could draw his weapon, or assume  any posture of effectual defence.          The attendants, embarrassed with baggage, surprised and terrified at the fate  of their masters, fell an easy prey to the assailants; while the Lady Rowena,  in the centre of the cavalcade, and the Jew and his daughter in the rear,  experienced the same misfortune.          Of all the train none escaped except Wamba, who showed upon the occasion much  more courage than those who pretended to greater sense. He possessed himself of  a sword belonging to one of the domestics, who was just drawing it with a tardy  and irresolute hand, laid it about him like a lion, drove back several who  approached him, and made a brave though ineffectual attempt to succour his  master. Finding himself overpowered, the Jester at length threw himself from  his horse, plunged into the thicket, and, favoured by the general confusion,  escaped from the scene of action. Yet the valiant Jester, as soon as he found  himself safe, hesitated more than once whether he should not turn back and  share the captivity of a master to whom he was sincerely attached.          &ldquo;I have heard men talk of the blessings of freedom,&rdquo; he said to  himself, &ldquo;but I wish any wise man would teach me what use to make of it  now that I have it.&rdquo;          As he pronounced these words aloud, a voice very near him called out in a low  and cautious tone, &ldquo;Wamba!&rdquo; and, at the same time, a dog, which he  recognised to be Fangs, jumped up and fawned upon him. &ldquo;Gurth!&rdquo;  answered Wamba, with the same caution, and the swineherd immediately stood  before him.          &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; said he eagerly; &ldquo;what mean these  cries, and that clashing of swords?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Only a trick of the times,&rdquo; said Wamba; &ldquo;they are all  prisoners.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Who are prisoners?&rdquo; exclaimed Gurth, impatiently.          &ldquo;My lord, and my lady, and Athelstane, and Hundibert, and Oswald.&rdquo;          &ldquo;In the name of God!&rdquo; said Gurth, &ldquo;how came they  prisoners?&mdash;and to whom?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Our master was too ready to fight,&rdquo; said the Jester; &ldquo;and  Athelstane was not ready enough, and no other person was ready at all. And they  are prisoners to green cassocks, and black visors. And they lie all tumbled  about on the green, like the crab-apples that you shake down to your swine. And  I would laugh at it,&rdquo; said the honest Jester, &ldquo;if I could for  weeping.&rdquo; And he shed tears of unfeigned sorrow.          Gurth&rsquo;s countenance kindled&mdash;&ldquo;Wamba,&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;thou hast a weapon, and thy heart was ever stronger than thy  brain,&mdash;we are only two&mdash;but a sudden attack from men of resolution  will do much&mdash;follow me!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Whither?&mdash;and for what purpose?&rdquo; said the Jester.          &ldquo;To rescue Cedric.&rdquo;          &ldquo;But you have renounced his service but now,&rdquo; said Wamba.          &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Gurth, &ldquo;was but while he was  fortunate&mdash;follow me!&rdquo;          As the Jester was about to obey, a third person suddenly made his appearance,  and commanded them both to halt. From his dress and arms, Wamba would have  conjectured him to be one of those outlaws who had just assailed his master;  but, besides that he wore no mask, the glittering baldric across his shoulder,  with the rich bugle-horn which it supported, as well as the calm and commanding  expression of his voice and manner, made him, notwithstanding the twilight,  recognise Locksley the yeoman, who had been victorious, under such  disadvantageous circumstances, in the contest for the prize of archery.          &ldquo;What is the meaning of all this,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;or who is it  that rifle, and ransom, and make prisoners, in these forests?&rdquo;          &ldquo;You may look at their cassocks close by,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;and  see whether they be thy children&rsquo;s coats or no&mdash;for they are as like  thine own, as one green pea-cod is to another.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I will learn that presently,&rdquo; answered Locksley; &ldquo;and I  charge ye, on peril of your lives, not to stir from the place where ye stand,  until I have returned. Obey me, and it shall be the better for you and your  masters.&mdash;Yet stay, I must render myself as like these men as  possible.&rdquo;          So saying he unbuckled his baldric with the bugle, took a feather from his cap,  and gave them to Wamba; then drew a vizard from his pouch, and, repeating his  charges to them to stand fast, went to execute his purposes of reconnoitring.          &ldquo;Shall we stand fast, Gurth?&rdquo; said Wamba; &ldquo;or shall we  e&rsquo;en give him leg-bail? In my foolish mind, he had all the equipage of a  thief too much in readiness, to be himself a true man.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Let him be the devil,&rdquo; said Gurth, &ldquo;an he will. We can be no  worse of waiting his return. If he belong to that party, he must already have  given them the alarm, and it will avail nothing either to fight or fly.  Besides, I have late experience, that errant thieves are not the worst men in  the world to have to deal with.&rdquo;          The yeoman returned in the course of a few minutes.          &ldquo;Friend Gurth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have mingled among yon men, and  have learnt to whom they belong, and whither they are bound. There is, I think,  no chance that they will proceed to any actual violence against their  prisoners. For three men to attempt them at this moment, were little else than  madness; for they are good men of war, and have, as such, placed sentinels to  give the alarm when any one approaches. But I trust soon to gather such a  force, as may act in defiance of all their precautions; you are both servants,  and, as I think, faithful servants, of Cedric the Saxon, the friend of the  rights of Englishmen. He shall not want English hands to help him in this  extremity. Come then with me, until I gather more aid.&rdquo;          So saying, he walked through the wood at a great pace, followed by the jester  and the swineherd. It was not consistent with Wamba&rsquo;s humour to travel  long in silence.          &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said he, looking at the baldric and bugle which he still  carried, &ldquo;that I saw the arrow shot which won this gay prize, and that  not so long since as Christmas.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Gurth, &ldquo;could take it on my halidome, that I  have heard the voice of the good yeoman who won it, by night as well as by day,  and that the moon is not three days older since I did so.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Mine honest friends,&rdquo; replied the yeoman, &ldquo;who, or what I  am, is little to the present purpose; should I free your master, you will have  reason to think me the best friend you have ever had in your lives. And whether  I am known by one name or another&mdash;or whether I can draw a bow as well or  better than a cow-keeper, or whether it is my pleasure to walk in sunshine or  by moonlight, are matters, which, as they do not concern you, so neither need  ye busy yourselves respecting them.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Our heads are in the lion&rsquo;s mouth,&rdquo; said Wamba, in a whisper  to Gurth, &ldquo;get them out how we can.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Hush&mdash;be silent,&rdquo; said Gurth. &ldquo;Offend him not by thy  folly, and I trust sincerely that all will go well.&rdquo;                     CHAPTER XX        When autumn nights were long and drear,       And forest walks were dark and dim,   How sweetly on the pilgrim&rsquo;s ear       Was wont to steal the hermit&rsquo;s hymn      Devotion borrows Music&rsquo;s tone,       And Music took Devotion&rsquo;s wing;   And, like the bird that hails the sun,       They soar to heaven, and soaring sing.          T HE  H ERMIT OF  S T  C LEMENT&rsquo;S  W ELL           It was after three hours&rsquo; good walking that the servants of Cedric, with  their mysterious guide, arrived at a small opening in the forest, in the centre  of which grew an oak-tree of enormous magnitude, throwing its twisted branches  in every direction. Beneath this tree four or five yeomen lay stretched on the  ground, while another, as sentinel, walked to and fro in the moonlight shade.          Upon hearing the sound of feet approaching, the watch instantly gave the alarm,  and the sleepers as suddenly started up and bent their bows. Six arrows placed  on the string were pointed towards the quarter from which the travellers  approached, when their guide, being recognised, was welcomed with every token  of respect and attachment, and all signs and fears of a rough reception at once  subsided.          &ldquo;Where is the Miller?&rdquo; was his first question.          &ldquo;On the road towards Rotherham.&rdquo;          &ldquo;With how many?&rdquo; demanded the leader, for such he seemed to be.          &ldquo;With six men, and good hope of booty, if it please St Nicholas.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Devoutly spoken,&rdquo; said Locksley; &ldquo;and where is  Allan-a-Dale?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Walked up towards the Watling-street, to watch for the Prior of  Jorvaulx.&rdquo;          &ldquo;That is well thought on also,&rdquo; replied the  Captain;&mdash;&ldquo;and where is the Friar?&rdquo;          &ldquo;In his cell.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thither will I go,&rdquo; said Locksley. &ldquo;Disperse and seek your  companions. Collect what force you can, for there&rsquo;s game afoot that must  be hunted hard, and will turn to bay. Meet me here by daybreak.&mdash;And  stay,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I have forgotten what is most necessary of the  whole&mdash;Two of you take the road quickly towards Torquilstone, the Castle  of Front-de-Bœuf. A set of gallants, who have been masquerading in such guise  as our own, are carrying a band of prisoners thither&mdash;Watch them closely,  for even if they reach the castle before we collect our force, our honour is  concerned to punish them, and we will find means to do so. Keep a close watch  on them therefore; and dispatch one of your comrades, the lightest of foot, to  bring the news of the yeomen thereabout.&rdquo;          They promised implicit obedience, and departed with alacrity on their different  errands. In the meanwhile, their leader and his two companions, who now looked  upon him with great respect, as well as some fear, pursued their way to the  Chapel of Copmanhurst.          When they had reached the little moonlight glade, having in front the reverend,  though ruinous chapel, and the rude hermitage, so well suited to ascetic  devotion, Wamba whispered to Gurth, &ldquo;If this be the habitation of a  thief, it makes good the old proverb, The nearer the church the farther from  God.&mdash;And by my coxcomb,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I think it be even  so&mdash;Hearken but to the black sanctus which they are singing in the  hermitage!&rdquo;          In fact the anchorite and his guest were performing, at the full extent of  their very powerful lungs, an old drinking song, of which this was the  burden:&mdash;          &ldquo;Come, trowl the brown bowl to me,       Bully boy, bully boy,   Come, trowl the brown bowl to me:       Ho! jolly Jenkin, I spy a knave in drinking,   Come, trowl the brown bowl to me.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Now, that is not ill sung,&rdquo; said Wamba, who had thrown in a few of  his own flourishes to help out the chorus. &ldquo;But who, in the saint&rsquo;s  name, ever expected to have heard such a jolly chant come from out a  hermit&rsquo;s cell at midnight!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Marry, that should I,&rdquo; said Gurth, &ldquo;for the jolly Clerk of  Copmanhurst is a known man, and kills half the deer that are stolen in this  walk. Men say that the keeper has complained to his official, and that he will  be stripped of his cowl and cope altogether, if he keeps not better  order.&rdquo;          While they were thus speaking, Locksley&rsquo;s loud and repeated knocks had at  length disturbed the anchorite and his guest. &ldquo;By my beads,&rdquo; said  the hermit, stopping short in a grand flourish, &ldquo;here come more benighted  guests. I would not for my cowl that they found us in this goodly exercise. All  men have their enemies, good Sir Sluggard; and there be those malignant enough  to construe the hospitable refreshment which I have been offering to you, a  weary traveller, for the matter of three short hours, into sheer drunkenness  and debauchery, vices alike alien to my profession and my disposition.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Base calumniators!&rdquo; replied the knight; &ldquo;I would I had the  chastising of them. Nevertheless, Holy Clerk, it is true that all have their  enemies; and there be those in this very land whom I would rather speak to  through the bars of my helmet than barefaced.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Get thine iron pot on thy head then, friend Sluggard, as quickly as thy  nature will permit,&rdquo; said the hermit, &ldquo;while I remove these pewter  flagons, whose late contents run strangely in mine own pate; and to drown the  clatter&mdash;for, in faith, I feel somewhat unsteady&mdash;strike into the  tune which thou hearest me sing; it is no matter for the words&mdash;I scarce  know them myself.&rdquo;          So saying, he struck up a thundering &ldquo;De profundis clamavi&rdquo;, under  cover of which he removed the apparatus of their banquet: while the knight,  laughing heartily, and arming himself all the while, assisted his host with his  voice from time to time as his mirth permitted.          &ldquo;What devil&rsquo;s matins are you after at this hour?&rdquo; said a  voice from without.          &ldquo;Heaven forgive you, Sir Traveller!&rdquo; said the hermit, whose own  noise, and perhaps his nocturnal potations, prevented from recognising accents  which were tolerably familiar to him&mdash;&ldquo;Wend on your way, in the name  of God and Saint Dunstan, and disturb not the devotions of me and my holy  brother.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Mad priest,&rdquo; answered the voice from without, &ldquo;open to  Locksley!&rdquo;          &ldquo;All&rsquo;s safe&mdash;all&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said the hermit to his  companion.          &ldquo;But who is he?&rdquo; said the Black Knight; &ldquo;it imports me much  to know.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; answered the hermit; &ldquo;I tell thee he is a  friend.&rdquo;          &ldquo;But what friend?&rdquo; answered the knight; &ldquo;for he may be friend  to thee and none of mine?&rdquo;          &ldquo;What friend?&rdquo; replied the hermit; &ldquo;that, now, is one of the  questions that is more easily asked than answered. What friend?&mdash;why, he  is, now that I bethink me a little, the very same honest keeper I told thee of  a while since.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay, as honest a keeper as thou art a pious hermit,&rdquo; replied the  knight, &ldquo;I doubt it not. But undo the door to him before he beat it from  its hinges.&rdquo;          The dogs, in the meantime, which had made a dreadful baying at the commencement  of the disturbance, seemed now to recognise the voice of him who stood without;  for, totally changing their manner, they scratched and whined at the door, as  if interceding for his admission. The hermit speedily unbolted his portal, and  admitted Locksley, with his two companions.          &ldquo;Why, hermit,&rdquo; was the yeoman&rsquo;s first question as soon as he  beheld the knight, &ldquo;what boon companion hast thou here?&rdquo;          &ldquo;A brother of our order,&rdquo; replied the friar, shaking his head;  &ldquo;we have been at our orisons all night.&rdquo;          &ldquo;He is a monk of the church militant, I think,&rdquo; answered Locksley;  &ldquo;and there be more of them abroad. I tell thee, friar, thou must lay down  the rosary and take up the quarter-staff; we shall need every one of our merry  men, whether clerk or layman.&mdash;But,&rdquo; he added, taking him a step  aside, &ldquo;art thou mad? to give admittance to a knight thou dost not know?  Hast thou forgot our articles?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Not know him!&rdquo; replied the friar, boldly, &ldquo;I know him as  well as the beggar knows his dish.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And what is his name, then?&rdquo; demanded Locksley.          &ldquo;His name,&rdquo; said the hermit&mdash;&ldquo;his name is Sir Anthony of  Scrabelstone&mdash;as if I would drink with a man, and did not know his  name!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou hast been drinking more than enough, friar,&rdquo; said the  woodsman, &ldquo;and, I fear, prating more than enough too.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Good yeoman,&rdquo; said the knight, coming forward, &ldquo;be not wroth  with my merry host. He did but afford me the hospitality which I would have  compelled from him if he had refused it.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou compel!&rdquo; said the friar; &ldquo;wait but till have changed  this grey gown for a green cassock, and if I make not a quarter-staff ring  twelve upon thy pate, I am neither true clerk nor good woodsman.&rdquo;          While he spoke thus, he stript off his gown, and appeared in a close black  buckram doublet and drawers, over which he speedily did on a cassock of green,  and hose of the same colour. &ldquo;I pray thee truss my points,&rdquo; said he  to Wamba, &ldquo;and thou shalt have a cup of sack for thy labour.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Gramercy for thy sack,&rdquo; said Wamba; &ldquo;but think&rsquo;st thou  it is lawful for me to aid you to transmew thyself from a holy hermit into a  sinful forester?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Never fear,&rdquo; said the hermit; &ldquo;I will but confess the sins  of my green cloak to my greyfriar&rsquo;s frock, and all shall be well  again.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; answered the Jester; &ldquo;a broadcloth penitent should  have a sackcloth confessor, and your frock may absolve my motley doublet into  the bargain.&rdquo;          So saying, he accommodated the friar with his assistance in tying the endless  number of points, as the laces which attached the hose to the doublet were then  termed.          While they were thus employed, Locksley led the knight a little apart, and  addressed him thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Deny it not, Sir Knight&mdash;you are he who  decided the victory to the advantage of the English against the strangers on  the second day of the tournament at Ashby.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And what follows if you guess truly, good yeoman?&rdquo; replied the  knight.          &ldquo;I should in that case hold you,&rdquo; replied the yeoman, &ldquo;a  friend to the weaker party.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Such is the duty of a true knight at least,&rdquo; replied the Black  Champion; &ldquo;and I would not willingly that there were reason to think  otherwise of me.&rdquo;          &ldquo;But for my purpose,&rdquo; said the yeoman, &ldquo;thou shouldst be as  well a good Englishman as a good knight; for that, which I have to speak of,  concerns, indeed, the duty of every honest man, but is more especially that of  a true-born native of England.&rdquo;          &ldquo;You can speak to no one,&rdquo; replied the knight, &ldquo;to whom  England, and the life of every Englishman, can be dearer than to me.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I would willingly believe so,&rdquo; said the woodsman, &ldquo;for never  had this country such need to be supported by those who love her. Hear me, and  I will tell thee of an enterprise, in which, if thou be&rsquo;st really that  which thou seemest, thou mayst take an honourable part. A band of villains, in  the disguise of better men than themselves, have made themselves master of the  person of a noble Englishman, called Cedric the Saxon, together with his ward,  and his friend Athelstane of Coningsburgh, and have transported them to a  castle in this forest, called Torquilstone. I ask of thee, as a good knight and  a good Englishman, wilt thou aid in their rescue?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I am bound by my vow to do so,&rdquo; replied the knight; &ldquo;but I  would willingly know who you are, who request my assistance in their  behalf?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said the forester, &ldquo;a nameless man; but I am the  friend of my country, and of my country&rsquo;s friends&mdash;With this account  of me you must for the present remain satisfied, the more especially since you  yourself desire to continue unknown. Believe, however, that my word, when  pledged, is as inviolate as if I wore golden spurs.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I willingly believe it,&rdquo; said the knight; &ldquo;I have been  accustomed to study men&rsquo;s countenances, and I can read in thine honesty  and resolution. I will, therefore, ask thee no further questions, but aid thee  in setting at freedom these oppressed captives; which done, I trust we shall  part better acquainted, and well satisfied with each other.&rdquo;          &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said Wamba to Gurth,&mdash;for the friar being now fully  equipped, the Jester, having approached to the other side of the hut, had heard  the conclusion of the conversation,&mdash;&ldquo;So we have got a new  ally?&mdash;I trust the valour of the knight will be truer metal than the  religion of the hermit, or the honesty of the yeoman; for this Locksley looks  like a born deer-stealer, and the priest like a lusty hypocrite.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Hold thy peace, Wamba,&rdquo; said Gurth; &ldquo;it may all be as thou  dost guess; but were the horned devil to rise and proffer me his assistance to  set at liberty Cedric and the Lady Rowena, I fear I should hardly have religion  enough to refuse the foul fiend&rsquo;s offer, and bid him get behind  me.&rdquo;          The friar was now completely accoutred as a yeoman, with sword and buckler,  bow, and quiver, and a strong partisan over his shoulder. He left his cell at  the head of the party, and, having carefully locked the door, deposited the key  under the threshold.          &ldquo;Art thou in condition to do good service, friar,&rdquo; said Locksley,  &ldquo;or does the brown bowl still run in thy head?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Not more than a drought of St Dunstan&rsquo;s fountain will  allay,&rdquo; answered the priest; &ldquo;something there is of a whizzing in  my brain, and of instability in my legs, but you shall presently see both pass  away.&rdquo;          So saying, he stepped to the stone basin, in which the waters of the fountain  as they fell formed bubbles which danced in the white moonlight, and took so  long a drought as if he had meant to exhaust the spring.          &ldquo;When didst thou drink as deep a drought of water before, Holy Clerk of  Copmanhurst?&rdquo; said the Black Knight.          &ldquo;Never since my wine-butt leaked, and let out its liquor by an illegal  vent,&rdquo; replied the friar, &ldquo;and so left me nothing to drink but my  patron&rsquo;s bounty here.&rdquo;          Then plunging his hands and head into the fountain, he washed from them all  marks of the midnight revel.          Thus refreshed and sobered, the jolly priest twirled his heavy partisan round  his head with three fingers, as if he had been balancing a reed, exclaiming at  the same time, &ldquo;Where be those false ravishers, who carry off wenches  against their will? May the foul fiend fly off with me, if I am not man enough  for a dozen of them.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Swearest thou, Holy Clerk?&rdquo; said the Black Knight.          &ldquo;Clerk me no Clerks,&rdquo; replied the transformed priest; &ldquo;by  Saint George and the Dragon, I am no longer a shaveling than while my frock is  on my back&mdash;When I am cased in my green cassock, I will drink, swear, and  woo a lass, with any blithe forester in the West Riding.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Come on, Jack Priest,&rdquo; said Locksley, &ldquo;and be silent; thou  art as noisy as a whole convent on a holy eve, when the Father Abbot has gone  to bed.&mdash;Come on you, too, my masters, tarry not to talk of it&mdash;I  say, come on, we must collect all our forces, and few enough we shall have, if  we are to storm the Castle of Reginald Front-de-Bœuf.&rdquo;          &ldquo;What! is it Front-de-Bœuf,&rdquo; said the Black Knight, &ldquo;who has  stopt on the king&rsquo;s highway the king&rsquo;s liege subjects?&mdash;Is he  turned thief and oppressor?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Oppressor he ever was,&rdquo; said Locksley.          &ldquo;And for thief,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;I doubt if ever he were  even half so honest a man as many a thief of my acquaintance.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Move on, priest, and be silent,&rdquo; said the yeoman; &ldquo;it were  better you led the way to the place of rendezvous, than say what should be left  unsaid, both in decency and prudence.&rdquo;                     CHAPTER XXI        Alas, how many hours and years have past,   Since human forms have round this table sate,   Or lamp, or taper, on its surface gleam&rsquo;d!   Methinks, I hear the sound of time long pass&rsquo;d   Still murmuring o&rsquo;er us, in the lofty void   Of these dark arches, like the ling&rsquo;ring voices   Of those who long within their graves have slept.          O RRA, A  T RAGEDY           While these measures were taking in behalf of Cedric and his companions, the  armed men by whom the latter had been seized, hurried their captives along  towards the place of security, where they intended to imprison them. But  darkness came on fast, and the paths of the wood seemed but imperfectly known  to the marauders. They were compelled to make several long halts, and once or  twice to return on their road to resume the direction which they wished to  pursue. The summer morn had dawned upon them ere they could travel in full  assurance that they held the right path. But confidence returned with light,  and the cavalcade now moved rapidly forward. Meanwhile, the following dialogue  took place between the two leaders of the banditti.          &ldquo;It is time thou shouldst leave us, Sir Maurice,&rdquo; said the Templar  to De Bracy, &ldquo;in order to prepare the second part of thy mystery. Thou  art next, thou knowest, to act the Knight Deliverer.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I have thought better of it,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;I will not  leave thee till the prize is fairly deposited in Front-de-Bœuf&rsquo;s castle.  There will I appear before the Lady Rowena in mine own shape, and trust that  she will set down to the vehemence of my passion the violence of which I have  been guilty.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And what has made thee change thy plan, De Bracy?&rdquo; replied the  Knight Templar.          &ldquo;That concerns thee nothing,&rdquo; answered his companion.          &ldquo;I would hope, however, Sir Knight,&rdquo; said the Templar, &ldquo;that  this alteration of measures arises from no suspicion of my honourable meaning,  such as Fitzurse endeavoured to instil into thee?&rdquo;          &ldquo;My thoughts are my own,&rdquo; answered De Bracy; &ldquo;the fiend  laughs, they say, when one thief robs another; and we know, that were he to  spit fire and brimstone instead, it would never prevent a Templar from  following his bent.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Or the leader of a Free Company,&rdquo; answered the Templar,  &ldquo;from dreading at the hands of a comrade and friend, the injustice he  does to all mankind.&rdquo;          &ldquo;This is unprofitable and perilous recrimination,&rdquo; answered De  Bracy; &ldquo;suffice it to say, I know the morals of the Temple-Order, and I  will not give thee the power of cheating me out of the fair prey for which I  have run such risks.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Psha,&rdquo; replied the Templar, &ldquo;what hast thou to  fear?&mdash;Thou knowest the vows of our order.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Right well,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;and also how they are kept.  Come, Sir Templar, the laws of gallantry have a liberal interpretation in  Palestine, and this is a case in which I will trust nothing to your  conscience.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Hear the truth, then,&rdquo; said the Templar; &ldquo;I care not for  your blue-eyed beauty. There is in that train one who will make me a better  mate.&rdquo;          &ldquo;What! wouldst thou stoop to the waiting damsel?&rdquo; said De Bracy.          &ldquo;No, Sir Knight,&rdquo; said the Templar, haughtily. &ldquo;To the  waiting-woman will I not stoop. I have a prize among the captives as lovely as  thine own.&rdquo;          &ldquo;By the mass, thou meanest the fair Jewess!&rdquo; said De Bracy.          &ldquo;And if I do,&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert, &ldquo;who shall gainsay  me?&rdquo;          &ldquo;No one that I know,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;unless it be your vow  of celibacy, or a check of conscience for an intrigue with a Jewess.&rdquo;          &ldquo;For my vow,&rdquo; said the Templar, &ldquo;our Grand Master hath  granted me a dispensation. And for my conscience, a man that has slain three  hundred Saracens, need not reckon up every little failing, like a village girl  at her first confession upon Good Friday eve.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou knowest best thine own privileges,&rdquo; said De Bracy.  &ldquo;Yet, I would have sworn thy thought had been more on the old  usurer&rsquo;s money bags, than on the black eyes of the daughter.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I can admire both,&rdquo; answered the Templar; &ldquo;besides, the old  Jew is but half-prize. I must share his spoils with Front-de-Bœuf, who will  not lend us the use of his castle for nothing. I must have something that I can  term exclusively my own by this foray of ours, and I have fixed on the lovely  Jewess as my peculiar prize. But, now thou knowest my drift, thou wilt resume  thine own original plan, wilt thou not?&mdash;Thou hast nothing, thou seest, to  fear from my interference.&rdquo;          &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied De Bracy, &ldquo;I will remain beside my prize. What  thou sayst is passing true, but I like not the privileges acquired by the  dispensation of the Grand Master, and the merit acquired by the slaughter of  three hundred Saracens. You have too good a right to a free pardon, to render  you very scrupulous about peccadilloes.&rdquo;          While this dialogue was proceeding, Cedric was endeavouring to wring out of  those who guarded him an avowal of their character and purpose. &ldquo;You  should be Englishmen,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and yet, sacred Heaven! you prey  upon your countrymen as if you were very Normans. You should be my neighbours,  and, if so, my friends; for which of my English neighbours have reason to be  otherwise? I tell ye, yeomen, that even those among ye who have been branded  with outlawry have had from me protection; for I have pitied their miseries,  and curst the oppression of their tyrannic nobles. What, then, would you have  of me? or in what can this violence serve ye?&mdash;Ye are worse than brute  beasts in your actions, and will you imitate them in their very  dumbness?&rdquo;          It was in vain that Cedric expostulated with his guards, who had too many good  reasons for their silence to be induced to break it either by his wrath or his  expostulations. They continued to hurry him along, travelling at a very rapid  rate, until, at the end of an avenue of huge trees, arose Torquilstone, now the  hoary and ancient castle of Reginald Front-de-Bœuf. It was a fortress of no  great size, consisting of a donjon, or large and high square tower, surrounded  by buildings of inferior height, which were encircled by an inner court-yard.  Around the exterior wall was a deep moat, supplied with water from a  neighbouring rivulet. Front-de-Bœuf, whose character placed him often at feud  with his enemies, had made considerable additions to the strength of his  castle, by building towers upon the outward wall, so as to flank it at every  angle. The access, as usual in castles of the period, lay through an arched  barbican, or outwork, which was terminated and defended by a small turret at  each corner.          Cedric no sooner saw the turrets of Front-de-Bœuf&rsquo;s castle raise their  grey and moss-grown battlements, glimmering in the morning sun above the wood  by which they were surrounded, than he instantly augured more truly concerning  the cause of his misfortune.          &ldquo;I did injustice,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to the thieves and outlaws of  these woods, when I supposed such banditti to belong to their bands; I might as  justly have confounded the foxes of these brakes with the ravening wolves of  France. Tell me, dogs&mdash;is it my life or my wealth that your master aims  at? Is it too much that two Saxons, myself and the noble Athelstane, should  hold land in the country which was once the patrimony of our race?&mdash;Put us  then to death, and complete your tyranny by taking our lives, as you began with  our liberties. If the Saxon Cedric cannot rescue England, he is willing to die  for her. Tell your tyrannical master, I do only beseech him to dismiss the Lady  Rowena in honour and safety. She is a woman, and he need not dread her; and  with us will die all who dare fight in her cause.&rdquo;          The attendants remained as mute to this address as to the former, and they now  stood before the gate of the castle. De Bracy winded his horn three times, and  the archers and cross-bow men, who had manned the wall upon seeing their  approach, hastened to lower the drawbridge, and admit them. The prisoners were  compelled by their guards to alight, and were conducted to an apartment where a  hasty repast was offered them, of which none but Athelstane felt any  inclination to partake. Neither had the descendant of the Confessor much time  to do justice to the good cheer placed before them, for their guards gave him  and Cedric to understand that they were to be imprisoned in a chamber apart  from Rowena. Resistance was vain; and they were compelled to follow to a large  room, which, rising on clumsy Saxon pillars, resembled those refectories and  chapter-houses which may be still seen in the most ancient parts of our most  ancient monasteries.          The Lady Rowena was next separated from her train, and conducted, with  courtesy, indeed, but still without consulting her inclination, to a distant  apartment. The same alarming distinction was conferred on Rebecca, in spite of  her father&rsquo;s entreaties, who offered even money, in this extremity of  distress, that she might be permitted to abide with him. &ldquo;Base  unbeliever,&rdquo; answered one of his guards, &ldquo;when thou hast seen thy  lair, thou wilt not wish thy daughter to partake it.&rdquo; And, without  farther discussion, the old Jew was forcibly dragged off in a different  direction from the other prisoners. The domestics, after being carefully  searched and disarmed, were confined in another part of the castle; and Rowena  was refused even the comfort she might have derived from the attendance of her  handmaiden Elgitha.          The apartment in which the Saxon chiefs were confined, for to them we turn our  first attention, although at present used as a sort of guard-room, had formerly  been the great hall of the castle. It was now abandoned to meaner purposes,  because the present lord, among other additions to the convenience, security,  and beauty of his baronial residence, had erected a new and noble hall, whose  vaulted roof was supported by lighter and more elegant pillars, and fitted up  with that higher degree of ornament, which the Normans had already introduced  into architecture.          Cedric paced the apartment, filled with indignant reflections on the past and  on the present, while the apathy of his companion served, instead of patience  and philosophy, to defend him against every thing save the inconvenience of the  present moment; and so little did he feel even this last, that he was only from  time to time roused to a reply by Cedric&rsquo;s animated and impassioned  appeal to him.          &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cedric, half speaking to himself, and half addressing  himself to Athelstane, &ldquo;it was in this very hall that my father feasted  with Torquil Wolfganger, when he entertained the valiant and unfortunate  Harold, then advancing against the Norwegians, who had united themselves to the  rebel Tosti. It was in this hall that Harold returned the magnanimous answer to  the ambassador of his rebel brother. Oft have I heard my father kindle as he  told the tale. The envoy of Tosti was admitted, when this ample room could  scarce contain the crowd of noble Saxon leaders, who were quaffing the  blood-red wine around their monarch.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Athelstane, somewhat moved by this part of his  friend&rsquo;s discourse, &ldquo;they will not forget to send us some wine and  refactions at noon&mdash;we had scarce a breathing-space allowed to break our  fast, and I never have the benefit of my food when I eat immediately after  dismounting from horseback, though the leeches recommend that practice.&rdquo;          Cedric went on with his story without noticing this interjectional observation  of his friend.          &ldquo;The envoy of Tosti,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;moved up the hall, undismayed  by the frowning countenances of all around him, until he made his obeisance  before the throne of King Harold.          &ldquo;&lsquo;What terms,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;Lord King, hath thy brother  Tosti to hope, if he should lay down his arms, and crave peace at thy  hands?&rsquo;          &ldquo;&lsquo;A brother&rsquo;s love,&rsquo; cried the generous Harold,  &lsquo;and the fair earldom of Northumberland.&rsquo;          &ldquo;&lsquo;But should Tosti accept these terms,&rsquo; continued the envoy,  &lsquo;what lands shall be assigned to his faithful ally, Hardrada, King of  Norway?&rsquo;          &ldquo;&lsquo;Seven feet of English ground,&rsquo; answered Harold, fiercely,  &lsquo;or, as Hardrada is said to be a giant, perhaps we may allow him twelve  inches more.&rsquo;          &ldquo;The hall rung with acclamations, and cup and horn was filled to the  Norwegian, who should be speedily in possession of his English  territory.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I could have pledged him with all my soul,&rdquo; said Athelstane,  &ldquo;for my tongue cleaves to my palate.&rdquo;          &ldquo;The baffled envoy,&rdquo; continued Cedric, pursuing with animation his  tale, though it interested not the listener, &ldquo;retreated, to carry to  Tosti and his ally the ominous answer of his injured brother. It was then that  the distant towers of York, and the bloody streams of the Derwent,   26   beheld that direful conflict, in  which, after displaying the most undaunted valour, the King of Norway, and  Tosti, both fell, with ten thousand of their bravest followers. Who would have  thought that upon the proud day when this battle was won, the very gale which  waved the Saxon banners in triumph, was filling the Norman sails, and impelling  them to the fatal shores of Sussex?&mdash;Who would have thought that Harold,  within a few brief days, would himself possess no more of his kingdom, than the  share which he allotted in his wrath to the Norwegian invader?&mdash;Who would  have thought that you, noble Athelstane&mdash;that you, descended of  Harold&rsquo;s blood, and that I, whose father was not the worst defender of  the Saxon crown, should be prisoners to a vile Norman, in the very hall in  which our ancestors held such high festival?&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is sad enough,&rdquo; replied Athelstane; &ldquo;but I trust they  will hold us to a moderate ransom&mdash;At any rate it cannot be their purpose  to starve us outright; and yet, although it is high noon, I see no preparations  for serving dinner. Look up at the window, noble Cedric, and judge by the  sunbeams if it is not on the verge of noon.&rdquo;          &ldquo;It may be so,&rdquo; answered Cedric; &ldquo;but I cannot look on that  stained lattice without its awakening other reflections than those which  concern the passing moment, or its privations. When that window was wrought, my  noble friend, our hardy fathers knew not the art of making glass, or of  staining it&mdash;The pride of Wolfganger&rsquo;s father brought an artist from  Normandy to adorn his hall with this new species of emblazonment, that breaks  the golden light of God&rsquo;s blessed day into so many fantastic hues. The  foreigner came here poor, beggarly, cringing, and subservient, ready to doff  his cap to the meanest native of the household. He returned pampered and proud,  to tell his rapacious countrymen of the wealth and the simplicity of the Saxon  nobles&mdash;a folly, oh, Athelstane, foreboded of old, as well as foreseen, by  those descendants of Hengist and his hardy tribes, who retained the simplicity  of their manners. We made these strangers our bosom friends, our confidential  servants; we borrowed their artists and their arts, and despised the honest  simplicity and hardihood with which our brave ancestors supported themselves,  and we became enervated by Norman arts long ere we fell under Norman arms. Far  better was our homely diet, eaten in peace and liberty, than the luxurious  dainties, the love of which hath delivered us as bondsmen to the foreign  conqueror!&rdquo;          &ldquo;I should,&rdquo; replied Athelstane, &ldquo;hold very humble diet a  luxury at present; and it astonishes me, noble Cedric, that you can bear so  truly in mind the memory of past deeds, when it appeareth you forget the very  hour of dinner.&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is time lost,&rdquo; muttered Cedric apart and impatiently, &ldquo;to  speak to him of aught else but that which concerns his appetite! The soul of  Hardicanute hath taken possession of him, and he hath no pleasure save to fill,  to swill, and to call for more.&mdash;Alas!&rdquo; said he, looking at  Athelstane with compassion, &ldquo;that so dull a spirit should be lodged in so  goodly a form! Alas! that such an enterprise as the regeneration of England  should turn on a hinge so imperfect! Wedded to Rowena, indeed, her nobler and  more generous soul may yet awake the better nature which is torpid within him.  Yet how should this be, while Rowena, Athelstane, and I myself, remain the  prisoners of this brutal marauder and have been made so perhaps from a sense of  the dangers which our liberty might bring to the usurped power of his  nation?&rdquo;          While the Saxon was plunged in these painful reflections, the door of their  prison opened, and gave entrance to a sewer, holding his white rod of office.  This important person advanced into the chamber with a grave pace, followed by  four attendants, bearing in a table covered with dishes, the sight and smell of  which seemed to be an instant compensation to Athelstane for all the  inconvenience he had undergone. The persons who attended on the feast were  masked and cloaked.          &ldquo;What mummery is this?&rdquo; said Cedric; &ldquo;think you that we are  ignorant whose prisoners we are, when we are in the castle of your master? Tell  him,&rdquo; he continued, willing to use this opportunity to open a negotiation  for his freedom,&mdash;&ldquo;Tell your master, Reginald Front-de-Bœuf, that  we know no reason he can have for withholding our liberty, excepting his  unlawful desire to enrich himself at our expense. Tell him that we yield to his  rapacity, as in similar circumstances we should do to that of a literal robber.  Let him name the ransom at which he rates our liberty, and it shall be paid,  providing the exaction is suited to our means.&rdquo; The sewer made no answer,  but bowed his head.          &ldquo;And tell Sir Reginald Front-de-Bœuf,&rdquo; said Athelstane,  &ldquo;that I send him my mortal defiance, and challenge him to combat with me,  on foot or horseback, at any secure place, within eight days after our  liberation; which, if he be a true knight, he will not, under these  circumstances, venture to refuse or to delay.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I shall deliver to the knight your defiance,&rdquo; answered the sewer;  &ldquo;meanwhile I leave you to your food.&rdquo;          The challenge of Athelstane was delivered with no good grace; for a large  mouthful, which required the exercise of both jaws at once, added to a natural  hesitation, considerably damped the effect of the bold defiance it contained.  Still, however, his speech was hailed by Cedric as an incontestible token of  reviving spirit in his companion, whose previous indifference had begun,  notwithstanding his respect for Athelstane&rsquo;s descent, to wear out his  patience. But he now cordially shook hands with him in token of his  approbation, and was somewhat grieved when Athelstane observed, &ldquo;that he  would fight a dozen such men as Front-de-Bœuf, if, by so doing, he could  hasten his departure from a dungeon where they put so much garlic into their  pottage.&rdquo; Notwithstanding this intimation of a relapse into the apathy of  sensuality, Cedric placed himself opposite to Athelstane, and soon showed, that  if the distresses of his country could banish the recollection of food while  the table was uncovered, yet no sooner were the victuals put there, than he  proved that the appetite of his Saxon ancestors had descended to him along with  their other qualities.          The captives had not long enjoyed their refreshment, however, ere their  attention was disturbed even from this most serious occupation by the blast of  a horn winded before the gate. It was repeated three times, with as much  violence as if it had been blown before an enchanted castle by the destined  knight, at whose summons halls and towers, barbican and battlement, were to  roll off like a morning vapour. The Saxons started from the table, and hastened  to the window. But their curiosity was disappointed; for these outlets only  looked upon the court of the castle, and the sound came from beyond its  precincts. The summons, however, seemed of importance, for a considerable  degree of bustle instantly took place in the castle.                     CHAPTER XXII        My daughter&mdash;O my ducats&mdash;O my daughter!   &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;O my Christian ducats!   Justice&mdash;the Law&mdash;my ducats, and my daughter!          M ERCHANT OF  V ENICE           Leaving the Saxon chiefs to return to their banquet as soon as their  ungratified curiosity should permit them to attend to the calls of their  half-satiated appetite, we have to look in upon the yet more severe  imprisonment of Isaac of York. The poor Jew had been hastily thrust into a  dungeon-vault of the castle, the floor of which was deep beneath the level of  the ground, and very damp, being lower than even the moat itself. The only  light was received through one or two loop-holes far above the reach of the  captive&rsquo;s hand. These apertures admitted, even at mid-day, only a dim and  uncertain light, which was changed for utter darkness long before the rest of  the castle had lost the blessing of day. Chains and shackles, which had been  the portion of former captives, from whom active exertions to escape had been  apprehended, hung rusted and empty on the walls of the prison, and in the rings  of one of those sets of fetters there remained two mouldering bones, which  seemed to have been once those of the human leg, as if some prisoner had been  left not only to perish there, but to be consumed to a skeleton.          At one end of this ghastly apartment was a large fire-grate, over the top of  which were stretched some transverse iron bars, half devoured with rust.          The whole appearance of the dungeon might have appalled a stouter heart than  that of Isaac, who, nevertheless, was more composed under the imminent pressure  of danger, than he had seemed to be while affected by terrors, of which the  cause was as yet remote and contingent. The lovers of the chase say that the  hare feels more agony during the pursuit of the greyhounds, than when she is  struggling in their fangs.   27            And thus it is probable, that the Jews, by the very frequency of their fear on  all occasions, had their minds in some degree prepared for every effort of  tyranny which could be practised upon them; so that no aggression, when it had  taken place, could bring with it that surprise which is the most disabling  quality of terror. Neither was it the first time that Isaac had been placed in  circumstances so dangerous. He had therefore experience to guide him, as well  as hope, that he might again, as formerly, be delivered as a prey from the  fowler. Above all, he had upon his side the unyielding obstinacy of his nation,  and that unbending resolution, with which Israelites have been frequently known  to submit to the uttermost evils which power and violence can inflict upon  them, rather than gratify their oppressors by granting their demands.          In this humour of passive resistance, and with his garment collected beneath  him to keep his limbs from the wet pavement, Isaac sat in a corner of his  dungeon, where his folded hands, his dishevelled hair and beard, his furred  cloak and high cap, seen by the wiry and broken light, would have afforded a  study for Rembrandt, had that celebrated painter existed at the period. The Jew  remained, without altering his position, for nearly three hours, at the expiry  of which steps were heard on the dungeon stair. The bolts screamed as they were  withdrawn&mdash;the hinges creaked as the wicket opened, and Reginald  Front-de-Bœuf, followed by the two Saracen slaves of the Templar, entered the  prison.          Front-de-Bœuf, a tall and strong man, whose life had been spent in public war  or in private feuds and broils, and who had hesitated at no means of extending  his feudal power, had features corresponding to his character, and which  strongly expressed the fiercer and more malignant passions of the mind. The  scars with which his visage was seamed, would, on features of a different cast,  have excited the sympathy and veneration due to the marks of honourable valour;  but, in the peculiar case of Front-de-Bœuf, they only added to the ferocity of  his countenance, and to the dread which his presence inspired. This formidable  baron was clad in a leathern doublet, fitted close to his body, which was  frayed and soiled with the stains of his armour. He had no weapon, excepting a  poniard at his belt, which served to counterbalance the weight of the bunch of  rusty keys that hung at his right side.          The black slaves who attended Front-de-Bœuf were stripped of their gorgeous  apparel, and attired in jerkins and trowsers of coarse linen, their sleeves  being tucked up above the elbow, like those of butchers when about to exercise  their function in the slaughter-house. Each had in his hand a small pannier;  and, when they entered the dungeon, they stopt at the door until Front-de-Bœuf  himself carefully locked and double-locked it. Having taken this precaution, he  advanced slowly up the apartment towards the Jew, upon whom he kept his eye  fixed, as if he wished to paralyze him with his glance, as some animals are  said to fascinate their prey. It seemed indeed as if the sullen and malignant  eye of Front-de-Bœuf possessed some portion of that supposed power over his  unfortunate prisoner. The Jew sat with his mouth agape, and his eyes fixed on  the savage baron with such earnestness of terror, that his frame seemed  literally to shrink together, and to diminish in size while encountering the  fierce Norman&rsquo;s fixed and baleful gaze. The unhappy Isaac was deprived  not only of the power of rising to make the obeisance which his terror  dictated, but he could not even doff his cap, or utter any word of  supplication; so strongly was he agitated by the conviction that tortures and  death were impending over him.          On the other hand, the stately form of the Norman appeared to dilate in  magnitude, like that of the eagle, which ruffles up its plumage when about to  pounce on its defenceless prey. He paused within three steps of the corner in  which the unfortunate Jew had now, as it were, coiled himself up into the  smallest possible space, and made a sign for one of the slaves to approach. The  black satellite came forward accordingly, and, producing from his basket a  large pair of scales and several weights, he laid them at the feet of  Front-de-Bœuf, and again retired to the respectful distance, at which his  companion had already taken his station.          The motions of these men were slow and solemn, as if there impended over their  souls some preconception of horror and of cruelty. Front-de-Bœuf himself  opened the scene by thus addressing his ill-fated captive.          &ldquo;Most accursed dog of an accursed race,&rdquo; he said, awaking with his  deep and sullen voice the sullen echoes of his dungeon vault, &ldquo;seest thou  these scales?&rdquo;          The unhappy Jew returned a feeble affirmative.          &ldquo;In these very scales shalt thou weigh me out,&rdquo; said the relentless  Baron, &ldquo;a thousand silver pounds, after the just measure and weight of  the Tower of London.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Holy Abraham!&rdquo; returned the Jew, finding voice through the very  extremity of his danger, &ldquo;heard man ever such a demand?&mdash;Who ever  heard, even in a minstrel&rsquo;s tale, of such a sum as a thousand pounds of  silver?&mdash;What human sight was ever blessed with the vision of such a mass  of treasure?&mdash;Not within the walls of York, ransack my house and that of  all my tribe, wilt thou find the tithe of that huge sum of silver that thou  speakest of.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I am reasonable,&rdquo; answered Front-de-Bœuf, &ldquo;and if silver be  scant, I refuse not gold. At the rate of a mark of gold for each six pounds of  silver, thou shalt free thy unbelieving carcass from such punishment as thy  heart has never even conceived.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Have mercy on me, noble knight!&rdquo; exclaimed Isaac; &ldquo;I am old,  and poor, and helpless. It were unworthy to triumph over me&mdash;It is a poor  deed to crush a worm.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Old thou mayst be,&rdquo; replied the knight; &ldquo;more shame to their  folly who have suffered thee to grow grey in usury and knavery&mdash;Feeble  thou mayst be, for when had a Jew either heart or hand&mdash;But rich it is  well known thou art.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I swear to you, noble knight,&rdquo; said the Jew &ldquo;by all which I  believe, and by all which we believe in common&mdash;-&rdquo;          &ldquo;Perjure not thyself,&rdquo; said the Norman, interrupting him,  &ldquo;and let not thine obstinacy seal thy doom, until thou hast seen and well  considered the fate that awaits thee. Think not I speak to thee only to excite  thy terror, and practise on the base cowardice thou hast derived from thy  tribe. I swear to thee by that which thou dost NOT believe, by the gospel which  our church teaches, and by the keys which are given her to bind and to loose,  that my purpose is deep and peremptory. This dungeon is no place for trifling.  Prisoners ten thousand times more distinguished than thou have died within  these walls, and their fate hath never been known! But for thee is reserved a  long and lingering death, to which theirs were luxury.&rdquo;          He again made a signal for the slaves to approach, and spoke to them apart, in  their own language; for he also had been in Palestine, where perhaps, he had  learnt his lesson of cruelty. The Saracens produced from their baskets a  quantity of charcoal, a pair of bellows, and a flask of oil. While the one  struck a light with a flint and steel, the other disposed the charcoal in the  large rusty grate which we have already mentioned, and exercised the bellows  until the fuel came to a red glow.          &ldquo;Seest thou, Isaac,&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf, &ldquo;the range of iron  bars above the glowing charcoal?&mdash;   28   on that warm  couch thou shalt lie, stripped of thy clothes as if thou wert to rest on a bed  of down. One of these slaves shall maintain the fire beneath thee, while the  other shall anoint thy wretched limbs with oil, lest the roast should  burn.&mdash;Now, choose betwixt such a scorching bed and the payment of a  thousand pounds of silver; for, by the head of my father, thou hast no other  option.&rdquo;                      &ldquo;It is impossible,&rdquo; exclaimed the miserable Jew&mdash;&ldquo;it is  impossible that your purpose can be real! The good God of nature never made a  heart capable of exercising such cruelty!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Trust not to that, Isaac,&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf, &ldquo;it were a  fatal error. Dost thou think that I, who have seen a town sacked, in which  thousands of my Christian countrymen perished by sword, by flood, and by fire,  will blench from my purpose for the outcries or screams of one single wretched  Jew?&mdash;or thinkest thou that these swarthy slaves, who have neither law,  country, nor conscience, but their master&rsquo;s will&mdash;who use the  poison, or the stake, or the poniard, or the cord, at his slightest  wink&mdash;thinkest thou that THEY will have mercy, who do not even understand  the language in which it is asked?&mdash;Be wise, old man; discharge thyself of  a portion of thy superfluous wealth; repay to the hands of a Christian a part  of what thou hast acquired by the usury thou hast practised on those of his  religion. Thy cunning may soon swell out once more thy shrivelled purse, but  neither leech nor medicine can restore thy scorched hide and flesh wert thou  once stretched on these bars. Tell down thy ransom, I say, and rejoice that at  such rate thou canst redeem thee from a dungeon, the secrets of which few have  returned to tell. I waste no more words with thee&mdash;choose between thy  dross and thy flesh and blood, and as thou choosest, so shall it be.&rdquo;          &ldquo;So may Abraham, Jacob, and all the fathers of our people assist  me,&rdquo; said Isaac, &ldquo;I cannot make the choice, because I have not the  means of satisfying your exorbitant demand!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Seize him and strip him, slaves,&rdquo; said the knight, &ldquo;and let  the fathers of his race assist him if they can.&rdquo;          The assistants, taking their directions more from the Baron&rsquo;s eye and his  hand than his tongue, once more stepped forward, laid hands on the unfortunate  Isaac, plucked him up from the ground, and, holding him between them, waited  the hard-hearted Baron&rsquo;s farther signal. The unhappy Jew eyed their  countenances and that of Front-de-Bœuf, in hope of discovering some symptoms  of relenting; but that of the Baron exhibited the same cold, half-sullen,  half-sarcastic smile which had been the prelude to his cruelty; and the savage  eyes of the Saracens, rolling gloomily under their dark brows, acquiring a yet  more sinister expression by the whiteness of the circle which surrounds the  pupil, evinced rather the secret pleasure which they expected from the  approaching scene, than any reluctance to be its directors or agents. The Jew  then looked at the glowing furnace, over which he was presently to be  stretched, and seeing no chance of his tormentor&rsquo;s relenting, his  resolution gave way.          &ldquo;I will pay,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the thousand pounds of  silver&mdash;That is,&rdquo; he added, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, &ldquo;I  will pay it with the help of my brethren; for I must beg as a mendicant at the  door of our synagogue ere I make up so unheard-of a sum.&mdash;When and where  must it be delivered?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; replied Front-de-Bœuf, &ldquo;here it must be  delivered&mdash;weighed it must be&mdash;weighed and told down on this very  dungeon floor.&mdash;Thinkest thou I will part with thee until thy ransom is  secure?&rdquo;          &ldquo;And what is to be my surety,&rdquo; said the Jew, &ldquo;that I shall be  at liberty after this ransom is paid?&rdquo;          &ldquo;The word of a Norman noble, thou pawn-broking slave,&rdquo; answered  Front-de-Bœuf; &ldquo;the faith of a Norman nobleman, more pure than the gold  and silver of thee and all thy tribe.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I crave pardon, noble lord,&rdquo; said Isaac timidly, &ldquo;but  wherefore should I rely wholly on the word of one who will trust nothing to  mine?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Because thou canst not help it, Jew,&rdquo; said the knight, sternly.  &ldquo;Wert thou now in thy treasure-chamber at York, and were I craving a loan  of thy shekels, it would be thine to dictate the time of payment, and the  pledge of security. This is MY treasure-chamber. Here I have thee at advantage,  nor will I again deign to repeat the terms on which I grant thee  liberty.&rdquo;          The Jew groaned deeply.&mdash;&ldquo;Grant me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;at least  with my own liberty, that of the companions with whom I travel. They scorned me  as a Jew, yet they pitied my desolation, and because they tarried to aid me by  the way, a share of my evil hath come upon them; moreover, they may contribute  in some sort to my ransom.&rdquo;          &ldquo;If thou meanest yonder Saxon churls,&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf,  &ldquo;their ransom will depend upon other terms than thine. Mind thine own  concerns, Jew, I warn thee, and meddle not with those of others.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I am, then,&rdquo; said Isaac, &ldquo;only to be set at liberty,  together with mine wounded friend?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Shall I twice recommend it,&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf, &ldquo;to a son  of Israel, to meddle with his own concerns, and leave those of others  alone?&mdash;Since thou hast made thy choice, it remains but that thou payest  down thy ransom, and that at a short day.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Yet hear me,&rdquo; said the Jew&mdash;&ldquo;for the sake of that very  wealth which thou wouldst obtain at the expense of thy&mdash;-&rdquo; Here he  stopt short, afraid of irritating the savage Norman. But Front-de-Bœuf only  laughed, and himself filled up the blank at which the Jew had hesitated.          &ldquo;At the expense of my conscience, thou wouldst say, Isaac; speak it  out&mdash;I tell thee, I am reasonable. I can bear the reproaches of a loser,  even when that loser is a Jew. Thou wert not so patient, Isaac, when thou didst  invoke justice against Jacques Fitzdotterel, for calling thee a usurious  blood-sucker, when thy exactions had devoured his patrimony.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I swear by the Talmud,&rdquo; said the Jew, &ldquo;that your valour has  been misled in that matter. Fitzdotterel drew his poniard upon me in mine own  chamber, because I craved him for mine own silver. The term of payment was due  at the Passover.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I care not what he did,&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf; &ldquo;the question  is, when shall I have mine own?&mdash;when shall I have the shekels,  Isaac?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Let my daughter Rebecca go forth to York,&rdquo; answered Isaac,  &ldquo;with your safe conduct, noble knight, and so soon as man and horse can  return, the treasure&mdash;-&rdquo; Here he groaned deeply, but added, after  the pause of a few seconds,&mdash;&ldquo;The treasure shall be told down on  this very floor.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thy daughter!&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf, as if  surprised,&mdash;&ldquo;By heavens, Isaac, I would I had known of this. I  deemed that yonder black-browed girl had been thy concubine, and I gave her to  be a handmaiden to Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert, after the fashion of patriarchs  and heroes of the days of old, who set us in these matters a wholesome  example.&rdquo;          The yell which Isaac raised at this unfeeling communication made the very vault  to ring, and astounded the two Saracens so much that they let go their hold of  the Jew. He availed himself of his enlargement to throw himself on the  pavement, and clasp the knees of Front-de-Bœuf.          &ldquo;Take all that you have asked,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Sir  Knight&mdash;take ten times more&mdash;reduce me to ruin and to beggary, if  thou wilt,&mdash;nay, pierce me with thy poniard, broil me on that furnace, but  spare my daughter, deliver her in safety and honour!&mdash;As thou art born of  woman, spare the honour of a helpless maiden&mdash;She is the image of my  deceased Rachel, she is the last of six pledges of her love&mdash;Will you  deprive a widowed husband of his sole remaining comfort?&mdash;Will you reduce  a father to wish that his only living child were laid beside her dead mother,  in the tomb of our fathers?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I would,&rdquo; said the Norman, somewhat relenting, &ldquo;that I had  known of this before. I thought your race had loved nothing save their  moneybags.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Think not so vilely of us, Jews though we be,&rdquo; said Isaac, eager  to improve the moment of apparent sympathy; &ldquo;the hunted fox, the tortured  wildcat loves its young&mdash;the despised and persecuted race of Abraham love  their children!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf; &ldquo;I will believe it in  future, Isaac, for thy very sake&mdash;but it aids us not now, I cannot help  what has happened, or what is to follow; my word is passed to my comrade in  arms, nor would I break it for ten Jews and Jewesses to boot. Besides, why  shouldst thou think evil is to come to the girl, even if she became  Bois-Guilbert&rsquo;s booty?&rdquo;          &ldquo;There will, there must!&rdquo; exclaimed Isaac, wringing his hands in  agony; &ldquo;when did Templars breathe aught but cruelty to men, and dishonour  to women!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Dog of an infidel,&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf, with sparkling eyes, and  not sorry, perhaps, to seize a pretext for working himself into a passion,  &ldquo;blaspheme not the Holy Order of the Temple of Zion, but take thought  instead to pay me the ransom thou hast promised, or woe betide thy Jewish  throat!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Robber and villain!&rdquo; said the Jew, retorting the insults of his  oppressor with passion, which, however impotent, he now found it impossible to  bridle, &ldquo;I will pay thee nothing&mdash;not one silver penny will I pay  thee, unless my daughter is delivered to me in safety and honour!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Art thou in thy senses, Israelite?&rdquo; said the Norman,  sternly&mdash;&ldquo;has thy flesh and blood a charm against heated iron and  scalding oil?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I care not!&rdquo; said the Jew, rendered desperate by paternal  affection; &ldquo;do thy worst. My daughter is my flesh and blood, dearer to me  a thousand times than those limbs which thy cruelty threatens. No silver will I  give thee, unless I were to pour it molten down thy avaricious throat&mdash;no,  not a silver penny will I give thee, Nazarene, were it to save thee from the  deep damnation thy whole life has merited! Take my life if thou wilt, and say,  the Jew, amidst his tortures, knew how to disappoint the Christian.&rdquo;          &ldquo;We shall see that,&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf; &ldquo;for by the blessed  rood, which is the abomination of thy accursed tribe, thou shalt feel the  extremities of fire and steel!&mdash;Strip him, slaves, and chain him down upon  the bars.&rdquo;          In spite of the feeble struggles of the old man, the Saracens had already torn  from him his upper garment, and were proceeding totally to disrobe him, when  the sound of a bugle, twice winded without the castle, penetrated even to the  recesses of the dungeon, and immediately after loud voices were heard calling  for Sir Reginald Front-de-Bœuf. Unwilling to be found engaged in his hellish  occupation, the savage Baron gave the slaves a signal to restore Isaac&rsquo;s  garment, and, quitting the dungeon with his attendants, he left the Jew to  thank God for his own deliverance, or to lament over his daughter&rsquo;s  captivity, and probable fate, as his personal or parental feelings might prove  strongest.                     CHAPTER XXIII        Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words   Can no way change you to a milder form,   I&rsquo;ll woo you, like a soldier, at arms&rsquo; end,   And love you &rsquo;gainst the nature of love, force you.          T WO  G ENTLEMEN OF  V ERONA           The apartment to which the Lady Rowena had been introduced was fitted up with  some rude attempts at ornament and magnificence, and her being placed there  might be considered as a peculiar mark of respect not offered to the other  prisoners. But the wife of Front-de-Bœuf, for whom it had been originally  furnished, was long dead, and decay and neglect had impaired the few ornaments  with which her taste had adorned it. The tapestry hung down from the walls in  many places, and in others was tarnished and faded under the effects of the  sun, or tattered and decayed by age. Desolate, however, as it was, this was the  apartment of the castle which had been judged most fitting for the  accommodation of the Saxon heiress; and here she was left to meditate upon her  fate, until the actors in this nefarious drama had arranged the several parts  which each of them was to perform. This had been settled in a council held by  Front-de-Bœuf, De Bracy, and the Templar, in which, after a long and warm  debate concerning the several advantages which each insisted upon deriving from  his peculiar share in this audacious enterprise, they had at length determined  the fate of their unhappy prisoners.          It was about the hour of noon, therefore, when De Bracy, for whose advantage  the expedition had been first planned, appeared to prosecute his views upon the  hand and possessions of the Lady Rowena.          The interval had not entirely been bestowed in holding council with his  confederates, for De Bracy had found leisure to decorate his person with all  the foppery of the times. His green cassock and vizard were now flung aside.  His long luxuriant hair was trained to flow in quaint tresses down his richly  furred cloak. His beard was closely shaved, his doublet reached to the middle  of his leg, and the girdle which secured it, and at the same time supported his  ponderous sword, was embroidered and embossed with gold work. We have already  noticed the extravagant fashion of the shoes at this period, and the points of  Maurice de Bracy&rsquo;s might have challenged the prize of extravagance with  the gayest, being turned up and twisted like the horns of a ram. Such was the  dress of a gallant of the period; and, in the present instance, that effect was  aided by the handsome person and good demeanour of the wearer, whose manners  partook alike of the grace of a courtier, and the frankness of a soldier.          He saluted Rowena by doffing his velvet bonnet, garnished with a golden broach,  representing St Michael trampling down the Prince of Evil. With this, he gently  motioned the lady to a seat; and, as she still retained her standing posture,  the knight ungloved his right hand, and motioned to conduct her thither. But  Rowena declined, by her gesture, the proffered compliment, and replied,  &ldquo;If I be in the presence of my jailor, Sir Knight&mdash;nor will  circumstances allow me to think otherwise&mdash;it best becomes his prisoner to  remain standing till she learns her doom.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Alas! fair Rowena,&rdquo; returned De Bracy, &ldquo;you are in presence  of your captive, not your jailor; and it is from your fair eyes that De Bracy  must receive that doom which you fondly expect from him.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I know you not, sir,&rdquo; said the lady, drawing herself up with all  the pride of offended rank and beauty; &ldquo;I know you not&mdash;and the  insolent familiarity with which you apply to me the jargon of a troubadour,  forms no apology for the violence of a robber.&rdquo;          &ldquo;To thyself, fair maid,&rdquo; answered De Bracy, in his former  tone&mdash;&ldquo;to thine own charms be ascribed whate&rsquo;er I have done  which passed the respect due to her, whom I have chosen queen of my heart, and  lodestar of my eyes.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I repeat to you, Sir Knight, that I know you not, and that no man  wearing chain and spurs ought thus to intrude himself upon the presence of an  unprotected lady.&rdquo;          &ldquo;That I am unknown to you,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;is indeed my  misfortune; yet let me hope that De Bracy&rsquo;s name has not been always  unspoken, when minstrels or heralds have praised deeds of chivalry, whether in  the lists or in the battle-field.&rdquo;          &ldquo;To heralds and to minstrels, then, leave thy praise, Sir Knight,&rdquo;  replied Rowena, &ldquo;more suiting for their mouths than for thine own; and  tell me which of them shall record in song, or in book of tourney, the  memorable conquest of this night, a conquest obtained over an old man, followed  by a few timid hinds; and its booty, an unfortunate maiden, transported against  her will to the castle of a robber?&rdquo;          &ldquo;You are unjust, Lady Rowena,&rdquo; said the knight, biting his lips in  some confusion, and speaking in a tone more natural to him than that of  affected gallantry, which he had at first adopted; &ldquo;yourself free from  passion, you can allow no excuse for the frenzy of another, although caused by  your own beauty.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I pray you, Sir Knight,&rdquo; said Rowena, &ldquo;to cease a language  so commonly used by strolling minstrels, that it becomes not the mouth of  knights or nobles. Certes, you constrain me to sit down, since you enter upon  such commonplace terms, of which each vile crowder hath a stock that might last  from hence to Christmas.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Proud damsel,&rdquo; said De Bracy, incensed at finding his gallant  style procured him nothing but contempt&mdash;&ldquo;proud damsel, thou shalt  be as proudly encountered. Know then, that I have supported my pretensions to  your hand in the way that best suited thy character. It is meeter for thy  humour to be wooed with bow and bill, than in set terms, and in courtly  language.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Courtesy of tongue,&rdquo; said Rowena, &ldquo;when it is used to veil  churlishness of deed, is but a knight&rsquo;s girdle around the breast of a  base clown. I wonder not that the restraint appears to gall you&mdash;more it  were for your honour to have retained the dress and language of an outlaw, than  to veil the deeds of one under an affectation of gentle language and  demeanour.&rdquo;          &ldquo;You counsel well, lady,&rdquo; said the Norman; &ldquo;and in the bold  language which best justifies bold action I tell thee, thou shalt never leave  this castle, or thou shalt leave it as Maurice de Bracy&rsquo;s wife. I am not  wont to be baffled in my enterprises, nor needs a Norman noble scrupulously to  vindicate his conduct to the Saxon maiden whom he distinguishes by the offer of  his hand. Thou art proud, Rowena, and thou art the fitter to be my wife. By  what other means couldst thou be raised to high honour and to princely place,  saving by my alliance? How else wouldst thou escape from the mean precincts of  a country grange, where Saxons herd with the swine which form their wealth, to  take thy seat, honoured as thou shouldst be, and shalt be, amid all in England  that is distinguished by beauty, or dignified by power?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Sir Knight,&rdquo; replied Rowena, &ldquo;the grange which you contemn  hath been my shelter from infancy; and, trust me, when I leave it&mdash;should  that day ever arrive&mdash;it shall be with one who has not learnt to despise  the dwelling and manners in which I have been brought up.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I guess your meaning, lady,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;though you may  think it lies too obscure for my apprehension. But dream not, that Richard  Cœur de Lion will ever resume his throne, far less that Wilfred of Ivanhoe,  his minion, will ever lead thee to his footstool, to be there welcomed as the  bride of a favourite. Another suitor might feel jealousy while he touched this  string; but my firm purpose cannot be changed by a passion so childish and so  hopeless. Know, lady, that this rival is in my power, and that it rests but  with me to betray the secret of his being within the castle to Front-de-Bœuf,  whose jealousy will be more fatal than mine.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Wilfred here?&rdquo; said Rowena, in disdain; &ldquo;that is as true as  that Front-de-Bœuf is his rival.&rdquo;          De Bracy looked at her steadily for an instant.          &ldquo;Wert thou really ignorant of this?&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;didst thou not  know that Wilfred of Ivanhoe travelled in the litter of the Jew?&mdash;a meet  conveyance for the crusader, whose doughty arm was to reconquer the Holy  Sepulchre!&rdquo; And he laughed scornfully.          &ldquo;And if he is here,&rdquo; said Rowena, compelling herself to a tone of  indifference, though trembling with an agony of apprehension which she could  not suppress, &ldquo;in what is he the rival of Front-de-Bœuf? or what has he  to fear beyond a short imprisonment, and an honourable ransom, according to the  use of chivalry?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Rowena,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;art thou, too, deceived by the  common error of thy sex, who think there can be no rivalry but that respecting  their own charms? Knowest thou not there is a jealousy of ambition and of  wealth, as well as of love; and that this our host, Front-de-Bœuf, will push  from his road him who opposes his claim to the fair barony of Ivanhoe, as  readily, eagerly, and unscrupulously, as if he were preferred to him by some  blue-eyed damsel? But smile on my suit, lady, and the wounded champion shall  have nothing to fear from Front-de-Bœuf, whom else thou mayst mourn for, as in  the hands of one who has never shown compassion.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Save him, for the love of Heaven!&rdquo; said Rowena, her firmness  giving way under terror for her lover&rsquo;s impending fate.          &ldquo;I can&mdash;I will&mdash;it is my purpose,&rdquo; said De Bracy;  &ldquo;for, when Rowena consents to be the bride of De Bracy, who is it shall  dare to put forth a violent hand upon her kinsman&mdash;the son of her  guardian&mdash;the companion of her youth? But it is thy love must buy his  protection. I am not romantic fool enough to further the fortune, or avert the  fate, of one who is likely to be a successful obstacle between me and my  wishes. Use thine influence with me in his behalf, and he is safe,&mdash;refuse  to employ it, Wilfred dies, and thou thyself art not the nearer to  freedom.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thy language,&rdquo; answered Rowena, &ldquo;hath in its indifferent  bluntness something which cannot be reconciled with the horrors it seems to  express. I believe not that thy purpose is so wicked, or thy power so  great.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Flatter thyself, then, with that belief,&rdquo; said De Bracy,  &ldquo;until time shall prove it false. Thy lover lies wounded in this  castle&mdash;thy preferred lover. He is a bar betwixt Front-de-Bœuf and that  which Front-de-Bœuf loves better than either ambition or beauty. What will it  cost beyond the blow of a poniard, or the thrust of a javelin, to silence his  opposition for ever? Nay, were Front-de-Bœuf afraid to justify a deed so open,  let the leech but give his patient a wrong draught&mdash;let the chamberlain,  or the nurse who tends him, but pluck the pillow from his head, and Wilfred in  his present condition, is sped without the effusion of blood. Cedric  also&mdash;&rdquo;          &ldquo;And Cedric also,&rdquo; said Rowena, repeating his words; &ldquo;my  noble&mdash;my generous guardian! I deserved the evil I have encountered, for  forgetting his fate even in that of his son!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Cedric&rsquo;s fate also depends upon thy determination,&rdquo; said De  Bracy; &ldquo;and I leave thee to form it.&rdquo;          Hitherto, Rowena had sustained her part in this trying scene with undismayed  courage, but it was because she had not considered the danger as serious and  imminent. Her disposition was naturally that which physiognomists consider as  proper to fair complexions, mild, timid, and gentle; but it had been tempered,  and, as it were, hardened, by the circumstances of her education. Accustomed to  see the will of all, even of Cedric himself, (sufficiently arbitrary with  others,) give way before her wishes, she had acquired that sort of courage and  self-confidence which arises from the habitual and constant deference of the  circle in which we move. She could scarce conceive the possibility of her will  being opposed, far less that of its being treated with total disregard.          Her haughtiness and habit of domination was, therefore, a fictitious character,  induced over that which was natural to her, and it deserted her when her eyes  were opened to the extent of her own danger, as well as that of her lover and  her guardian; and when she found her will, the slightest expression of which  was wont to command respect and attention, now placed in opposition to that of  a man of a strong, fierce, and determined mind, who possessed the advantage  over her, and was resolved to use it, she quailed before him.          After casting her eyes around, as if to look for the aid which was nowhere to  be found, and after a few broken interjections, she raised her hands to heaven,  and burst into a passion of uncontrolled vexation and sorrow. It was impossible  to see so beautiful a creature in such extremity without feeling for her, and  De Bracy was not unmoved, though he was yet more embarrassed than touched. He  had, in truth, gone too far to recede; and yet, in Rowena&rsquo;s present  condition, she could not be acted on either by argument or threats. He paced  the apartment to and fro, now vainly exhorting the terrified maiden to compose  herself, now hesitating concerning his own line of conduct.          If, thought he, I should be moved by the tears and sorrow of this disconsolate  damsel, what should I reap but the loss of these fair hopes for which I have  encountered so much risk, and the ridicule of Prince John and his jovial  comrades? &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;I feel myself ill  framed for the part which I am playing. I cannot look on so fair a face while  it is disturbed with agony, or on those eyes when they are drowned in tears. I  would she had retained her original haughtiness of disposition, or that I had a  larger share of Front-de-Bœuf&rsquo;s thrice-tempered hardness of  heart!&rdquo;          Agitated by these thoughts, he could only bid the unfortunate Rowena be  comforted, and assure her, that as yet she had no reason for the excess of  despair to which she was now giving way. But in this task of consolation De  Bracy was interrupted by the horn, &ldquo;hoarse-winded blowing far and  keen,&rdquo; which had at the same time alarmed the other inmates of the  castle, and interrupted their several plans of avarice and of license. Of them  all, perhaps, De Bracy least regretted the interruption; for his conference  with the Lady Rowena had arrived at a point, where he found it equally  difficult to prosecute or to resign his enterprise.          And here we cannot but think it necessary to offer some better proof than the  incidents of an idle tale, to vindicate the melancholy representation of  manners which has been just laid before the reader. It is grievous to think  that those valiant barons, to whose stand against the crown the liberties of  England were indebted for their existence, should themselves have been such  dreadful oppressors, and capable of excesses contrary not only to the laws of  England, but to those of nature and humanity. But, alas! we have only to  extract from the industrious Henry one of those numerous passages which he has  collected from contemporary historians, to prove that fiction itself can hardly  reach the dark reality of the horrors of the period.          The description given by the author of the Saxon Chronicle of the cruelties  exercised in the reign of King Stephen by the great barons and lords of  castles, who were all Normans, affords a strong proof of the excesses of which  they were capable when their passions were inflamed. &ldquo;They grievously  oppressed the poor people by building castles; and when they were built, they  filled them with wicked men, or rather devils, who seized both men and women  who they imagined had any money, threw them into prison, and put them to more  cruel tortures than the martyrs ever endured. They suffocated some in mud, and  suspended others by the feet, or the head, or the thumbs, kindling fires below  them. They squeezed the heads of some with knotted cords till they pierced  their brains, while they threw others into dungeons swarming with serpents,  snakes, and toads.&rdquo; But it would be cruel to put the reader to the pain  of perusing the remainder of this description.   29            As another instance of these bitter fruits of conquest, and perhaps the  strongest that can be quoted, we may mention, that the Princess Matilda, though  a daughter of the King of Scotland, and afterwards both Queen of England, niece  to Edgar Atheling, and mother to the Empress of Germany, the daughter, the  wife, and the mother of monarchs, was obliged, during her early residence for  education in England, to assume the veil of a nun, as the only means of  escaping the licentious pursuit of the Norman nobles. This excuse she stated  before a great council of the clergy of England, as the sole reason for her  having taken the religious habit. The assembled clergy admitted the validity of  the plea, and the notoriety of the circumstances upon which it was founded;  giving thus an indubitable and most remarkable testimony to the existence of  that disgraceful license by which that age was stained. It was a matter of  public knowledge, they said, that after the conquest of King William, his  Norman followers, elated by so great a victory, acknowledged no law but their  own wicked pleasure, and not only despoiled the conquered Saxons of their lands  and their goods, but invaded the honour of their wives and of their daughters  with the most unbridled license; and hence it was then common for matrons and  maidens of noble families to assume the veil, and take shelter in convents, not  as called thither by the vocation of God, but solely to preserve their honour  from the unbridled wickedness of man.          Such and so licentious were the times, as announced by the public declaration  of the assembled clergy, recorded by Eadmer; and we need add nothing more to  vindicate the probability of the scenes which we have detailed, and are about  to detail, upon the more apocryphal authority of the Wardour MS.                     CHAPTER XXIV        I&rsquo;ll woo her as the lion woos his bride.          D OUGLAS           While the scenes we have described were passing in other parts of the castle,  the Jewess Rebecca awaited her fate in a distant and sequestered turret. Hither  she had been led by two of her disguised ravishers, and on being thrust into  the little cell, she found herself in the presence of an old sibyl, who kept  murmuring to herself a Saxon rhyme, as if to beat time to the revolving dance  which her spindle was performing upon the floor. The hag raised her head as  Rebecca entered, and scowled at the fair Jewess with the malignant envy with  which old age and ugliness, when united with evil conditions, are apt to look  upon youth and beauty.          &ldquo;Thou must up and away, old house-cricket,&rdquo; said one of the men;  &ldquo;our noble master commands it&mdash;Thou must e&rsquo;en leave this  chamber to a fairer guest.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; grumbled the hag, &ldquo;even thus is service requited. I  have known when my bare word would have cast the best man-at-arms among ye out  of saddle and out of service; and now must I up and away at the command of  every groom such as thou.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Good Dame Urfried,&rdquo; said the other man, &ldquo;stand not to reason  on it, but up and away. Lords&rsquo; hests must be listened to with a quick  ear. Thou hast had thy day, old dame, but thy sun has long been set. Thou art  now the very emblem of an old war-horse turned out on the barren  heath&mdash;thou hast had thy paces in thy time, but now a broken amble is the  best of them&mdash;Come, amble off with thee.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ill omens dog ye both!&rdquo; said the old woman; &ldquo;and a kennel be  your burying-place! May the evil demon Zernebock tear me limb from limb, if I  leave my own cell ere I have spun out the hemp on my distaff!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Answer it to our lord, then, old housefiend,&rdquo; said the man, and  retired; leaving Rebecca in company with the old woman, upon whose presence she  had been thus unwillingly forced.          &ldquo;What devil&rsquo;s deed have they now in the wind?&rdquo; said the old  hag, murmuring to herself, yet from time to time casting a sidelong and  malignant glance at Rebecca; &ldquo;but it is easy to guess&mdash;Bright eyes,  black locks, and a skin like paper, ere the priest stains it with his black  unguent&mdash;Ay, it is easy to guess why they send her to this lone turret,  whence a shriek could no more be heard than at the depth of five hundred  fathoms beneath the earth.&mdash;Thou wilt have owls for thy neighbours, fair  one; and their screams will be heard as far, and as much regarded, as thine  own. Outlandish, too,&rdquo; she said, marking the dress and turban of  Rebecca&mdash;&ldquo;What country art thou of?&mdash;a Saracen? or an  Egyptian?&mdash;Why dost not answer?&mdash;thou canst weep, canst thou not  speak?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Be not angry, good mother,&rdquo; said Rebecca.          &ldquo;Thou needst say no more,&rdquo; replied Urfried &ldquo;men know a fox by  the train, and a Jewess by her tongue.&rdquo;          &ldquo;For the sake of mercy,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;tell me what I am to  expect as the conclusion of the violence which hath dragged me hither! Is it my  life they seek, to atone for my religion? I will lay it down cheerfully.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thy life, minion?&rdquo; answered the sibyl; &ldquo;what would taking  thy life pleasure them?&mdash;Trust me, thy life is in no peril. Such usage  shalt thou have as was once thought good enough for a noble Saxon maiden. And  shall a Jewess, like thee, repine because she hath no better? Look at  me&mdash;I was as young and twice as fair as thou, when Front-de-Bœuf, father  of this Reginald, and his Normans, stormed this castle. My father and his seven  sons defended their inheritance from story to story, from chamber to  chamber&mdash;There was not a room, not a step of the stair, that was not  slippery with their blood. They died&mdash;they died every man; and ere their  bodies were cold, and ere their blood was dried, I had become the prey and the  scorn of the conqueror!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Is there no help?&mdash;Are there no means of escape?&rdquo; said  Rebecca&mdash;&ldquo;Richly, richly would I requite thine aid.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Think not of it,&rdquo; said the hag; &ldquo;from hence there is no  escape but through the gates of death; and it is late, late,&rdquo; she added,  shaking her grey head, &ldquo;ere these open to us&mdash;Yet it is comfort to  think that we leave behind us on earth those who shall be wretched as  ourselves. Fare thee well, Jewess!&mdash;Jew or Gentile, thy fate would be the  same; for thou hast to do with them that have neither scruple nor pity. Fare  thee well, I say. My thread is spun out&mdash;thy task is yet to begin.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Stay! stay! for Heaven&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; said Rebecca; &ldquo;stay,  though it be to curse and to revile me&mdash;thy presence is yet some  protection.&rdquo;          &ldquo;The presence of the mother of God were no protection,&rdquo; answered  the old woman. &ldquo;There she stands,&rdquo; pointing to a rude image of the  Virgin Mary, &ldquo;see if she can avert the fate that awaits thee.&rdquo;          She left the room as she spoke, her features writhed into a sort of sneering  laugh, which made them seem even more hideous than their habitual frown. She  locked the door behind her, and Rebecca might hear her curse every step for its  steepness, as slowly and with difficulty she descended the turret-stair.          Rebecca was now to expect a fate even more dreadful than that of Rowena; for  what probability was there that either softness or ceremony would be used  towards one of her oppressed race, whatever shadow of these might be preserved  towards a Saxon heiress? Yet had the Jewess this advantage, that she was better  prepared by habits of thought, and by natural strength of mind, to encounter  the dangers to which she was exposed. Of a strong and observing character, even  from her earliest years, the pomp and wealth which her father displayed within  his walls, or which she witnessed in the houses of other wealthy Hebrews, had  not been able to blind her to the precarious circumstances under which they  were enjoyed. Like Damocles at his celebrated banquet, Rebecca perpetually  beheld, amid that gorgeous display, the sword which was suspended over the  heads of her people by a single hair. These reflections had tamed and brought  down to a pitch of sounder judgment a temper, which, under other circumstances,  might have waxed haughty, supercilious, and obstinate.          From her father&rsquo;s example and injunctions, Rebecca had learnt to bear  herself courteously towards all who approached her. She could not indeed  imitate his excess of subservience, because she was a stranger to the meanness  of mind, and to the constant state of timid apprehension, by which it was  dictated; but she bore herself with a proud humility, as if submitting to the  evil circumstances in which she was placed as the daughter of a despised race,  while she felt in her mind the consciousness that she was entitled to hold a  higher rank from her merit, than the arbitrary despotism of religious prejudice  permitted her to aspire to.          Thus prepared to expect adverse circumstances, she had acquired the firmness  necessary for acting under them. Her present situation required all her  presence of mind, and she summoned it up accordingly.          Her first care was to inspect the apartment; but it afforded few hopes either  of escape or protection. It contained neither secret passage nor trap-door, and  unless where the door by which she had entered joined the main building, seemed  to be circumscribed by the round exterior wall of the turret. The door had no  inside bolt or bar. The single window opened upon an embattled space  surmounting the turret, which gave Rebecca, at first sight, some hopes of  escaping; but she soon found it had no communication with any other part of the  battlements, being an isolated bartisan, or balcony, secured, as usual, by a  parapet, with embrasures, at which a few archers might be stationed for  defending the turret, and flanking with their shot the wall of the castle on  that side.          There was therefore no hope but in passive fortitude, and in that strong  reliance on Heaven natural to great and generous characters. Rebecca, however  erroneously taught to interpret the promises of Scripture to the chosen people  of Heaven, did not err in supposing the present to be their hour of trial, or  in trusting that the children of Zion would be one day called in with the  fulness of the Gentiles. In the meanwhile, all around her showed that their  present state was that of punishment and probation, and that it was their  especial duty to suffer without sinning. Thus prepared to consider herself as  the victim of misfortune, Rebecca had early reflected upon her own state, and  schooled her mind to meet the dangers which she had probably to encounter.          The prisoner trembled, however, and changed colour, when a step was heard on  the stair, and the door of the turret-chamber slowly opened, and a tall man,  dressed as one of those banditti to whom they owed their misfortune, slowly  entered, and shut the door behind him; his cap, pulled down upon his brows,  concealed the upper part of his face, and he held his mantle in such a manner  as to muffle the rest. In this guise, as if prepared for the execution of some  deed, at the thought of which he was himself ashamed, he stood before the  affrighted prisoner; yet, ruffian as his dress bespoke him, he seemed at a loss  to express what purpose had brought him thither, so that Rebecca, making an  effort upon herself, had time to anticipate his explanation. She had already  unclasped two costly bracelets and a collar, which she hastened to proffer to  the supposed outlaw, concluding naturally that to gratify his avarice was to  bespeak his favour.          &ldquo;Take these,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;good friend, and for God&rsquo;s  sake be merciful to me and my aged father! These ornaments are of value, yet  are they trifling to what he would bestow to obtain our dismissal from this  castle, free and uninjured.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Fair flower of Palestine,&rdquo; replied the outlaw, &ldquo;these pearls  are orient, but they yield in whiteness to your teeth; the diamonds are  brilliant, but they cannot match your eyes; and ever since I have taken up this  wild trade, I have made a vow to prefer beauty to wealth.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Do not do yourself such wrong,&rdquo; said Rebecca; &ldquo;take ransom,  and have mercy!&mdash;Gold will purchase you pleasure,&mdash;to misuse us,  could only bring thee remorse. My father will willingly satiate thy utmost  wishes; and if thou wilt act wisely, thou mayst purchase with our spoils thy  restoration to civil society&mdash;mayst obtain pardon for past errors, and be  placed beyond the necessity of committing more.&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is well spoken,&rdquo; replied the outlaw in French, finding it  difficult probably to sustain, in Saxon, a conversation which Rebecca had  opened in that language; &ldquo;but know, bright lily of the vale of Baca! that  thy father is already in the hands of a powerful alchemist, who knows how to  convert into gold and silver even the rusty bars of a dungeon grate. The  venerable Isaac is subjected to an alembic, which will distil from him all he  holds dear, without any assistance from my requests or thy entreaty. The ransom  must be paid by love and beauty, and in no other coin will I accept it.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou art no outlaw,&rdquo; said Rebecca, in the same language in which  he addressed her; &ldquo;no outlaw had refused such offers. No outlaw in this  land uses the dialect in which thou hast spoken. Thou art no outlaw, but a  Norman&mdash;a Norman, noble perhaps in birth&mdash;O, be so in thy actions,  and cast off this fearful mask of outrage and violence!&rdquo;          &ldquo;And thou, who canst guess so truly,&rdquo; said Brian de Bois-Guilbert,  dropping the mantle from his face, &ldquo;art no true daughter of Israel, but  in all, save youth and beauty, a very witch of Endor. I am not an outlaw, then,  fair rose of Sharon. And I am one who will be more prompt to hang thy neck and  arms with pearls and diamonds, which so well become them, than to deprive thee  of these ornaments.&rdquo;          &ldquo;What wouldst thou have of me,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;if not my  wealth?&mdash;We can have nought in common between us&mdash;you are a  Christian&mdash;I am a Jewess.&mdash;Our union were contrary to the laws, alike  of the church and the synagogue.&rdquo;          &ldquo;It were so, indeed,&rdquo; replied the Templar, laughing; &ldquo;wed  with a Jewess? &lsquo;Despardieux!&rsquo;&mdash;Not if she were the Queen of  Sheba! And know, besides, sweet daughter of Zion, that were the most Christian  king to offer me his most Christian daughter, with Languedoc for a dowery, I  could not wed her. It is against my vow to love any maiden, otherwise than  &lsquo;par amours&rsquo;, as I will love thee. I am a Templar. Behold the cross  of my Holy Order.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Darest thou appeal to it,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;on an occasion  like the present?&rdquo;          &ldquo;And if I do so,&rdquo; said the Templar, &ldquo;it concerns not thee,  who art no believer in the blessed sign of our salvation.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I believe as my fathers taught,&rdquo; said Rebecca; &ldquo;and may God  forgive my belief if erroneous! But you, Sir Knight, what is yours, when you  appeal without scruple to that which you deem most holy, even while you are  about to transgress the most solemn of your vows as a knight, and as a man of  religion?&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is gravely and well preached, O daughter of Sirach!&rdquo; answered  the Templar; &ldquo;but, gentle Ecclesiastics, thy narrow Jewish prejudices  make thee blind to our high privilege. Marriage were an enduring crime on the  part of a Templar; but what lesser folly I may practise, I shall speedily be  absolved from at the next Preceptory of our Order. Not the wisest of monarchs,  not his father, whose examples you must needs allow are weighty, claimed wider  privileges than we poor soldiers of the Temple of Zion have won by our zeal in  its defence. The protectors of Solomon&rsquo;s Temple may claim license by the  example of Solomon.&rdquo;          &ldquo;If thou readest the Scripture,&rdquo; said the Jewess, &ldquo;and the  lives of the saints, only to justify thine own license and profligacy, thy  crime is like that of him who extracts poison from the most healthful and  necessary herbs.&rdquo;          The eyes of the Templar flashed fire at this  reproof&mdash;&ldquo;Hearken,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Rebecca; I have hitherto  spoken mildly to thee, but now my language shall be that of a conqueror. Thou  art the captive of my bow and spear&mdash;subject to my will by the laws of all  nations; nor will I abate an inch of my right, or abstain from taking by  violence what thou refusest to entreaty or necessity.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Stand back,&rdquo; said Rebecca&mdash;&ldquo;stand back, and hear me ere  thou offerest to commit a sin so deadly! My strength thou mayst indeed  overpower for God made women weak, and trusted their defence to man&rsquo;s  generosity. But I will proclaim thy villainy, Templar, from one end of Europe  to the other. I will owe to the superstition of thy brethren what their  compassion might refuse me, Each Preceptory&mdash;each Chapter of thy Order,  shall learn, that, like a heretic, thou hast sinned with a Jewess. Those who  tremble not at thy crime, will hold thee accursed for having so far dishonoured  the cross thou wearest, as to follow a daughter of my people.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou art keen-witted, Jewess,&rdquo; replied the Templar, well aware of  the truth of what she spoke, and that the rules of his Order condemned in the  most positive manner, and under high penalties, such intrigues as he now  prosecuted, and that, in some instances, even degradation had followed upon  it&mdash;&ldquo;thou art sharp-witted,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but loud must be  thy voice of complaint, if it is heard beyond the iron walls of this castle;  within these, murmurs, laments, appeals to justice, and screams for help, die  alike silent away. One thing only can save thee, Rebecca. Submit to thy  fate&mdash;embrace our religion, and thou shalt go forth in such state, that  many a Norman lady shall yield as well in pomp as in beauty to the favourite of  the best lance among the defenders of the Temple.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Submit to my fate!&rdquo; said Rebecca&mdash;&ldquo;and, sacred Heaven!  to what fate?&mdash;embrace thy religion! and what religion can it be that  harbours such a villain?&mdash;THOU the best lance of the  Templars!&mdash;Craven knight!&mdash;forsworn priest! I spit at thee, and I  defy thee.&mdash;The God of Abraham&rsquo;s promise hath opened an escape to  his daughter&mdash;even from this abyss of infamy!&rdquo;          As she spoke, she threw open the latticed window which led to the bartisan, and  in an instant after, stood on the very verge of the parapet, with not the  slightest screen between her and the tremendous depth below. Unprepared for  such a desperate effort, for she had hitherto stood perfectly motionless,  Bois-Guilbert had neither time to intercept nor to stop her. As he offered to  advance, she exclaimed, &ldquo;Remain where thou art, proud Templar, or at thy  choice advance!&mdash;one foot nearer, and I plunge myself from the precipice;  my body shall be crushed out of the very form of humanity upon the stones of  that court-yard, ere it become the victim of thy brutality!&rdquo;          As she spoke this, she clasped her hands and extended them towards heaven, as  if imploring mercy on her soul before she made the final plunge. The Templar  hesitated, and a resolution which had never yielded to pity or distress, gave  way to his admiration of her fortitude. &ldquo;Come down,&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;rash girl!&mdash;I swear by earth, and sea, and sky, I will offer thee  no offence.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I will not trust thee, Templar,&rdquo; said Rebecca; &ldquo;thou hast  taught me better how to estimate the virtues of thine Order. The next  Preceptory would grant thee absolution for an oath, the keeping of which  concerned nought but the honour or the dishonour of a miserable Jewish  maiden.&rdquo;          &ldquo;You do me injustice,&rdquo; exclaimed the Templar fervently; &ldquo;I  swear to you by the name which I bear&mdash;by the cross on my bosom&mdash;by  the sword on my side&mdash;by the ancient crest of my fathers do I swear, I  will do thee no injury whatsoever! If not for thyself, yet for thy  father&rsquo;s sake forbear! I will be his friend, and in this castle he will  need a powerful one.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;I know it but too well&mdash;dare I  trust thee?&rdquo;          &ldquo;May my arms be reversed, and my name dishonoured,&rdquo; said Brian de  Bois-Guilbert, &ldquo;if thou shalt have reason to complain of me! Many a law,  many a commandment have I broken, but my word never.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I will then trust thee,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;thus far;&rdquo; and  she descended from the verge of the battlement, but remained standing close by  one of the embrasures, or &ldquo;machicolles&rdquo;, as they were then  called.&mdash;&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I take my stand. Remain  where thou art, and if thou shalt attempt to diminish by one step the distance  now between us, thou shalt see that the Jewish maiden will rather trust her  soul with God, than her honour to the Templar!&rdquo;          While Rebecca spoke thus, her high and firm resolve, which corresponded so well  with the expressive beauty of her countenance, gave to her looks, air, and  manner, a dignity that seemed more than mortal. Her glance quailed not, her  cheek blanched not, for the fear of a fate so instant and so horrible; on the  contrary, the thought that she had her fate at her command, and could escape at  will from infamy to death, gave a yet deeper colour of carnation to her  complexion, and a yet more brilliant fire to her eye. Bois-Guilbert, proud  himself and high-spirited, thought he had never beheld beauty so animated and  so commanding.          &ldquo;Let there be peace between us, Rebecca,&rdquo; he said.          &ldquo;Peace, if thou wilt,&rdquo; answered  Rebecca&mdash;&ldquo;Peace&mdash;but with this space between.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou needst no longer fear me,&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert.          &ldquo;I fear thee not,&rdquo; replied she; &ldquo;thanks to him that reared  this dizzy tower so high, that nought could fall from it and live&mdash;thanks  to him, and to the God of Israel!&mdash;I fear thee not.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou dost me injustice,&rdquo; said the Templar; &ldquo;by earth, sea,  and sky, thou dost me injustice! I am not naturally that which you have seen  me, hard, selfish, and relentless. It was woman that taught me cruelty, and on  woman therefore I have exercised it; but not upon such as thou. Hear me,  Rebecca&mdash;Never did knight take lance in his hand with a heart more devoted  to the lady of his love than Brian de Bois-Guilbert. She, the daughter of a  petty baron, who boasted for all his domains but a ruinous tower, and an  unproductive vineyard, and some few leagues of the barren Landes of Bourdeaux,  her name was known wherever deeds of arms were done, known wider than that of  many a lady&rsquo;s that had a county for a dowery.&mdash;Yes,&rdquo; he  continued, pacing up and down the little platform, with an animation in which  he seemed to lose all consciousness of Rebecca&rsquo;s  presence&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, my deeds, my danger, my blood, made the name of  Adelaide de Montemare known from the court of Castile to that of Byzantium. And  how was I requited?&mdash;When I returned with my dear-bought honours,  purchased by toil and blood, I found her wedded to a Gascon squire, whose name  was never heard beyond the limits of his own paltry domain! Truly did I love  her, and bitterly did I revenge me of her broken faith! But my vengeance has  recoiled on myself. Since that day I have separated myself from life and its  ties&mdash;My manhood must know no domestic home&mdash;must be soothed by no  affectionate wife&mdash;My age must know no kindly hearth&mdash;My grave must  be solitary, and no offspring must outlive me, to bear the ancient name of  Bois-Guilbert. At the feet of my Superior I have laid down the right of  self-action&mdash;the privilege of independence. The Templar, a serf in all but  the name, can possess neither lands nor goods, and lives, moves, and breathes,  but at the will and pleasure of another.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;what advantages could compensate for  such an absolute sacrifice?&rdquo;          &ldquo;The power of vengeance, Rebecca,&rdquo; replied the Templar, &ldquo;and  the prospects of ambition.&rdquo;          &ldquo;An evil recompense,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;for the surrender of the  rights which are dearest to humanity.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Say not so, maiden,&rdquo; answered the Templar; &ldquo;revenge is a  feast for the gods! And if they have reserved it, as priests tell us, to  themselves, it is because they hold it an enjoyment too precious for the  possession of mere mortals.&mdash;And ambition? it is a temptation which could  disturb even the bliss of heaven itself.&rdquo;&mdash;He paused a moment, and  then added, &ldquo;Rebecca! she who could prefer death to dishonour, must have  a proud and a powerful soul. Mine thou must be!&mdash;Nay, start not,&rdquo; he  added, &ldquo;it must be with thine own consent, and on thine own terms. Thou  must consent to share with me hopes more extended than can be viewed from the  throne of a monarch!&mdash;Hear me ere you answer and judge ere you  refuse.&mdash;The Templar loses, as thou hast said, his social rights, his  power of free agency, but he becomes a member and a limb of a mighty body,  before which thrones already tremble,&mdash;even as the single drop of rain  which mixes with the sea becomes an individual part of that resistless ocean,  which undermines rocks and ingulfs royal armadas. Such a swelling flood is that  powerful league. Of this mighty Order I am no mean member, but already one of  the Chief Commanders, and may well aspire one day to hold the batoon of Grand  Master. The poor soldiers of the Temple will not alone place their foot upon  the necks of kings&mdash;a hemp-sandall&rsquo;d monk can do that. Our mailed  step shall ascend their throne&mdash;our gauntlet shall wrench the sceptre from  their gripe. Not the reign of your vainly-expected Messiah offers such power to  your dispersed tribes as my ambition may aim at. I have sought but a kindred  spirit to share it, and I have found such in thee.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Sayest thou this to one of my people?&rdquo; answered Rebecca.  &ldquo;Bethink thee&mdash;&rdquo;          &ldquo;Answer me not,&rdquo; said the Templar, &ldquo;by urging the difference  of our creeds; within our secret conclaves we hold these nursery tales in  derision. Think not we long remained blind to the idiotical folly of our  founders, who forswore every delight of life for the pleasure of dying martyrs  by hunger, by thirst, and by pestilence, and by the swords of savages, while  they vainly strove to defend a barren desert, valuable only in the eyes of  superstition. Our Order soon adopted bolder and wider views, and found out a  better indemnification for our sacrifices. Our immense possessions in every  kingdom of Europe, our high military fame, which brings within our circle the  flower of chivalry from every Christian clime&mdash;these are dedicated to ends  of which our pious founders little dreamed, and which are equally concealed  from such weak spirits as embrace our Order on the ancient principles, and  whose superstition makes them our passive tools. But I will not further  withdraw the veil of our mysteries. That bugle-sound announces something which  may require my presence. Think on what I have said.&mdash;Farewell!&mdash;I do  not say forgive me the violence I have threatened, for it was necessary to the  display of thy character. Gold can be only known by the application of the  touchstone. I will soon return, and hold further conference with thee.&rdquo;          He re-entered the turret-chamber, and descended the stair, leaving Rebecca  scarcely more terrified at the prospect of the death to which she had been so  lately exposed, than at the furious ambition of the bold bad man in whose power  she found herself so unhappily placed. When she entered the turret-chamber, her  first duty was to return thanks to the God of Jacob for the protection which he  had afforded her, and to implore its continuance for her and for her father.  Another name glided into her petition&mdash;it was that of the wounded  Christian, whom fate had placed in the hands of bloodthirsty men, his avowed  enemies. Her heart indeed checked her, as if, even in communing with the Deity  in prayer, she mingled in her devotions the recollection of one with whose fate  hers could have no alliance&mdash;a Nazarene, and an enemy to her faith. But  the petition was already breathed, nor could all the narrow prejudices of her  sect induce Rebecca to wish it recalled.                     CHAPTER XXV        A damn&rsquo;d cramp piece of penmanship as ever I saw in my life!          S HE  S TOOPS TO  C ONQUER           When the Templar reached the hall of the castle, he found De Bracy already  there. &ldquo;Your love-suit,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;hath, I suppose,  been disturbed, like mine, by this obstreperous summons. But you have come  later and more reluctantly, and therefore I presume your interview has proved  more agreeable than mine.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Has your suit, then, been unsuccessfully paid to the Saxon  heiress?&rdquo; said the Templar.          &ldquo;By the bones of Thomas a Becket,&rdquo; answered De Bracy, &ldquo;the  Lady Rowena must have heard that I cannot endure the sight of women&rsquo;s  tears.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Away!&rdquo; said the Templar; &ldquo;thou a leader of a Free Company,  and regard a woman&rsquo;s tears! A few drops sprinkled on the torch of love,  make the flame blaze the brighter.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Gramercy for the few drops of thy sprinkling,&rdquo; replied De Bracy;  &ldquo;but this damsel hath wept enough to extinguish a beacon-light. Never was  such wringing of hands and such overflowing of eyes, since the days of St  Niobe, of whom Prior Aymer told us.   30   A water-fiend  hath possessed the fair Saxon.&rdquo;          &ldquo;A legion of fiends have occupied the bosom of the Jewess,&rdquo; replied  the Templar; &ldquo;for, I think no single one, not even Apollyon himself,  could have inspired such indomitable pride and resolution.&mdash;But where is  Front-de-Bœuf? That horn is sounded more and more clamorously.&rdquo;          &ldquo;He is negotiating with the Jew, I suppose,&rdquo; replied De Bracy,  coolly; &ldquo;probably the howls of Isaac have drowned the blast of the bugle.  Thou mayst know, by experience, Sir Brian, that a Jew parting with his  treasures on such terms as our friend Front-de-Bœuf is like to offer, will  raise a clamour loud enough to be heard over twenty horns and trumpets to boot.  But we will make the vassals call him.&rdquo;          They were soon after joined by Front-de-Bœuf, who had been disturbed in his  tyrannic cruelty in the manner with which the reader is acquainted, and had  only tarried to give some necessary directions.          &ldquo;Let us see the cause of this cursed clamour,&rdquo; said  Front-de-Bœuf&mdash;&ldquo;here is a letter, and, if I mistake not, it is in  Saxon.&rdquo;          He looked at it, turning it round and round as if he had had really some hopes  of coming at the meaning by inverting the position of the paper, and then  handed it to De Bracy.          &ldquo;It may be magic spells for aught I know,&rdquo; said De Bracy, who  possessed his full proportion of the ignorance which characterised the chivalry  of the period. &ldquo;Our chaplain attempted to teach me to write,&rdquo; he  said, &ldquo;but all my letters were formed like spear-heads and sword-blades,  and so the old shaveling gave up the task.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Give it me,&rdquo; said the Templar. &ldquo;We have that of the priestly  character, that we have some knowledge to enlighten our valour.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Let us profit by your most reverend knowledge, then,&rdquo; said De  Bracy; &ldquo;what says the scroll?&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is a formal letter of defiance,&rdquo; answered the Templar;  &ldquo;but, by our Lady of Bethlehem, if it be not a foolish jest, it is the  most extraordinary cartel that ever was sent across the drawbridge of a  baronial castle.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Jest!&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf, &ldquo;I would gladly know who dares  jest with me in such a matter!&mdash;Read it, Sir Brian.&rdquo;          The Templar accordingly read it as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;I, Wamba, the son of  Witless, Jester to a noble and free-born man, Cedric of Rotherwood, called the  Saxon,&mdash;And I, Gurth, the son of Beowulph, the swineherd&mdash;-&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou art mad,&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf, interrupting the reader.          &ldquo;By St Luke, it is so set down,&rdquo; answered the Templar. Then  resuming his task, he went on,&mdash;&ldquo;I, Gurth, the son of Beowulph,  swineherd unto the said Cedric, with the assistance of our allies and  confederates, who make common cause with us in this our feud, namely, the good  knight, called for the present &lsquo;Le Noir Faineant&rsquo;, and the stout  yeoman, Robert Locksley, called Cleave-the-Wand. Do you, Reginald Front  de-Bœuf, and your allies and accomplices whomsoever, to wit, that whereas you  have, without cause given or feud declared, wrongfully and by mastery seized  upon the person of our lord and master the said Cedric; also upon the person of  a noble and freeborn damsel, the Lady Rowena of Hargottstandstede; also upon  the person of a noble and freeborn man, Athelstane of Coningsburgh; also upon  the persons of certain freeborn men, their &lsquo;cnichts&rsquo;; also upon  certain serfs, their born bondsmen; also upon a certain Jew, named Isaac of  York, together with his daughter, a Jewess, and certain horses and mules: Which  noble persons, with their &lsquo;cnichts&rsquo; and slaves, and also with the  horses and mules, Jew and Jewess beforesaid, were all in peace with his  majesty, and travelling as liege subjects upon the king&rsquo;s highway;  therefore we require and demand that the said noble persons, namely, Cedric of  Rotherwood, Rowena of Hargottstandstede, Athelstane of Coningsburgh, with their  servants, &lsquo;cnichts&rsquo;, and followers, also the horses and mules, Jew  and Jewess aforesaid, together with all goods and chattels to them pertaining,  be, within an hour after the delivery hereof, delivered to us, or to those whom  we shall appoint to receive the same, and that untouched and unharmed in body  and goods. Failing of which, we do pronounce to you, that we hold ye as robbers  and traitors, and will wager our bodies against ye in battle, siege, or  otherwise, and do our utmost to your annoyance and destruction. Wherefore may  God have you in his keeping.&mdash;Signed by us upon the eve of St  Withold&rsquo;s day, under the great trysting oak in the Hart-hill Walk, the  above being written by a holy man, Clerk to God, our Lady, and St Dunstan, in  the Chapel of Copmanhurst.&rdquo;          At the bottom of this document was scrawled, in the first place, a rude sketch  of a cock&rsquo;s head and comb, with a legend expressing this hieroglyphic to  be the sign-manual of Wamba, son of Witless. Under this respectable emblem  stood a cross, stated to be the mark of Gurth, the son of Beowulph. Then was  written, in rough bold characters, the words, &ldquo;Le Noir Faineant&rdquo;.  And, to conclude the whole, an arrow, neatly enough drawn, was described as the  mark of the yeoman Locksley.          The knights heard this uncommon document read from end to end, and then gazed  upon each other in silent amazement, as being utterly at a loss to know what it  could portend. De Bracy was the first to break silence by an uncontrollable fit  of laughter, wherein he was joined, though with more moderation, by the  Templar. Front-de-Bœuf, on the contrary, seemed impatient of their ill-timed  jocularity.          &ldquo;I give you plain warning,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;fair sirs, that you had  better consult how to bear yourselves under these circumstances, than give way  to such misplaced merriment.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Front-de-Bœuf has not recovered his temper since his late  overthrow,&rdquo; said De Bracy to the Templar; &ldquo;he is cowed at the very  idea of a cartel, though it come but from a fool and a swineherd.&rdquo;          &ldquo;By St Michael,&rdquo; answered Front-de-Bœuf, &ldquo;I would thou  couldst stand the whole brunt of this adventure thyself, De Bracy. These  fellows dared not have acted with such inconceivable impudence, had they not  been supported by some strong bands. There are enough of outlaws in this forest  to resent my protecting the deer. I did but tie one fellow, who was taken  redhanded and in the fact, to the horns of a wild stag, which gored him to  death in five minutes, and I had as many arrows shot at me as there were  launched against yonder target at Ashby.&mdash;Here, fellow,&rdquo; he added,  to one of his attendants, &ldquo;hast thou sent out to see by what force this  precious challenge is to be supported?&rdquo;          &ldquo;There are at least two hundred men assembled in the woods,&rdquo;  answered a squire who was in attendance.          &ldquo;Here is a proper matter!&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf, &ldquo;this comes  of lending you the use of my castle, that cannot manage your undertaking  quietly, but you must bring this nest of hornets about my ears!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Of hornets?&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;of stingless drones rather; a  band of lazy knaves, who take to the wood, and destroy the venison rather than  labour for their maintenance.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Stingless!&rdquo; replied Front-de-Bœuf; &ldquo;fork-headed shafts of a  cloth-yard in length, and these shot within the breadth of a French crown, are  sting enough.&rdquo;          &ldquo;For shame, Sir Knight!&rdquo; said the Templar. &ldquo;Let us summon our  people, and sally forth upon them. One knight&mdash;ay, one man-at-arms, were  enough for twenty such peasants.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Enough, and too much,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;I should only be  ashamed to couch lance against them.&rdquo;          &ldquo;True,&rdquo; answered Front-de-Bœuf; &ldquo;were they black Turks or  Moors, Sir Templar, or the craven peasants of France, most valiant De Bracy;  but these are English yeomen, over whom we shall have no advantage, save what  we may derive from our arms and horses, which will avail us little in the  glades of the forest. Sally, saidst thou? we have scarce men enough to defend  the castle. The best of mine are at York; so is all your band, De Bracy; and we  have scarcely twenty, besides the handful that were engaged in this mad  business.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou dost not fear,&rdquo; said the Templar, &ldquo;that they can  assemble in force sufficient to attempt the castle?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Not so, Sir Brian,&rdquo; answered Front-de-Bœuf. &ldquo;These outlaws  have indeed a daring captain; but without machines, scaling ladders, and  experienced leaders, my castle may defy them.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Send to thy neighbours,&rdquo; said the Templar, &ldquo;let them  assemble their people, and come to the rescue of three knights, besieged by a  jester and a swineherd in the baronial castle of Reginald  Front-de-Bœuf!&rdquo;          &ldquo;You jest, Sir Knight,&rdquo; answered the baron; &ldquo;but to whom  should I send?&mdash;Malvoisin is by this time at York with his retainers, and  so are my other allies; and so should I have been, but for this infernal  enterprise.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Then send to York, and recall our people,&rdquo; said De Bracy.  &ldquo;If they abide the shaking of my standard, or the sight of my Free  Companions, I will give them credit for the boldest outlaws ever bent bow in  green-wood.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And who shall bear such a message?&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf;  &ldquo;they will beset every path, and rip the errand out of his bosom.&mdash;I  have it,&rdquo; he added, after pausing for a moment&mdash;&ldquo;Sir Templar,  thou canst write as well as read, and if we can but find the writing materials  of my chaplain, who died a twelvemonth since in the midst of his Christmas  carousals&mdash;&rdquo;          &ldquo;So please ye,&rdquo; said the squire, who was still in attendance,  &ldquo;I think old Urfried has them somewhere in keeping, for love of the  confessor. He was the last man, I have heard her tell, who ever said aught to  her, which man ought in courtesy to address to maid or matron.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Go, search them out, Engelred,&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf; &ldquo;and  then, Sir Templar, thou shalt return an answer to this bold challenge.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I would rather do it at the sword&rsquo;s point than at that of the  pen,&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert; &ldquo;but be it as you will.&rdquo;          He sat down accordingly, and indited, in the French language, an epistle of the  following tenor:&mdash;&ldquo;Sir Reginald Front-de-Bœuf, with his noble and  knightly allies and confederates, receive no defiances at the hands of slaves,  bondsmen, or fugitives. If the person calling himself the Black Knight have  indeed a claim to the honours of chivalry, he ought to know that he stands  degraded by his present association, and has no right to ask reckoning at the  hands of good men of noble blood. Touching the prisoners we have made, we do in  Christian charity require you to send a man of religion, to receive their  confession, and reconcile them with God; since it is our fixed intention to  execute them this morning before noon, so that their heads being placed on the  battlements, shall show to all men how lightly we esteem those who have  bestirred themselves in their rescue. Wherefore, as above, we require you to  send a priest to reconcile them to God, in doing which you shall render them  the last earthly service.&rdquo;          This letter being folded, was delivered to the squire, and by him to the  messenger who waited without, as the answer to that which he had brought.          The yeoman having thus accomplished his mission, returned to the head-quarters  of the allies, which were for the present established under a venerable  oak-tree, about three arrow-flights distant from the castle. Here Wamba and  Gurth, with their allies the Black Knight and Locksley, and the jovial hermit,  awaited with impatience an answer to their summons. Around, and at a distance  from them, were seen many a bold yeoman, whose silvan dress and weatherbeaten  countenances showed the ordinary nature of their occupation. More than two  hundred had already assembled, and others were fast coming in. Those whom they  obeyed as leaders were only distinguished from the others by a feather in the  cap, their dress, arms, and equipments being in all other respects the same.          Besides these bands, a less orderly and a worse armed force, consisting of the  Saxon inhabitants of the neighbouring township, as well as many bondsmen and  servants from Cedric&rsquo;s extensive estate, had already arrived, for the  purpose of assisting in his rescue. Few of these were armed otherwise than with  such rustic weapons as necessity sometimes converts to military purposes.  Boar-spears, scythes, flails, and the like, were their chief arms; for the  Normans, with the usual policy of conquerors, were jealous of permitting to the  vanquished Saxons the possession or the use of swords and spears. These  circumstances rendered the assistance of the Saxons far from being so  formidable to the besieged, as the strength of the men themselves, their  superior numbers, and the animation inspired by a just cause, might otherwise  well have made them. It was to the leaders of this motley army that the letter  of the Templar was now delivered.          Reference was at first made to the chaplain for an exposition of its contents.          &ldquo;By the crook of St Dunstan,&rdquo; said that worthy ecclesiastic,  &ldquo;which hath brought more sheep within the sheepfold than the crook of  e&rsquo;er another saint in Paradise, I swear that I cannot expound unto you  this jargon, which, whether it be French or Arabic, is beyond my guess.&rdquo;          He then gave the letter to Gurth, who shook his head gruffly, and passed it to  Wamba. The Jester looked at each of the four corners of the paper with such a  grin of affected intelligence as a monkey is apt to assume upon similar  occasions, then cut a caper, and gave the letter to Locksley.          &ldquo;If the long letters were bows, and the short letters broad arrows, I  might know something of the matter,&rdquo; said the brave yeoman; &ldquo;but as  the matter stands, the meaning is as safe, for me, as the stag that&rsquo;s at  twelve miles distance.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I must be clerk, then,&rdquo; said the Black Knight; and taking the  letter from Locksley, he first read it over to himself, and then explained the  meaning in Saxon to his confederates.          &ldquo;Execute the noble Cedric!&rdquo; exclaimed Wamba; &ldquo;by the rood,  thou must be mistaken, Sir Knight.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Not I, my worthy friend,&rdquo; replied the knight, &ldquo;I have  explained the words as they are here set down.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Then, by St Thomas of Canterbury,&rdquo; replied Gurth, &ldquo;we will  have the castle, should we tear it down with our hands!&rdquo;          &ldquo;We have nothing else to tear it with,&rdquo; replied Wamba; &ldquo;but  mine are scarce fit to make mammocks of freestone and mortar.&rdquo;          &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis but a contrivance to gain time,&rdquo; said Locksley;  &ldquo;they dare not do a deed for which I could exact a fearful  penalty.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I would,&rdquo; said the Black Knight, &ldquo;there were some one among  us who could obtain admission into the castle, and discover how the case stands  with the besieged. Methinks, as they require a confessor to be sent, this holy  hermit might at once exercise his pious vocation, and procure us the  information we desire.&rdquo;          &ldquo;A plague on thee, and thy advice!&rdquo; said the pious hermit; &ldquo;I  tell thee, Sir Slothful Knight, that when I doff my friar&rsquo;s frock, my  priesthood, my sanctity, my very Latin, are put off along with it; and when in  my green jerkin, I can better kill twenty deer than confess one  Christian.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I fear,&rdquo; said the Black Knight, &ldquo;I fear greatly, there is no  one here that is qualified to take upon him, for the nonce, this same character  of father confessor?&rdquo;          All looked on each other, and were silent.          &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Wamba, after a short pause, &ldquo;that the fool must  be still the fool, and put his neck in the venture which wise men shrink from.  You must know, my dear cousins and countrymen, that I wore russet before I wore  motley, and was bred to be a friar, until a brain-fever came upon me and left  me just wit enough to be a fool. I trust, with the assistance of the good  hermit&rsquo;s frock, together with the priesthood, sanctity, and learning  which are stitched into the cowl of it, I shall be found qualified to  administer both worldly and ghostly comfort to our worthy master Cedric, and  his companions in adversity.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Hath he sense enough, thinkst thou?&rdquo; said the Black Knight,  addressing Gurth.          &ldquo;I know not,&rdquo; said Gurth; &ldquo;but if he hath not, it will be the  first time he hath wanted wit to turn his folly to account.&rdquo;          &ldquo;On with the frock, then, good fellow,&rdquo; quoth the Knight,  &ldquo;and let thy master send us an account of their situation within the  castle. Their numbers must be few, and it is five to one they may be accessible  by a sudden and bold attack. Time wears&mdash;away with thee.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And, in the meantime,&rdquo; said Locksley, &ldquo;we will beset the  place so closely, that not so much as a fly shall carry news from thence. So  that, my good friend,&rdquo; he continued, addressing Wamba, &ldquo;thou mayst  assure these tyrants, that whatever violence they exercise on the persons of  their prisoners, shall be most severely repaid upon their own.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Pax vobiscum,&rdquo; said Wamba, who was now muffled in his religious  disguise.          And so saying he imitated the solemn and stately deportment of a friar, and  departed to execute his mission.                     CHAPTER XXVI        The hottest horse will oft be cool,   The dullest will show fire;   The friar will often play the fool,   The fool will play the friar.          O LD  S ONG           When the Jester, arrayed in the cowl and frock of the hermit, and having his  knotted cord twisted round his middle, stood before the portal of the castle of  Front-de-Bœuf, the warder demanded of him his name and errand.          &ldquo;Pax vobiscum,&rdquo; answered the Jester, &ldquo;I am a poor brother of  the Order of St Francis, who come hither to do my office to certain unhappy  prisoners now secured within this castle.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou art a bold friar,&rdquo; said the warder, &ldquo;to come hither,  where, saving our own drunken confessor, a cock of thy feather hath not crowed  these twenty years.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Yet I pray thee, do mine errand to the lord of the castle,&rdquo;  answered the pretended friar; &ldquo;trust me it will find good acceptance with  him, and the cock shall crow, that the whole castle shall hear him.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Gramercy,&rdquo; said the warder; &ldquo;but if I come to shame for  leaving my post upon thine errand, I will try whether a friar&rsquo;s grey gown  be proof against a grey-goose shaft.&rdquo;          With this threat he left his turret, and carried to the hall of the castle his  unwonted intelligence, that a holy friar stood before the gate and demanded  instant admission. With no small wonder he received his master&rsquo;s commands  to admit the holy man immediately; and, having previously manned the entrance  to guard against surprise, he obeyed, without further scruple, the commands  which he had received. The harebrained self-conceit which had emboldened Wamba  to undertake this dangerous office, was scarce sufficient to support him when  he found himself in the presence of a man so dreadful, and so much dreaded, as  Reginald Front-de-Bœuf, and he brought out his &ldquo;pax vobiscum&rdquo;, to  which he, in a good measure, trusted for supporting his character, with more  anxiety and hesitation than had hitherto accompanied it. But Front-de-Bœuf was  accustomed to see men of all ranks tremble in his presence, so that the  timidity of the supposed father did not give him any cause of suspicion.          &ldquo;Who and whence art thou, priest?&rdquo; said he.          &ldquo;&lsquo;Pax vobiscum&rsquo;,&rdquo; reiterated the Jester, &ldquo;I am a  poor servant of St Francis, who, travelling through this wilderness, have  fallen among thieves, (as Scripture hath it,) &lsquo;quidam viator incidit in  latrones&rsquo;, which thieves have sent me unto this castle in order to do my  ghostly office on two persons condemned by your honourable justice.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay, right,&rdquo; answered Front-de-Bœuf; &ldquo;and canst thou tell  me, holy father, the number of those banditti?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Gallant sir,&rdquo; answered the Jester, &ldquo;&lsquo;nomen illis  legio&rsquo;, their name is legion.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Tell me in plain terms what numbers there are, or, priest, thy cloak and  cord will ill protect thee.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the supposed friar, &ldquo;&lsquo;cor meum  eructavit&rsquo;, that is to say, I was like to burst with fear! but I conceive  they may be&mdash;what of yeomen&mdash;what of commons, at least five hundred  men.&rdquo;          &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said the Templar, who came into the hall that moment,  &ldquo;muster the wasps so thick here? it is time to stifle such a mischievous  brood.&rdquo; Then taking Front-de-Bœuf aside &ldquo;Knowest thou the  priest?&rdquo;          &ldquo;He is a stranger from a distant convent,&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf;  &ldquo;I know him not.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Then trust him not with thy purpose in words,&rdquo; answered the  Templar. &ldquo;Let him carry a written order to De Bracy&rsquo;s company of  Free Companions, to repair instantly to their master&rsquo;s aid. In the  meantime, and that the shaveling may suspect nothing, permit him to go freely  about his task of preparing these Saxon hogs for the slaughter-house.&rdquo;          &ldquo;It shall be so,&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf. And he forthwith appointed a  domestic to conduct Wamba to the apartment where Cedric and Athelstane were  confined.          The impatience of Cedric had been rather enhanced than diminished by his  confinement. He walked from one end of the hall to the other, with the attitude  of one who advances to charge an enemy, or to storm the breach of a beleaguered  place, sometimes ejaculating to himself, sometimes addressing Athelstane, who  stoutly and stoically awaited the issue of the adventure, digesting, in the  meantime, with great composure, the liberal meal which he had made at noon, and  not greatly interesting himself about the duration of his captivity, which he  concluded, would, like all earthly evils, find an end in Heaven&rsquo;s good  time.          &ldquo;&lsquo;Pax vobiscum&rsquo;,&rdquo; said the Jester, entering the  apartment; &ldquo;the blessing of St Dunstan, St Dennis, St Duthoc, and all  other saints whatsoever, be upon ye and about ye.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Enter freely,&rdquo; answered Cedric to the supposed friar; &ldquo;with  what intent art thou come hither?&rdquo;          &ldquo;To bid you prepare yourselves for death,&rdquo; answered the Jester.          &ldquo;It is impossible!&rdquo; replied Cedric, starting. &ldquo;Fearless and  wicked as they are, they dare not attempt such open and gratuitous  cruelty!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the Jester, &ldquo;to restrain them by their sense of  humanity, is the same as to stop a runaway horse with a bridle of silk thread.  Bethink thee, therefore, noble Cedric, and you also, gallant Athelstane, what  crimes you have committed in the flesh; for this very day will ye be called to  answer at a higher tribunal.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Hearest thou this, Athelstane?&rdquo; said Cedric; &ldquo;we must rouse  up our hearts to this last action, since better it is we should die like men,  than live like slaves.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; answered Athelstane, &ldquo;to stand the worst of  their malice, and shall walk to my death with as much composure as ever I did  to my dinner.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Let us then unto our holy gear, father,&rdquo; said Cedric.          &ldquo;Wait yet a moment, good uncle,&rdquo; said the Jester, in his natural  tone; &ldquo;better look long before you leap in the dark.&rdquo;          &ldquo;By my faith,&rdquo; said Cedric, &ldquo;I should know that voice!&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is that of your trusty slave and jester,&rdquo; answered Wamba,  throwing back his cowl. &ldquo;Had you taken a fool&rsquo;s advice formerly,  you would not have been here at all. Take a fool&rsquo;s advice now, and you  will not be here long.&rdquo;          &ldquo;How mean&rsquo;st thou, knave?&rdquo; answered the Saxon.          &ldquo;Even thus,&rdquo; replied Wamba; &ldquo;take thou this frock and cord,  which are all the orders I ever had, and march quietly out of the castle,  leaving me your cloak and girdle to take the long leap in thy stead.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Leave thee in my stead!&rdquo; said Cedric, astonished at the proposal;  &ldquo;why, they would hang thee, my poor knave.&rdquo;          &ldquo;E&rsquo;en let them do as they are permitted,&rdquo; said Wamba;  &ldquo;I trust&mdash;no disparagement to your birth&mdash;that the son of  Witless may hang in a chain with as much gravity as the chain hung upon his  ancestor the alderman.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Well, Wamba,&rdquo; answered Cedric, &ldquo;for one thing will I grant  thy request. And that is, if thou wilt make the exchange of garments with Lord  Athelstane instead of me.&rdquo;          &ldquo;No, by St Dunstan,&rdquo; answered Wamba; &ldquo;there were little  reason in that. Good right there is, that the son of Witless should suffer to  save the son of Hereward; but little wisdom there were in his dying for the  benefit of one whose fathers were strangers to his.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Villain,&rdquo; said Cedric, &ldquo;the fathers of Athelstane were  monarchs of England!&rdquo;          &ldquo;They might be whomsoever they pleased,&rdquo; replied Wamba; &ldquo;but  my neck stands too straight upon my shoulders to have it twisted for their  sake. Wherefore, good my master, either take my proffer yourself, or suffer me  to leave this dungeon as free as I entered.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Let the old tree wither,&rdquo; continued Cedric, &ldquo;so the stately  hope of the forest be preserved. Save the noble Athelstane, my trusty Wamba! it  is the duty of each who has Saxon blood in his veins. Thou and I will abide  together the utmost rage of our injurious oppressors, while he, free and safe,  shall arouse the awakened spirits of our countrymen to avenge us.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Not so, father Cedric,&rdquo; said Athelstane, grasping his  hand,&mdash;for, when roused to think or act, his deeds and sentiments were not  unbecoming his high race&mdash;&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;I  would rather remain in this hall a week without food save the prisoner&rsquo;s  stinted loaf, or drink save the prisoner&rsquo;s measure of water, than embrace  the opportunity to escape which the slave&rsquo;s untaught kindness has  purveyed for his master.&rdquo;          &ldquo;You are called wise men, sirs,&rdquo; said the Jester, &ldquo;and I a  crazed fool; but, uncle Cedric, and cousin Athelstane, the fool shall decide  this controversy for ye, and save ye the trouble of straining courtesies any  farther. I am like John-a-Duck&rsquo;s mare, that will let no man mount her but  John-a-Duck. I came to save my master, and if he will not  consent&mdash;basta&mdash;I can but go away home again. Kind service cannot be  chucked from hand to hand like a shuttlecock or stool-ball. I&rsquo;ll hang for  no man but my own born master.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Go, then, noble Cedric,&rdquo; said Athelstane, &ldquo;neglect not this  opportunity. Your presence without may encourage friends to our  rescue&mdash;your remaining here would ruin us all.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And is there any prospect, then, of rescue from without?&rdquo; said  Cedric, looking to the Jester.          &ldquo;Prospect, indeed!&rdquo; echoed Wamba; &ldquo;let me tell you, when you  fill my cloak, you are wrapped in a general&rsquo;s cassock. Five hundred men  are there without, and I was this morning one of the chief leaders. My  fool&rsquo;s cap was a casque, and my bauble a truncheon. Well, we shall see  what good they will make by exchanging a fool for a wise man. Truly, I fear  they will lose in valour what they may gain in discretion. And so farewell,  master, and be kind to poor Gurth and his dog Fangs; and let my cockscomb hang  in the hall at Rotherwood, in memory that I flung away my life for my master,  like a faithful&mdash;-fool.&rdquo;          The last word came out with a sort of double expression, betwixt jest and  earnest. The tears stood in Cedric&rsquo;s eyes.          &ldquo;Thy memory shall be preserved,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;while fidelity and  affection have honour upon earth! But that I trust I shall find the means of  saving Rowena, and thee, Athelstane, and thee, also, my poor Wamba, thou  shouldst not overbear me in this matter.&rdquo;          The exchange of dress was now accomplished, when a sudden doubt struck Cedric.          &ldquo;I know no language,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but my own, and a few words  of their mincing Norman. How shall I bear myself like a reverend  brother?&rdquo;          &ldquo;The spell lies in two words,&rdquo; replied  Wamba&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;Pax vobiscum&rsquo; will answer all queries. If you  go or come, eat or drink, bless or ban, &lsquo;Pax vobiscum&rsquo; carries you  through it all. It is as useful to a friar as a broomstick to a witch, or a  wand to a conjurer. Speak it but thus, in a deep grave tone,&mdash;&lsquo;Pax  vobiscum!&rsquo;&mdash;it is irresistible&mdash;Watch and ward, knight and  squire, foot and horse, it acts as a charm upon them all. I think, if they  bring me out to be hanged to-morrow, as is much to be doubted they may, I will  try its weight upon the finisher of the sentence.&rdquo;          &ldquo;If such prove the case,&rdquo; said the master, &ldquo;my religious  orders are soon taken&mdash;&lsquo;Pax vobiscum&rsquo;. I trust I shall  remember the pass-word.&mdash;Noble Athelstane, farewell; and farewell, my poor  boy, whose heart might make amends for a weaker head&mdash;I will save you, or  return and die with you. The royal blood of our Saxon kings shall not be spilt  while mine beats in my veins; nor shall one hair fall from the head of the kind  knave who risked himself for his master, if Cedric&rsquo;s peril can prevent  it.&mdash;Farewell.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Farewell, noble Cedric,&rdquo; said Athelstane; &ldquo;remember it is  the true part of a friar to accept refreshment, if you are offered any.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Farewell, uncle,&rdquo; added Wamba; &ldquo;and remember &lsquo;Pax  vobiscum&rsquo;.&rdquo;          Thus exhorted, Cedric sallied forth upon his expedition; and it was not long  ere he had occasion to try the force of that spell which his Jester had  recommended as omnipotent. In a low-arched and dusky passage, by which he  endeavoured to work his way to the hall of the castle, he was interrupted by a  female form.          &ldquo;&lsquo;Pax vobiscum!&rsquo;&rdquo; said the pseudo friar, and was  endeavouring to hurry past, when a soft voice replied, &ldquo;&lsquo;Et  vobis&mdash;quaso, domine reverendissime, pro misericordia  vestra&rsquo;.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I am somewhat deaf,&rdquo; replied Cedric, in good Saxon, and at the  same time muttered to himself, &ldquo;A curse on the fool and his &lsquo;Pax  vobiscum!&rsquo; I have lost my javelin at the first cast.&rdquo;          It was, however, no unusual thing for a priest of those days to be deaf of his  Latin ear, and this the person who now addressed Cedric knew full well.          &ldquo;I pray you of dear love, reverend father,&rdquo; she replied in his own  language, &ldquo;that you will deign to visit with your ghostly comfort a  wounded prisoner of this castle, and have such compassion upon him and us as  thy holy office teaches&mdash;Never shall good deed so highly advantage thy  convent.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Daughter,&rdquo; answered Cedric, much embarrassed, &ldquo;my time in  this castle will not permit me to exercise the duties of mine office&mdash;I  must presently forth&mdash;there is life and death upon my speed.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Yet, father, let me entreat you by the vow you have taken on you,&rdquo;  replied the suppliant, &ldquo;not to leave the oppressed and endangered without  counsel or succour.&rdquo;          &ldquo;May the fiend fly away with me, and leave me in Ifrin with the souls of  Odin and of Thor!&rdquo; answered Cedric impatiently, and would probably have  proceeded in the same tone of total departure from his spiritual character,  when the colloquy was interrupted by the harsh voice of Urfried, the old crone  of the turret.          &ldquo;How, minion,&rdquo; said she to the female speaker, &ldquo;is this the  manner in which you requite the kindness which permitted thee to leave thy  prison-cell yonder?&mdash;Puttest thou the reverend man to use ungracious  language to free himself from the importunities of a Jewess?&rdquo;          &ldquo;A Jewess!&rdquo; said Cedric, availing himself of the information to get  clear of their interruption,&mdash;&ldquo;Let me pass, woman! stop me not at  your peril. I am fresh from my holy office, and would avoid pollution.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Come this way, father,&rdquo; said the old hag, &ldquo;thou art a  stranger in this castle, and canst not leave it without a guide. Come hither,  for I would speak with thee.&mdash;And you, daughter of an accursed race, go to  the sick man&rsquo;s chamber, and tend him until my return; and woe betide you  if you again quit it without my permission!&rdquo;          Rebecca retreated. Her importunities had prevailed upon Urfried to suffer her  to quit the turret, and Urfried had employed her services where she herself  would most gladly have paid them, by the bedside of the wounded Ivanhoe. With  an understanding awake to their dangerous situation, and prompt to avail  herself of each means of safety which occurred, Rebecca had hoped something  from the presence of a man of religion, who, she learned from Urfried, had  penetrated into this godless castle. She watched the return of the supposed  ecclesiastic, with the purpose of addressing him, and interesting him in favour  of the prisoners; with what imperfect success the reader has been just  acquainted.                     CHAPTER XXVII        Fond wretch! and what canst thou relate,   But deeds of sorrow, shame, and sin?   Thy deeds are proved&mdash;thou know&rsquo;st thy fate;   But come, thy tale&mdash;begin&mdash;begin.               But I have griefs of other kind,   Troubles and sorrows more severe;   Give me to ease my tortured mind,   Lend to my woes a patient ear;   And let me, if I may not find   A friend to help&mdash;find one to hear.          C RABBE&rsquo;S  H ALL OF  J USTICE           When Urfried had with clamours and menaces driven Rebecca back to the apartment  from which she had sallied, she proceeded to conduct the unwilling Cedric into  a small apartment, the door of which she heedfully secured. Then fetching from  a cupboard a stoup of wine and two flagons, she placed them on the table, and  said in a tone rather asserting a fact than asking a question, &ldquo;Thou art  Saxon, father&mdash;Deny it not,&rdquo; she continued, observing that Cedric  hastened not to reply; &ldquo;the sounds of my native language are sweet to  mine ears, though seldom heard save from the tongues of the wretched and  degraded serfs on whom the proud Normans impose the meanest drudgery of this  dwelling. Thou art a Saxon, father&mdash;a Saxon, and, save as thou art a  servant of God, a freeman.&mdash;Thine accents are sweet in mine ear.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Do not Saxon priests visit this castle, then?&rdquo; replied Cedric;  &ldquo;it were, methinks, their duty to comfort the outcast and oppressed  children of the soil.&rdquo;          &ldquo;They come not&mdash;or if they come, they better love to revel at the  boards of their conquerors,&rdquo; answered Urfried, &ldquo;than to hear the  groans of their countrymen&mdash;so, at least, report speaks of them&mdash;of  myself I can say little. This castle, for ten years, has opened to no priest  save the debauched Norman chaplain who partook the nightly revels of  Front-de-Bœuf, and he has been long gone to render an account of his  stewardship.&mdash;But thou art a Saxon&mdash;a Saxon priest, and I have one  question to ask of thee.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I am a Saxon,&rdquo; answered Cedric, &ldquo;but unworthy, surely, of  the name of priest. Let me begone on my way&mdash;I swear I will return, or  send one of our fathers more worthy to hear your confession.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Stay yet a while,&rdquo; said Urfried; &ldquo;the accents of the voice  which thou hearest now will soon be choked with the cold earth, and I would not  descend to it like the beast I have lived. But wine must give me strength to  tell the horrors of my tale.&rdquo; She poured out a cup, and drank it with a  frightful avidity, which seemed desirous of draining the last drop in the  goblet. &ldquo;It stupifies,&rdquo; she said, looking upwards as she finished  her drought, &ldquo;but it cannot cheer&mdash;Partake it, father, if you would  hear my tale without sinking down upon the pavement.&rdquo; Cedric would have  avoided pledging her in this ominous conviviality, but the sign which she made  to him expressed impatience and despair. He complied with her request, and  answered her challenge in a large wine-cup; she then proceeded with her story,  as if appeased by his complaisance.          &ldquo;I was not born,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;father, the wretch that thou now  seest me. I was free, was happy, was honoured, loved, and was beloved. I am now  a slave, miserable and degraded&mdash;the sport of my masters&rsquo; passions  while I had yet beauty&mdash;the object of their contempt, scorn, and hatred,  since it has passed away. Dost thou wonder, father, that I should hate mankind,  and, above all, the race that has wrought this change in me? Can the wrinkled  decrepit hag before thee, whose wrath must vent itself in impotent curses,  forget she was once the daughter of the noble Thane of Torquilstone, before  whose frown a thousand vassals trembled?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou the daughter of Torquil Wolfganger!&rdquo; said Cedric, receding as  he spoke; &ldquo;thou&mdash;thou&mdash;the daughter of that noble Saxon, my  father&rsquo;s friend and companion in arms!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thy father&rsquo;s friend!&rdquo; echoed Urfried; &ldquo;then Cedric  called the Saxon stands before me, for the noble Hereward of Rotherwood had but  one son, whose name is well known among his countrymen. But if thou art Cedric  of Rotherwood, why this religious dress?&mdash;hast thou too despaired of  saving thy country, and sought refuge from oppression in the shade of the  convent?&rdquo;          &ldquo;It matters not who I am,&rdquo; said Cedric; &ldquo;proceed, unhappy  woman, with thy tale of horror and guilt!&mdash;Guilt there must be&mdash;there  is guilt even in thy living to tell it.&rdquo;          &ldquo;There is&mdash;there is,&rdquo; answered the wretched woman,  &ldquo;deep, black, damning guilt,&mdash;guilt, that lies like a load at my  breast&mdash;guilt, that all the penitential fires of hereafter cannot  cleanse.&mdash;Yes, in these halls, stained with the noble and pure blood of my  father and my brethren&mdash;in these very halls, to have lived the paramour of  their murderer, the slave at once and the partaker of his pleasures, was to  render every breath which I drew of vital air, a crime and a curse.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Wretched woman!&rdquo; exclaimed Cedric. &ldquo;And while the friends of  thy father&mdash;while each true Saxon heart, as it breathed a requiem for his  soul, and those of his valiant sons, forgot not in their prayers the murdered  Ulrica&mdash;while all mourned and honoured the dead, thou hast lived to merit  our hate and execration&mdash;lived to unite thyself with the vile tyrant who  murdered thy nearest and dearest&mdash;who shed the blood of infancy, rather  than a male of the noble house of Torquil Wolfganger should survive&mdash;with  him hast thou lived to unite thyself, and in the hands of lawless love!&rdquo;          &ldquo;In lawless hands, indeed, but not in those of love!&rdquo; answered the  hag; &ldquo;love will sooner visit the regions of eternal doom, than those  unhallowed vaults.&mdash;No, with that at least I cannot reproach  myself&mdash;hatred to Front-de-Bœuf and his race governed my soul most  deeply, even in the hour of his guilty endearments.&rdquo;          &ldquo;You hated him, and yet you lived,&rdquo; replied Cedric; &ldquo;wretch!  was there no poniard&mdash;no knife&mdash;no bodkin!&mdash;Well was it for  thee, since thou didst prize such an existence, that the secrets of a Norman  castle are like those of the grave. For had I but dreamed of the daughter of  Torquil living in foul communion with the murderer of her father, the sword of  a true Saxon had found thee out even in the arms of thy paramour!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Wouldst thou indeed have done this justice to the name of  Torquil?&rdquo; said Ulrica, for we may now lay aside her assumed name of  Urfried; &ldquo;thou art then the true Saxon report speaks thee! for even  within these accursed walls, where, as thou well sayest, guilt shrouds itself  in inscrutable mystery, even there has the name of Cedric been  sounded&mdash;and I, wretched and degraded, have rejoiced to think that there  yet breathed an avenger of our unhappy nation.&mdash;I also have had my hours  of vengeance&mdash;I have fomented the quarrels of our foes, and heated drunken  revelry into murderous broil&mdash;I have seen their blood flow&mdash;I have  heard their dying groans!&mdash;Look on me, Cedric&mdash;are there not still  left on this foul and faded face some traces of the features of Torquil?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ask me not of them, Ulrica,&rdquo; replied Cedric, in a tone of grief  mixed with abhorrence; &ldquo;these traces form such a resemblance as arises  from the graves of the dead, when a fiend has animated the lifeless  corpse.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; answered Ulrica; &ldquo;yet wore these fiendish  features the mask of a spirit of light when they were able to set at variance  the elder Front-de-Bœuf and his son Reginald! The darkness of hell should hide  what followed, but revenge must lift the veil, and darkly intimate what it  would raise the dead to speak aloud. Long had the smouldering fire of discord  glowed between the tyrant father and his savage son&mdash;long had I nursed, in  secret, the unnatural hatred&mdash;it blazed forth in an hour of drunken  wassail, and at his own board fell my oppressor by the hand of his own  son&mdash;such are the secrets these vaults conceal!&mdash;Rend asunder, ye  accursed arches,&rdquo; she added, looking up towards the roof, &ldquo;and bury  in your fall all who are conscious of the hideous mystery!&rdquo;          &ldquo;And thou, creature of guilt and misery,&rdquo; said Cedric, &ldquo;what  became thy lot on the death of thy ravisher?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Guess it, but ask it not.&mdash;Here&mdash;here I dwelt, till age,  premature age, has stamped its ghastly features on my countenance&mdash;scorned  and insulted where I was once obeyed, and compelled to bound the revenge which  had once such ample scope, to the efforts of petty malice of a discontented  menial, or the vain or unheeded curses of an impotent hag&mdash;condemned to  hear from my lonely turret the sounds of revelry in which I once partook, or  the shrieks and groans of new victims of oppression.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ulrica,&rdquo; said Cedric, &ldquo;with a heart which still, I fear,  regrets the lost reward of thy crimes, as much as the deeds by which thou didst  acquire that meed, how didst thou dare to address thee to one who wears this  robe? Consider, unhappy woman, what could the sainted Edward himself do for  thee, were he here in bodily presence? The royal Confessor was endowed by  heaven with power to cleanse the ulcers of the body, but only God himself can  cure the leprosy of the soul.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Yet, turn not from me, stern prophet of wrath,&rdquo; she exclaimed,  &ldquo;but tell me, if thou canst, in what shall terminate these new and awful  feelings that burst on my solitude&mdash;Why do deeds, long since done, rise  before me in new and irresistible horrors? What fate is prepared beyond the  grave for her, to whom God has assigned on earth a lot of such unspeakable  wretchedness? Better had I turn to Woden, Hertha, and Zernebock&mdash;to Mista,  and to Skogula, the gods of our yet unbaptized ancestors, than endure the  dreadful anticipations which have of late haunted my waking and my sleeping  hours!&rdquo;          &ldquo;I am no priest,&rdquo; said Cedric, turning with disgust from this  miserable picture of guilt, wretchedness, and despair; &ldquo;I am no priest,  though I wear a priest&rsquo;s garment.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Priest or layman,&rdquo; answered Ulrica, &ldquo;thou art the first I  have seen for twenty years, by whom God was feared or man regarded; and dost  thou bid me despair?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I bid thee repent,&rdquo; said Cedric. &ldquo;Seek to prayer and  penance, and mayest thou find acceptance! But I cannot, I will not, longer  abide with thee.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Stay yet a moment!&rdquo; said Ulrica; &ldquo;leave me not now, son of  my father&rsquo;s friend, lest the demon who has governed my life should tempt  me to avenge myself of thy hard-hearted scorn&mdash;Thinkest thou, if  Front-de-Bœuf found Cedric the Saxon in his castle, in such a disguise, that  thy life would be a long one?&mdash;Already his eye has been upon thee like a  falcon on his prey.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And be it so,&rdquo; said Cedric; &ldquo;and let him tear me with beak  and talons, ere my tongue say one word which my heart doth not warrant. I will  die a Saxon&mdash;true in word, open in deed&mdash;I bid thee  avaunt!&mdash;touch me not, stay me not!&mdash;The sight of Front-de-Bœuf  himself is less odious to me than thou, degraded and degenerate as thou  art.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; said Ulrica, no longer interrupting him; &ldquo;go thy  way, and forget, in the insolence of thy superority, that the wretch before  thee is the daughter of thy father&rsquo;s friend.&mdash;Go thy way&mdash;if I  am separated from mankind by my sufferings&mdash;separated from those whose aid  I might most justly expect&mdash;not less will I be separated from them in my  revenge!&mdash;No man shall aid me, but the ears of all men shall tingle to  hear of the deed which I shall dare to do!&mdash;Farewell!&mdash;thy scorn has  burst the last tie which seemed yet to unite me to my kind&mdash;a thought that  my woes might claim the compassion of my people.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ulrica,&rdquo; said Cedric, softened by this appeal, &ldquo;hast thou  borne up and endured to live through so much guilt and so much misery, and wilt  thou now yield to despair when thine eyes are opened to thy crimes, and when  repentance were thy fitter occupation?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Cedric,&rdquo; answered Ulrica, &ldquo;thou little knowest the human  heart. To act as I have acted, to think as I have thought, requires the  maddening love of pleasure, mingled with the keen appetite of revenge, the  proud consciousness of power; droughts too intoxicating for the human heart to  bear, and yet retain the power to prevent. Their force has long passed  away&mdash;Age has no pleasures, wrinkles have no influence, revenge itself  dies away in impotent curses. Then comes remorse, with all its vipers, mixed  with vain regrets for the past, and despair for the future!&mdash;Then, when  all other strong impulses have ceased, we become like the fiends in hell, who  may feel remorse, but never repentance.&mdash;But thy words have awakened a new  soul within me&mdash;Well hast thou said, all is possible for those who dare to  die!&mdash;Thou hast shown me the means of revenge, and be assured I will  embrace them. It has hitherto shared this wasted bosom with other and with  rival passions&mdash;henceforward it shall possess me wholly, and thou thyself  shalt say, that, whatever was the life of Ulrica, her death well became the  daughter of the noble Torquil. There is a force without beleaguering this  accursed castle&mdash;hasten to lead them to the attack, and when thou shalt  see a red flag wave from the turret on the eastern angle of the donjon, press  the Normans hard&mdash;they will then have enough to do within, and you may win  the wall in spite both of bow and mangonel.&mdash;Begone, I pray  thee&mdash;follow thine own fate, and leave me to mine.&rdquo;          Cedric would have enquired farther into the purpose which she thus darkly  announced, but the stern voice of Front-de-Bœuf was heard, exclaiming,  &ldquo;Where tarries this loitering priest? By the scallop-shell of  Compostella, I will make a martyr of him, if he loiters here to hatch treason  among my domestics!&rdquo;          &ldquo;What a true prophet,&rdquo; said Ulrica, &ldquo;is an evil conscience!  But heed him not&mdash;out and to thy people&mdash;Cry your Saxon onslaught,  and let them sing their war-song of Rollo, if they will; vengeance shall bear a  burden to it.&rdquo;          As she thus spoke, she vanished through a private door, and Reginald  Front-de-Bœuf entered the apartment. Cedric, with some difficulty, compelled  himself to make obeisance to the haughty Baron, who returned his courtesy with  a slight inclination of the head.          &ldquo;Thy penitents, father, have made a long shrift&mdash;it is the better  for them, since it is the last they shall ever make. Hast thou prepared them  for death?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I found them,&rdquo; said Cedric, in such French as he could command,  &ldquo;expecting the worst, from the moment they knew into whose power they had  fallen.&rdquo;          &ldquo;How now, Sir Friar,&rdquo; replied Front-de-Bœuf, &ldquo;thy speech,  methinks, smacks of a Saxon tongue?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I was bred in the convent of St Withold of Burton,&rdquo; answered  Cedric.          &ldquo;Ay?&rdquo; said the Baron; &ldquo;it had been better for thee to have  been a Norman, and better for my purpose too; but need has no choice of  messengers. That St Withold&rsquo;s of Burton is an owlet&rsquo;s nest worth  the harrying. The day will soon come that the frock shall protect the Saxon as  little as the mail-coat.&rdquo;          &ldquo;God&rsquo;s will be done,&rdquo; said Cedric, in a voice tremulous with  passion, which Front-de-Bœuf imputed to fear.          &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;thou dreamest already that our men-at-arms  are in thy refectory and thy ale-vaults. But do me one cast of thy holy office,  and, come what list of others, thou shalt sleep as safe in thy cell as a snail  within his shell of proof.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Speak your commands,&rdquo; said Cedric, with suppressed emotion.          &ldquo;Follow me through this passage, then, that I may dismiss thee by the  postern.&rdquo;          And as he strode on his way before the supposed friar, Front-de-Bœuf thus  schooled him in the part which he desired he should act.          &ldquo;Thou seest, Sir Friar, yon herd of Saxon swine, who have dared to  environ this castle of Torquilstone&mdash;Tell them whatever thou hast a mind  of the weakness of this fortalice, or aught else that can detain them before it  for twenty-four hours. Meantime bear thou this scroll&mdash;But  soft&mdash;canst read, Sir Priest?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Not a jot I,&rdquo; answered Cedric, &ldquo;save on my breviary; and  then I know the characters, because I have the holy service by heart, praised  be Our Lady and St Withold!&rdquo;          &ldquo;The fitter messenger for my purpose.&mdash;Carry thou this scroll to the  castle of Philip de Malvoisin; say it cometh from me, and is written by the  Templar Brian de Bois-Guilbert, and that I pray him to send it to York with all  the speed man and horse can make. Meanwhile, tell him to doubt nothing, he  shall find us whole and sound behind our battlement&mdash;Shame on it, that we  should be compelled to hide thus by a pack of runagates, who are wont to fly  even at the flash of our pennons and the tramp of our horses! I say to thee,  priest, contrive some cast of thine art to keep the knaves where they are,  until our friends bring up their lances. My vengeance is awake, and she is a  falcon that slumbers not till she has been gorged.&rdquo;          &ldquo;By my patron saint,&rdquo; said Cedric, with deeper energy than became  his character, &ldquo;and by every saint who has lived and died in England,  your commands shall be obeyed! Not a Saxon shall stir from before these walls,  if I have art and influence to detain them there.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf, &ldquo;thou changest thy tone, Sir  Priest, and speakest brief and bold, as if thy heart were in the slaughter of  the Saxon herd; and yet thou art thyself of kindred to the swine?&rdquo;          Cedric was no ready practiser of the art of dissimulation, and would at this  moment have been much the better of a hint from Wamba&rsquo;s more fertile  brain. But necessity, according to the ancient proverb, sharpens invention, and  he muttered something under his cowl concerning the men in question being  excommunicated outlaws both to church and to kingdom.          &ldquo;&lsquo;Despardieux&rsquo;,&rdquo; answered Front-de-Bœuf, &ldquo;thou  hast spoken the very truth&mdash;I forgot that the knaves can strip a fat  abbot, as well as if they had been born south of yonder salt channel. Was it  not he of St Ives whom they tied to an oak-tree, and compelled to sing a mass  while they were rifling his mails and his wallets?&mdash;No, by our  Lady&mdash;that jest was played by Gualtier of Middleton, one of our own  companions-at-arms. But they were Saxons who robbed the chapel at St Bees of  cup, candlestick and chalice, were they not?&rdquo;          &ldquo;They were godless men,&rdquo; answered Cedric.          &ldquo;Ay, and they drank out all the good wine and ale that lay in store for  many a secret carousal, when ye pretend ye are but busied with vigils and  primes!&mdash;Priest, thou art bound to revenge such sacrilege.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I am indeed bound to vengeance,&rdquo; murmured Cedric; &ldquo;Saint  Withold knows my heart.&rdquo;          Front-de-Bœuf, in the meanwhile, led the way to a postern, where, passing the  moat on a single plank, they reached a small barbican, or exterior defence,  which communicated with the open field by a well-fortified sallyport.          &ldquo;Begone, then; and if thou wilt do mine errand, and if thou return hither  when it is done, thou shalt see Saxon flesh cheap as ever was hog&rsquo;s in  the shambles of Sheffield. And, hark thee, thou seemest to be a jolly  confessor&mdash;come hither after the onslaught, and thou shalt have as much  Malvoisie as would drench thy whole convent.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Assuredly we shall meet again,&rdquo; answered Cedric.          &ldquo;Something in hand the whilst,&rdquo; continued the Norman; and, as they  parted at the postern door, he thrust into Cedric&rsquo;s reluctant hand a gold  byzant, adding, &ldquo;Remember, I will fly off both cowl and skin, if thou  failest in thy purpose.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And full leave will I give thee to do both,&rdquo; answered Cedric,  leaving the postern, and striding forth over the free field with a joyful step,  &ldquo;if, when we meet next, I deserve not better at thine  hand.&rdquo;&mdash;Turning then back towards the castle, he threw the piece of  gold towards the donor, exclaiming at the same time, &ldquo;False Norman, thy  money perish with thee!&rdquo;          Front-de-Bœuf heard the words imperfectly, but the action was  suspicious&mdash;&ldquo;Archers,&rdquo; he called to the warders on the outward  battlements, &ldquo;send me an arrow through yon monk&rsquo;s frock!&mdash;yet  stay,&rdquo; he said, as his retainers were bending their bows, &ldquo;it  avails not&mdash;we must thus far trust him since we have no better shift. I  think he dares not betray me&mdash;at the worst I can but treat with these  Saxon dogs whom I have safe in kennel.&mdash;Ho! Giles jailor, let them bring  Cedric of Rotherwood before me, and the other churl, his companion&mdash;him I  mean of Coningsburgh&mdash;Athelstane there, or what call they him? Their very  names are an encumbrance to a Norman knight&rsquo;s mouth, and have, as it  were, a flavour of bacon&mdash;Give me a stoup of wine, as jolly Prince John  said, that I may wash away the relish&mdash;place it in the armoury, and  thither lead the prisoners.&rdquo;          His commands were obeyed; and, upon entering that Gothic apartment, hung with  many spoils won by his own valour and that of his father, he found a flagon of  wine on the massive oaken table, and the two Saxon captives under the guard of  four of his dependants. Front-de-Bœuf took a long drought of wine, and then  addressed his prisoners;&mdash;for the manner in which Wamba drew the cap over  his face, the change of dress, the gloomy and broken light, and the  Baron&rsquo;s imperfect acquaintance with the features of Cedric, (who avoided  his Norman neighbours, and seldom stirred beyond his own domains,) prevented  him from discovering that the most important of his captives had made his  escape.          &ldquo;Gallants of England,&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf, &ldquo;how relish ye  your entertainment at Torquilstone?&mdash;Are ye yet aware what your  &lsquo;surquedy&rsquo; and &lsquo;outrecuidance&rsquo;   31   merit, for  scoffing at the entertainment of a prince of the House of Anjou?&mdash;Have ye  forgotten how ye requited the unmerited hospitality of the royal John? By God  and St Dennis, an ye pay not the richer ransom, I will hang ye up by the feet  from the iron bars of these windows, till the kites and hooded crows have made  skeletons of you!&mdash;Speak out, ye Saxon dogs&mdash;what bid ye for your  worthless lives?&mdash;How say you, you of Rotherwood?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Not a doit I,&rdquo; answered poor Wamba&mdash;&ldquo;and for hanging up  by the feet, my brain has been topsy-turvy, they say, ever since the biggin was  bound first round my head; so turning me upside down may peradventure restore  it again.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Saint Genevieve!&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf, &ldquo;what have we got  here?&rdquo;          And with the back of his hand he struck Cedric&rsquo;s cap from the head of the  Jester, and throwing open his collar, discovered the fatal badge of servitude,  the silver collar round his neck.          &ldquo;Giles&mdash;Clement&mdash;dogs and varlets!&rdquo; exclaimed the furious  Norman, &ldquo;what have you brought me here?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I think I can tell you,&rdquo; said De Bracy, who just entered the  apartment. &ldquo;This is Cedric&rsquo;s clown, who fought so manful a skirmish  with Isaac of York about a question of precedence.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I shall settle it for them both,&rdquo; replied Front-de-Bœuf;  &ldquo;they shall hang on the same gallows, unless his master and this boar of  Coningsburgh will pay well for their lives. Their wealth is the least they can  surrender; they must also carry off with them the swarms that are besetting the  castle, subscribe a surrender of their pretended immunities, and live under us  as serfs and vassals; too happy if, in the new world that is about to begin, we  leave them the breath of their nostrils.&mdash;Go,&rdquo; said he to two of his  attendants, &ldquo;fetch me the right Cedric hither, and I pardon your error  for once; the rather that you but mistook a fool for a Saxon franklin.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay, but,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;your chivalrous excellency will find  there are more fools than franklins among us.&rdquo;          &ldquo;What means the knave?&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf, looking towards his  followers, who, lingering and loath, faltered forth their belief, that if this  were not Cedric who was there in presence, they knew not what was become of  him.          &ldquo;Saints of Heaven!&rdquo; exclaimed De Bracy, &ldquo;he must have escaped  in the monk&rsquo;s garments!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Fiends of hell!&rdquo; echoed Front-de-Bœuf, &ldquo;it was then the  boar of Rotherwood whom I ushered to the postern, and dismissed with my own  hands!&mdash;And thou,&rdquo; he said to Wamba, &ldquo;whose folly could  overreach the wisdom of idiots yet more gross than thyself&mdash;I will give  thee holy orders&mdash;I will shave thy crown for thee!&mdash;Here, let them  tear the scalp from his head, and then pitch him headlong from the  battlements&mdash;Thy trade is to jest, canst thou jest now?&rdquo;          &ldquo;You deal with me better than your word, noble knight,&rdquo; whimpered  forth poor Wamba, whose habits of buffoonery were not to be overcome even by  the immediate prospect of death; &ldquo;if you give me the red cap you propose,  out of a simple monk you will make a cardinal.&rdquo;          &ldquo;The poor wretch,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;is resolved to die in his  vocation.&mdash;Front-de-Bœuf, you shall not slay him. Give him to me to make  sport for my Free Companions.&mdash;How sayst thou, knave? Wilt thou take heart  of grace, and go to the wars with me?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay, with my master&rsquo;s leave,&rdquo; said Wamba; &ldquo;for, look  you, I must not slip collar&rdquo; (and he touched that which he wore)  &ldquo;without his permission.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Oh, a Norman saw will soon cut a Saxon collar.&rdquo; said De Bracy.          &ldquo;Ay, noble sir,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;and thence goes the  proverb&mdash;          &lsquo;Norman saw on English oak,   On English neck a Norman yoke;   Norman spoon in English dish,   And England ruled as Normans wish;   Blithe world to England never will be more,   Till England&rsquo;s rid of all the four.&rsquo;&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou dost well, De Bracy,&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf, &ldquo;to stand  there listening to a fool&rsquo;s jargon, when destruction is gaping for us!  Seest thou not we are overreached, and that our proposed mode of communicating  with our friends without has been disconcerted by this same motley gentleman  thou art so fond to brother? What views have we to expect but instant  storm?&rdquo;          &ldquo;To the battlements then,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;when didst thou  ever see me the graver for the thoughts of battle? Call the Templar yonder, and  let him fight but half so well for his life as he has done for his  Order&mdash;Make thou to the walls thyself with thy huge body&mdash;Let me do  my poor endeavour in my own way, and I tell thee the Saxon outlaws may as well  attempt to scale the clouds, as the castle of Torquilstone; or, if you will  treat with the banditti, why not employ the mediation of this worthy franklin,  who seems in such deep contemplation of the wine-flagon?&mdash;Here,  Saxon,&rdquo; he continued, addressing Athelstane, and handing the cup to him,  &ldquo;rinse thy throat with that noble liquor, and rouse up thy soul to say  what thou wilt do for thy liberty.&rdquo;          &ldquo;What a man of mould may,&rdquo; answered Athelstane, &ldquo;providing it  be what a man of manhood ought.&mdash;Dismiss me free, with my companions, and  I will pay a ransom of a thousand marks.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And wilt moreover assure us the retreat of that scum of mankind who are  swarming around the castle, contrary to God&rsquo;s peace and the  king&rsquo;s?&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf.          &ldquo;In so far as I can,&rdquo; answered Athelstane, &ldquo;I will withdraw  them; and I fear not but that my father Cedric will do his best to assist  me.&rdquo;          &ldquo;We are agreed then,&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf&mdash;&ldquo;thou and  they are to be set at freedom, and peace is to be on both sides, for payment of  a thousand marks. It is a trifling ransom, Saxon, and thou wilt owe gratitude  to the moderation which accepts of it in exchange of your persons. But mark,  this extends not to the Jew Isaac.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nor to the Jew Isaac&rsquo;s daughter,&rdquo; said the Templar, who had  now joined them.          &ldquo;Neither,&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf, &ldquo;belong to this Saxon&rsquo;s  company.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I were unworthy to be called Christian, if they did,&rdquo; replied  Athelstane: &ldquo;deal with the unbelievers as ye list.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Neither does the ransom include the Lady Rowena,&rdquo; said De Bracy.  &ldquo;It shall never be said I was scared out of a fair prize without striking  a blow for it.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Neither,&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf, &ldquo;does our treaty refer to  this wretched Jester, whom I retain, that I may make him an example to every  knave who turns jest into earnest.&rdquo;          &ldquo;The Lady Rowena,&rdquo; answered Athelstane, with the most steady  countenance, &ldquo;is my affianced bride. I will be drawn by wild horses  before I consent to part with her. The slave Wamba has this day saved the life  of my father Cedric&mdash;I will lose mine ere a hair of his head be  injured.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thy affianced bride?&mdash;The Lady Rowena the affianced bride of a  vassal like thee?&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;Saxon, thou dreamest that the  days of thy seven kingdoms are returned again. I tell thee, the Princes of the  House of Anjou confer not their wards on men of such lineage as thine.&rdquo;          &ldquo;My lineage, proud Norman,&rdquo; replied Athelstane, &ldquo;is drawn  from a source more pure and ancient than that of a beggarly Frenchman, whose  living is won by selling the blood of the thieves whom he assembles under his  paltry standard. Kings were my ancestors, strong in war and wise in council,  who every day feasted in their hall more hundreds than thou canst number  individual followers; whose names have been sung by minstrels, and their laws  recorded by Wittenagemotes; whose bones were interred amid the prayers of  saints, and over whose tombs minsters have been builded.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou hast it, De Bracy,&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf, well pleased with  the rebuff which his companion had received; &ldquo;the Saxon hath hit thee  fairly.&rdquo;          &ldquo;As fairly as a captive can strike,&rdquo; said De Bracy, with apparent  carelessness; &ldquo;for he whose hands are tied should have his tongue at  freedom.&mdash;But thy glibness of reply, comrade,&rdquo; rejoined he, speaking  to Athelstane, &ldquo;will not win the freedom of the Lady Rowena.&rdquo;          To this Athelstane, who had already made a longer speech than was his custom to  do on any topic, however interesting, returned no answer. The conversation was  interrupted by the arrival of a menial, who announced that a monk demanded  admittance at the postern gate.          &ldquo;In the name of Saint Bennet, the prince of these bull-beggars,&rdquo;  said Front-de-Bœuf, &ldquo;have we a real monk this time, or another impostor?  Search him, slaves&mdash;for an ye suffer a second impostor to be palmed upon  you, I will have your eyes torn out, and hot coals put into the sockets.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Let me endure the extremity of your anger, my lord,&rdquo; said Giles,  &ldquo;if this be not a real shaveling. Your squire Jocelyn knows him well, and  will vouch him to be brother Ambrose, a monk in attendance upon the Prior of  Jorvaulx.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Admit him,&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf; &ldquo;most likely he brings us  news from his jovial master. Surely the devil keeps holiday, and the priests  are relieved from duty, that they are strolling thus wildly through the  country. Remove these prisoners; and, Saxon, think on what thou hast  heard.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I claim,&rdquo; said Athelstane, &ldquo;an honourable imprisonment, with  due care of my board and of my couch, as becomes my rank, and as is due to one  who is in treaty for ransom. Moreover, I hold him that deems himself the best  of you, bound to answer to me with his body for this aggression on my freedom.  This defiance hath already been sent to thee by thy sewer; thou underliest it,  and art bound to answer me&mdash;There lies my glove.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I answer not the challenge of my prisoner,&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf;  &ldquo;nor shalt thou, Maurice de Bracy.&mdash;Giles,&rdquo; he continued,  &ldquo;hang the franklin&rsquo;s glove upon the tine of yonder branched  antlers: there shall it remain until he is a free man. Should he then presume  to demand it, or to affirm he was unlawfully made my prisoner, by the belt of  Saint Christopher, he will speak to one who hath never refused to meet a foe on  foot or on horseback, alone or with his vassals at his back!&rdquo;          The Saxon prisoners were accordingly removed, just as they introduced the monk  Ambrose, who appeared to be in great perturbation.          &ldquo;This is the real &lsquo;Deus vobiscum&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Wamba, as he  passed the reverend brother; &ldquo;the others were but counterfeits.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Holy Mother,&rdquo; said the monk, as he addressed the assembled  knights, &ldquo;I am at last safe and in Christian keeping!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Safe thou art,&rdquo; replied De Bracy; &ldquo;and for Christianity,  here is the stout Baron Reginald Front-de-Bœuf, whose utter abomination is a  Jew; and the good Knight Templar, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, whose trade is to  slay Saracens&mdash;If these are not good marks of Christianity, I know no  other which they bear about them.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ye are friends and allies of our reverend father in God, Aymer, Prior of  Jorvaulx,&rdquo; said the monk, without noticing the tone of De Bracy&rsquo;s  reply; &ldquo;ye owe him aid both by knightly faith and holy charity; for what  saith the blessed Saint Augustin, in his treatise &lsquo;De Civitate  Dei&rsquo;&mdash;-&rdquo;          &ldquo;What saith the devil!&rdquo; interrupted Front-de-Bœuf; &ldquo;or  rather what dost thou say, Sir Priest? We have little time to hear texts from  the holy fathers.&rdquo;          &ldquo;&lsquo;Sancta Maria!&rsquo;&rdquo; ejaculated Father Ambrose, &ldquo;how  prompt to ire are these unhallowed laymen!&mdash;But be it known to you, brave  knights, that certain murderous caitiffs, casting behind them fear of God, and  reverence of his church, and not regarding the bull of the holy see, &lsquo;Si  quis, suadende Diabolo&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;          &ldquo;Brother priest,&rdquo; said the Templar, &ldquo;all this we know or  guess at&mdash;tell us plainly, is thy master, the Prior, made prisoner, and to  whom?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said Ambrose, &ldquo;he is in the hands of the men of  Belial, infesters of these woods, and contemners of the holy text, &lsquo;Touch  not mine anointed, and do my prophets naught of evil.&rsquo;&rdquo;          &ldquo;Here is a new argument for our swords, sirs,&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf,  turning to his companions; &ldquo;and so, instead of reaching us any  assistance, the Prior of Jorvaulx requests aid at our hands? a man is well  helped of these lazy churchmen when he hath most to do!&mdash;But speak out,  priest, and say at once, what doth thy master expect from us?&rdquo;          &ldquo;So please you,&rdquo; said Ambrose, &ldquo;violent hands having been  imposed on my reverend superior, contrary to the holy ordinance which I did  already quote, and the men of Belial having rifled his mails and budgets, and  stripped him of two hundred marks of pure refined gold, they do yet demand of  him a large sum beside, ere they will suffer him to depart from their  uncircumcised hands. Wherefore the reverend father in God prays you, as his  dear friends, to rescue him, either by paying down the ransom at which they  hold him, or by force of arms, at your best discretion.&rdquo;          &ldquo;The foul fiend quell the Prior!&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf; &ldquo;his  morning&rsquo;s drought has been a deep one. When did thy master hear of a  Norman baron unbuckling his purse to relieve a churchman, whose bags are ten  times as weighty as ours?&mdash;And how can we do aught by valour to free him,  that are cooped up here by ten times our number, and expect an assault every  moment?&rdquo;          &ldquo;And that was what I was about to tell you,&rdquo; said the monk,  &ldquo;had your hastiness allowed me time. But, God help me, I am old, and  these foul onslaughts distract an aged man&rsquo;s brain. Nevertheless, it is  of verity that they assemble a camp, and raise a bank against the walls of this  castle.&rdquo;          &ldquo;To the battlements!&rdquo; cried De Bracy, &ldquo;and let us mark what  these knaves do without;&rdquo; and so saying, he opened a latticed window  which led to a sort of bartisan or projecting balcony, and immediately called  from thence to those in the apartment&mdash;&ldquo;Saint Dennis, but the old  monk hath brought true tidings!&mdash;They bring forward mantelets and  pavisses,   32   and the archers muster on the skirts  of the wood like a dark cloud before a hailstorm.&rdquo;          Reginald Front-de-Bœuf also looked out upon the field, and immediately  snatched his bugle; and, after winding a long and loud blast, commanded his men  to their posts on the walls.          &ldquo;De Bracy, look to the eastern side, where the walls are  lowest&mdash;Noble Bois-Guilbert, thy trade hath well taught thee how to attack  and defend, look thou to the western side&mdash;I myself will take post at the  barbican. Yet, do not confine your exertions to any one spot, noble  friends!&mdash;we must this day be everywhere, and multiply ourselves, were it  possible, so as to carry by our presence succour and relief wherever the attack  is hottest. Our numbers are few, but activity and courage may supply that  defect, since we have only to do with rascal clowns.&rdquo;          &ldquo;But, noble knights,&rdquo; exclaimed Father Ambrose, amidst the bustle  and confusion occasioned by the preparations for defence, &ldquo;will none of  ye hear the message of the reverend father in God Aymer, Prior of  Jorvaulx?&mdash;I beseech thee to hear me, noble Sir Reginald!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Go patter thy petitions to heaven,&rdquo; said the fierce Norman,  &ldquo;for we on earth have no time to listen to them.&mdash;Ho! there, Anselm  I see that seething pitch and oil are ready to pour on the heads of these  audacious traitors&mdash;Look that the cross-bowmen lack not bolts.   33  &mdash;Fling abroad my banner with the  old bull&rsquo;s head&mdash;the knaves shall soon find with whom they have to  do this day!&rdquo;          &ldquo;But, noble sir,&rdquo; continued the monk, persevering in his endeavours  to draw attention, &ldquo;consider my vow of obedience, and let me discharge  myself of my Superior&rsquo;s errand.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Away with this prating dotard,&rdquo; said Front-de Bœuf, &ldquo;lock  him up in the chapel, to tell his beads till the broil be over. It will be a  new thing to the saints in Torquilstone to hear aves and paters; they have not  been so honoured, I trow, since they were cut out of stone.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Blaspheme not the holy saints, Sir Reginald,&rdquo; said De Bracy,  &ldquo;we shall have need of their aid to-day before yon rascal rout  disband.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I expect little aid from their hand,&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf,  &ldquo;unless we were to hurl them from the battlements on the heads of the  villains. There is a huge lumbering Saint Christopher yonder, sufficient to  bear a whole company to the earth.&rdquo;          The Templar had in the meantime been looking out on the proceedings of the  besiegers, with rather more attention than the brutal Front-de-Bœuf or his  giddy companion.          &ldquo;By the faith of mine order,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;these men approach  with more touch of discipline than could have been judged, however they come by  it. See ye how dexterously they avail themselves of every cover which a tree or  bush affords, and shun exposing themselves to the shot of our cross-bows? I spy  neither banner nor pennon among them, and yet will I gage my golden chain, that  they are led on by some noble knight or gentleman, skilful in the practice of  wars.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I espy him,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;I see the waving of a  knight&rsquo;s crest, and the gleam of his armour. See yon tall man in the  black mail, who is busied marshalling the farther troop of the rascaille  yeomen&mdash;by Saint Dennis, I hold him to be the same whom we called  &lsquo;Le Noir Faineant&rsquo;, who overthrew thee, Front-de-Bœuf, in the  lists at Ashby.&rdquo;          &ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; said Front-de-Bœuf, &ldquo;that he comes  here to give me my revenge. Some hilding fellow he must be, who dared not stay  to assert his claim to the tourney prize which chance had assigned him. I  should in vain have sought for him where knights and nobles seek their foes,  and right glad am I he hath here shown himself among yon villain  yeomanry.&rdquo;          The demonstrations of the enemy&rsquo;s immediate approach cut off all farther  discourse. Each knight repaired to his post, and at the head of the few  followers whom they were able to muster, and who were in numbers inadequate to  defend the whole extent of the walls, they awaited with calm determination the  threatened assault.                     CHAPTER XXVIII        This wandering race, sever&rsquo;d from other men,   Boast yet their intercourse with human arts;   The seas, the woods, the deserts, which they haunt,   Find them acquainted with their secret treasures:   And unregarded herbs, and flowers, and blossoms,   Display undreamt-of powers when gather&rsquo;d by them.          T HE  J EW           Our history must needs retrograde for the space of a few pages, to inform the  reader of certain passages material to his understanding the rest of this  important narrative. His own intelligence may indeed have easily anticipated  that, when Ivanhoe sunk down, and seemed abandoned by all the world, it was the  importunity of Rebecca which prevailed on her father to have the gallant young  warrior transported from the lists to the house which for the time the Jews  inhabited in the suburbs of Ashby.          It would not have been difficult to have persuaded Isaac to this step in any  other circumstances, for his disposition was kind and grateful. But he had also  the prejudices and scrupulous timidity of his persecuted people, and those were  to be conquered.          &ldquo;Holy Abraham!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;he is a good youth, and my  heart bleeds to see the gore trickle down his rich embroidered hacqueton, and  his corslet of goodly price&mdash;but to carry him to our house!&mdash;damsel,  hast thou well considered?&mdash;he is a Christian, and by our law we may not  deal with the stranger and Gentile, save for the advantage of our  commerce.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Speak not so, my dear father,&rdquo; replied Rebecca; &ldquo;we may not  indeed mix with them in banquet and in jollity; but in wounds and in misery,  the Gentile becometh the Jew&rsquo;s brother.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I would I knew what the Rabbi Jacob Ben Tudela would opine on it,&rdquo;  replied Isaac;&mdash;&ldquo;nevertheless, the good youth must not bleed to  death. Let Seth and Reuben bear him to Ashby.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay, let them place him in my litter,&rdquo; said Rebecca; &ldquo;I will  mount one of the palfreys.&rdquo;          &ldquo;That were to expose thee to the gaze of those dogs of Ishmael and of  Edom,&rdquo; whispered Isaac, with a suspicious glance towards the crowd of  knights and squires. But Rebecca was already busied in carrying her charitable  purpose into effect, and listed not what he said, until Isaac, seizing the  sleeve of her mantle, again exclaimed, in a hurried voice&mdash;&ldquo;Beard of  Aaron!&mdash;what if the youth perish!&mdash;if he die in our custody, shall we  not be held guilty of his blood, and be torn to pieces by the multitude?&rdquo;          &ldquo;He will not die, my father,&rdquo; said Rebecca, gently extricating  herself from the grasp of Isaac &ldquo;he will not die unless we abandon him;  and if so, we are indeed answerable for his blood to God and to man.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Isaac, releasing his hold, &ldquo;it grieveth me as  much to see the drops of his blood, as if they were so many golden byzants from  mine own purse; and I well know, that the lessons of Miriam, daughter of the  Rabbi Manasses of Byzantium whose soul is in Paradise, have made thee skilful  in the art of healing, and that thou knowest the craft of herbs, and the force  of elixirs. Therefore, do as thy mind giveth thee&mdash;thou art a good damsel,  a blessing, and a crown, and a song of rejoicing unto me and unto my house, and  unto the people of my fathers.&rdquo;          The apprehensions of Isaac, however, were not ill founded; and the generous and  grateful benevolence of his daughter exposed her, on her return to Ashby, to  the unhallowed gaze of Brian de Bois-Guilbert. The Templar twice passed and  repassed them on the road, fixing his bold and ardent look on the beautiful  Jewess; and we have already seen the consequences of the admiration which her  charms excited when accident threw her into the power of that unprincipled  voluptuary.          Rebecca lost no time in causing the patient to be transported to their  temporary dwelling, and proceeded with her own hands to examine and to bind up  his wounds. The youngest reader of romances and romantic ballads, must  recollect how often the females, during the dark ages, as they are called, were  initiated into the mysteries of surgery, and how frequently the gallant knight  submitted the wounds of his person to her cure, whose eyes had yet more deeply  penetrated his heart.          But the Jews, both male and female, possessed and practised the medical science  in all its branches, and the monarchs and powerful barons of the time  frequently committed themselves to the charge of some experienced sage among  this despised people, when wounded or in sickness. The aid of the Jewish  physicians was not the less eagerly sought after, though a general belief  prevailed among the Christians, that the Jewish Rabbins were deeply acquainted  with the occult sciences, and particularly with the cabalistical art, which had  its name and origin in the studies of the sages of Israel. Neither did the  Rabbins disown such acquaintance with supernatural arts, which added nothing  (for what could add aught?) to the hatred with which their nation was regarded,  while it diminished the contempt with which that malevolence was mingled. A  Jewish magician might be the subject of equal abhorrence with a Jewish usurer,  but he could not be equally despised. It is besides probable, considering the  wonderful cures they are said to have performed, that the Jews possessed some  secrets of the healing art peculiar to themselves, and which, with the  exclusive spirit arising out of their condition, they took great care to  conceal from the Christians amongst whom they dwelt.          The beautiful Rebecca had been heedfully brought up in all the knowledge proper  to her nation, which her apt and powerful mind had retained, arranged, and  enlarged, in the course of a progress beyond her years, her sex, and even the  age in which she lived. Her knowledge of medicine and of the healing art had  been acquired under an aged Jewess, the daughter of one of their most  celebrated doctors, who loved Rebecca as her own child, and was believed to  have communicated to her secrets, which had been left to herself by her sage  father at the same time, and under the same circumstances. The fate of Miriam  had indeed been to fall a sacrifice to the fanaticism of the times; but her  secrets had survived in her apt pupil.          Rebecca, thus endowed with knowledge as with beauty, was universally revered  and admired by her own tribe, who almost regarded her as one of those gifted  women mentioned in the sacred history. Her father himself, out of reverence for  her talents, which involuntarily mingled itself with his unbounded affection,  permitted the maiden a greater liberty than was usually indulged to those of  her sex by the habits of her people, and was, as we have just seen, frequently  guided by her opinion, even in preference to his own.          When Ivanhoe reached the habitation of Isaac, he was still in a state of  unconsciousness, owing to the profuse loss of blood which had taken place  during his exertions in the lists. Rebecca examined the wound, and having  applied to it such vulnerary remedies as her art prescribed, informed her  father that if fever could be averted, of which the great bleeding rendered her  little apprehensive, and if the healing balsam of Miriam retained its virtue,  there was nothing to fear for his guest&rsquo;s life, and that he might with  safety travel to York with them on the ensuing day. Isaac looked a little blank  at this annunciation. His charity would willingly have stopped short at Ashby,  or at most would have left the wounded Christian to be tended in the house  where he was residing at present, with an assurance to the Hebrew to whom it  belonged, that all expenses should be duly discharged. To this, however,  Rebecca opposed many reasons, of which we shall only mention two that had  peculiar weight with Isaac. The one was, that she would on no account put the  phial of precious balsam into the hands of another physician even of her own  tribe, lest that valuable mystery should be discovered; the other, that this  wounded knight, Wilfred of Ivanhoe, was an intimate favourite of Richard  Cœur-de-Lion, and that, in case the monarch should return, Isaac, who had  supplied his brother John with treasure to prosecute his rebellious purposes,  would stand in no small need of a powerful protector who enjoyed  Richard&rsquo;s favour.          &ldquo;Thou art speaking but sooth, Rebecca,&rdquo; said Isaac, giving way to  these weighty arguments&mdash;&ldquo;it were an offending of Heaven to betray  the secrets of the blessed Miriam; for the good which Heaven giveth, is not  rashly to be squandered upon others, whether it be talents of gold and shekels  of silver, or whether it be the secret mysteries of a wise  physician&mdash;assuredly they should be preserved to those to whom Providence  hath vouchsafed them. And him whom the Nazarenes of England call the  Lion&rsquo;s Heart, assuredly it were better for me to fall into the hands of a  strong lion of Idumea than into his, if he shall have got assurance of my  dealing with his brother. Wherefore I will lend ear to thy counsel, and this  youth shall journey with us unto York, and our house shall be as a home to him  until his wounds shall be healed. And if he of the Lion Heart shall return to  the land, as is now noised abroad, then shall this Wilfred of Ivanhoe be unto  me as a wall of defence, when the king&rsquo;s displeasure shall burn high  against thy father. And if he doth not return, this Wilfred may natheless repay  us our charges when he shall gain treasure by the strength of his spear and of  his sword, even as he did yesterday and this day also. For the youth is a good  youth, and keepeth the day which he appointeth, and restoreth that which he  borroweth, and succoureth the Israelite, even the child of my father&rsquo;s  house, when he is encompassed by strong thieves and sons of Belial.&rdquo;          It was not until evening was nearly closed that Ivanhoe was restored to  consciousness of his situation. He awoke from a broken slumber, under the  confused impressions which are naturally attendant on the recovery from a state  of insensibility. He was unable for some time to recall exactly to memory the  circumstances which had preceded his fall in the lists, or to make out any  connected chain of the events in which he had been engaged upon the yesterday.  A sense of wounds and injury, joined to great weakness and exhaustion, was  mingled with the recollection of blows dealt and received, of steeds rushing  upon each other, overthrowing and overthrown&mdash;of shouts and clashing of  arms, and all the heady tumult of a confused fight. An effort to draw aside the  curtain of his couch was in some degree successful, although rendered difficult  by the pain of his wound.          To his great surprise he found himself in a room magnificently furnished, but  having cushions instead of chairs to rest upon, and in other respects partaking  so much of Oriental costume, that he began to doubt whether he had not, during  his sleep, been transported back again to the land of Palestine. The impression  was increased, when, the tapestry being drawn aside, a female form, dressed in  a rich habit, which partook more of the Eastern taste than that of Europe,  glided through the door which it concealed, and was followed by a swarthy  domestic.          As the wounded knight was about to address this fair apparition, she imposed  silence by placing her slender finger upon her ruby lips, while the attendant,  approaching him, proceeded to uncover Ivanhoe&rsquo;s side, and the lovely  Jewess satisfied herself that the bandage was in its place, and the wound doing  well. She performed her task with a graceful and dignified simplicity and  modesty, which might, even in more civilized days, have served to redeem it  from whatever might seem repugnant to female delicacy. The idea of so young and  beautiful a person engaged in attendance on a sick-bed, or in dressing the  wound of one of a different sex, was melted away and lost in that of a  beneficent being contributing her effectual aid to relieve pain, and to avert  the stroke of death. Rebecca&rsquo;s few and brief directions were given in the  Hebrew language to the old domestic; and he, who had been frequently her  assistant in similar cases, obeyed them without reply.          The accents of an unknown tongue, however harsh they might have sounded when  uttered by another, had, coming from the beautiful Rebecca, the romantic and  pleasing effect which fancy ascribes to the charms pronounced by some  beneficent fairy, unintelligible, indeed, to the ear, but, from the sweetness  of utterance, and benignity of aspect, which accompanied them, touching and  affecting to the heart. Without making an attempt at further question, Ivanhoe  suffered them in silence to take the measures they thought most proper for his  recovery; and it was not until those were completed, and this kind physician  about to retire, that his curiosity could no longer be  suppressed.&mdash;&ldquo;Gentle maiden,&rdquo; he began in the Arabian tongue,  with which his Eastern travels had rendered him familiar, and which he thought  most likely to be understood by the turban&rsquo;d and caftan&rsquo;d damsel  who stood before him&mdash;&ldquo;I pray you, gentle maiden, of your  courtesy&mdash;-&rdquo;          But here he was interrupted by his fair physician, a smile which she could  scarce suppress dimpling for an instant a face, whose general expression was  that of contemplative melancholy. &ldquo;I am of England, Sir Knight, and speak  the English tongue, although my dress and my lineage belong to another  climate.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Noble damsel,&rdquo;&mdash;again the Knight of Ivanhoe began; and again  Rebecca hastened to interrupt him.          &ldquo;Bestow not on me, Sir Knight,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the epithet of  noble. It is well you should speedily know that your handmaiden is a poor  Jewess, the daughter of that Isaac of York, to whom you were so lately a good  and kind lord. It well becomes him, and those of his household, to render to  you such careful tendance as your present state necessarily demands.&rdquo;          I know not whether the fair Rowena would have been altogether satisfied with  the species of emotion with which her devoted knight had hitherto gazed on the  beautiful features, and fair form, and lustrous eyes, of the lovely Rebecca;  eyes whose brilliancy was shaded, and, as it were, mellowed, by the fringe of  her long silken eyelashes, and which a minstrel would have compared to the  evening star darting its rays through a bower of jessamine. But Ivanhoe was too  good a Catholic to retain the same class of feelings towards a Jewess. This  Rebecca had foreseen, and for this very purpose she had hastened to mention her  father&rsquo;s name and lineage; yet&mdash;for the fair and wise daughter of  Isaac was not without a touch of female weakness&mdash;she could not but sigh  internally when the glance of respectful admiration, not altogether unmixed  with tenderness, with which Ivanhoe had hitherto regarded his unknown  benefactress, was exchanged at once for a manner cold, composed, and collected,  and fraught with no deeper feeling than that which expressed a grateful sense  of courtesy received from an unexpected quarter, and from one of an inferior  race. It was not that Ivanhoe&rsquo;s former carriage expressed more than that  general devotional homage which youth always pays to beauty; yet it was  mortifying that one word should operate as a spell to remove poor Rebecca, who  could not be supposed altogether ignorant of her title to such homage, into a  degraded class, to whom it could not be honourably rendered.          But the gentleness and candour of Rebecca&rsquo;s nature imputed no fault to  Ivanhoe for sharing in the universal prejudices of his age and religion. On the  contrary the fair Jewess, though sensible her patient now regarded her as one  of a race of reprobation, with whom it was disgraceful to hold any beyond the  most necessary intercourse, ceased not to pay the same patient and devoted  attention to his safety and convalescence. She informed him of the necessity  they were under of removing to York, and of her father&rsquo;s resolution to  transport him thither, and tend him in his own house until his health should be  restored. Ivanhoe expressed great repugnance to this plan, which he grounded on  unwillingness to give farther trouble to his benefactors.          &ldquo;Was there not,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in Ashby, or near it, some Saxon  franklin, or even some wealthy peasant, who would endure the burden of a  wounded countryman&rsquo;s residence with him until he should be again able to  bear his armour?&mdash;Was there no convent of Saxon endowment, where he could  be received?&mdash;Or could he not be transported as far as Burton, where he  was sure to find hospitality with Waltheoff, the Abbot of St Withold&rsquo;s,  to whom he was related?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Any, the worst of these harbourages,&rdquo; said Rebecca, with a  melancholy smile, &ldquo;would unquestionably be more fitting for your  residence than the abode of a despised Jew; yet, Sir Knight, unless you would  dismiss your physician, you cannot change your lodging. Our nation, as you well  know, can cure wounds, though we deal not in inflicting them; and in our own  family, in particular, are secrets which have been handed down since the days  of Solomon, and of which you have already experienced the advantages. No  Nazarene&mdash;I crave your forgiveness, Sir Knight&mdash;no Christian leech,  within the four seas of Britain, could enable you to bear your corslet within a  month.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And how soon wilt THOU enable me to brook it?&rdquo; said Ivanhoe,  impatiently.          &ldquo;Within eight days, if thou wilt be patient and conformable to my  directions,&rdquo; replied Rebecca.          &ldquo;By Our Blessed Lady,&rdquo; said Wilfred, &ldquo;if it be not a sin to  name her here, it is no time for me or any true knight to be bedridden; and if  thou accomplish thy promise, maiden, I will pay thee with my casque full of  crowns, come by them as I may.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I will accomplish my promise,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;and thou shalt  bear thine armour on the eighth day from hence, if thou will grant me but one  boon in the stead of the silver thou dost promise me.&rdquo;          &ldquo;If it be within my power, and such as a true Christian knight may yield  to one of thy people,&rdquo; replied Ivanhoe, &ldquo;I will grant thy boon  blithely and thankfully.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; answered Rebecca, &ldquo;I will but pray of thee to believe  henceforward that a Jew may do good service to a Christian, without desiring  other guerdon than the blessing of the Great Father who made both Jew and  Gentile.&rdquo;          &ldquo;It were sin to doubt it, maiden,&rdquo; replied Ivanhoe; &ldquo;and I  repose myself on thy skill without further scruple or question, well trusting  you will enable me to bear my corslet on the eighth day. And now, my kind  leech, let me enquire of the news abroad. What of the noble Saxon Cedric and  his household?&mdash;what of the lovely Lady&mdash;&rdquo; He stopt, as if  unwilling to speak Rowena&rsquo;s name in the house of a Jew&mdash;&ldquo;Of  her, I mean, who was named Queen of the tournament?&rdquo;          &ldquo;And who was selected by you, Sir Knight, to hold that dignity, with  judgment which was admired as much as your valour,&rdquo; replied Rebecca.          The blood which Ivanhoe had lost did not prevent a flush from crossing his  cheek, feeling that he had incautiously betrayed a deep interest in Rowena by  the awkward attempt he had made to conceal it.          &ldquo;It was less of her I would speak,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;than of Prince  John; and I would fain know somewhat of a faithful squire, and why he now  attends me not?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Let me use my authority as a leech,&rdquo; answered Rebecca, &ldquo;and  enjoin you to keep silence, and avoid agitating reflections, whilst I apprize  you of what you desire to know. Prince John hath broken off the tournament, and  set forward in all haste towards York, with the nobles, knights, and churchmen  of his party, after collecting such sums as they could wring, by fair means or  foul, from those who are esteemed the wealthy of the land. It is said he  designs to assume his brother&rsquo;s crown.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Not without a blow struck in its defence,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe, raising  himself upon the couch, &ldquo;if there were but one true subject in England I  will fight for Richard&rsquo;s title with the best of them&mdash;ay, one or  two, in his just quarrel!&rdquo;          &ldquo;But that you may be able to do so,&rdquo; said Rebecca touching his  shoulder with her hand, &ldquo;you must now observe my directions, and remain  quiet.&rdquo;          &ldquo;True, maiden,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe, &ldquo;as quiet as these disquieted  times will permit&mdash;And of Cedric and his household?&rdquo;          &ldquo;His steward came but brief while since,&rdquo; said the Jewess,  &ldquo;panting with haste, to ask my father for certain monies, the price of  wool the growth of Cedric&rsquo;s flocks, and from him I learned that Cedric  and Athelstane of Coningsburgh had left Prince John&rsquo;s lodging in high  displeasure, and were about to set forth on their return homeward.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Went any lady with them to the banquet?&rdquo; said Wilfred.          &ldquo;The Lady Rowena,&rdquo; said Rebecca, answering the question with more  precision than it had been asked&mdash;&ldquo;The Lady Rowena went not to the  Prince&rsquo;s feast, and, as the steward reported to us, she is now on her  journey back to Rotherwood, with her guardian Cedric. And touching your  faithful squire Gurth&mdash;-&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; exclaimed the knight, &ldquo;knowest thou his name?&mdash;But  thou dost,&rdquo; he immediately added, &ldquo;and well thou mayst, for it was  from thy hand, and, as I am now convinced, from thine own generosity of spirit,  that he received but yesterday a hundred zecchins.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Speak not of that,&rdquo; said Rebecca, blushing deeply; &ldquo;I see  how easy it is for the tongue to betray what the heart would gladly  conceal.&rdquo;          &ldquo;But this sum of gold,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe, gravely, &ldquo;my honour is  concerned in repaying it to your father.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Let it be as thou wilt,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;when eight days have  passed away; but think not, and speak not now, of aught that may retard thy  recovery.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Be it so, kind maiden,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe; &ldquo;I were most  ungrateful to dispute thy commands. But one word of the fate of poor Gurth, and  I have done with questioning thee.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I grieve to tell thee, Sir Knight,&rdquo; answered the Jewess,  &ldquo;that he is in custody by the order of Cedric.&rdquo;&mdash;And then  observing the distress which her communication gave to Wilfred, she instantly  added, &ldquo;But the steward Oswald said, that if nothing occurred to renew  his master&rsquo;s displeasure against him, he was sure that Cedric would  pardon Gurth, a faithful serf, and one who stood high in favour, and who had  but committed this error out of the love which he bore to Cedric&rsquo;s son.  And he said, moreover, that he and his comrades, and especially Wamba the  Jester, were resolved to warn Gurth to make his escape by the way, in case  Cedric&rsquo;s ire against him could not be mitigated.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Would to God they may keep their purpose!&rdquo; said Ivanhoe;  &ldquo;but it seems as if I were destined to bring ruin on whomsoever hath  shown kindness to me. My king, by whom I was honoured and distinguished, thou  seest that the brother most indebted to him is raising his arms to grasp his  crown;&mdash;my regard hath brought restraint and trouble on the fairest of her  sex;&mdash;and now my father in his mood may slay this poor bondsman but for  his love and loyal service to me!&mdash;Thou seest, maiden, what an ill-fated  wretch thou dost labour to assist; be wise, and let me go, ere the misfortunes  which track my footsteps like slot-hounds, shall involve thee also in their  pursuit.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;thy weakness and thy grief, Sir Knight,  make thee miscalculate the purposes of Heaven. Thou hast been restored to thy  country when it most needed the assistance of a strong hand and a true heart,  and thou hast humbled the pride of thine enemies and those of thy king, when  their horn was most highly exalted, and for the evil which thou hast sustained,  seest thou not that Heaven has raised thee a helper and a physician, even among  the most despised of the land?&mdash;Therefore, be of good courage, and trust  that thou art preserved for some marvel which thine arm shall work before this  people. Adieu&mdash;and having taken the medicine which I shall send thee by  the hand of Reuben, compose thyself again to rest, that thou mayest be the more  able to endure the journey on the succeeding day.&rdquo;          Ivanhoe was convinced by the reasoning, and obeyed the directions, of Rebecca.  The drought which Reuben administered was of a sedative and narcotic quality,  and secured the patient sound and undisturbed slumbers. In the morning his kind  physician found him entirely free from feverish symptoms, and fit to undergo  the fatigue of a journey.          He was deposited in the horse-litter which had brought him from the lists, and  every precaution taken for his travelling with ease. In one circumstance only  even the entreaties of Rebecca were unable to secure sufficient attention to  the accommodation of the wounded knight. Isaac, like the enriched traveller of  Juvenal&rsquo;s tenth satire, had ever the fear of robbery before his eyes,  conscious that he would be alike accounted fair game by the marauding Norman  noble, and by the Saxon outlaw. He therefore journeyed at a great rate, and  made short halts, and shorter repasts, so that he passed by Cedric and  Athelstane who had several hours the start of him, but who had been delayed by  their protracted feasting at the convent of Saint Withold&rsquo;s. Yet such was  the virtue of Miriam&rsquo;s balsam, or such the strength of Ivanhoe&rsquo;s  constitution, that he did not sustain from the hurried journey that  inconvenience which his kind physician had apprehended.          In another point of view, however, the Jew&rsquo;s haste proved somewhat more  than good speed. The rapidity with which he insisted on travelling, bred  several disputes between him and the party whom he had hired to attend him as a  guard. These men were Saxons, and not free by any means from the national love  of ease and good living which the Normans stigmatized as laziness and gluttony.  Reversing Shylock&rsquo;s position, they had accepted the employment in hopes  of feeding upon the wealthy Jew, and were very much displeased when they found  themselves disappointed, by the rapidity with which he insisted on their  proceeding. They remonstrated also upon the risk of damage to their horses by  these forced marches. Finally, there arose betwixt Isaac and his satellites a  deadly feud, concerning the quantity of wine and ale to be allowed for  consumption at each meal. And thus it happened, that when the alarm of danger  approached, and that which Isaac feared was likely to come upon him, he was  deserted by the discontented mercenaries on whose protection he had relied,  without using the means necessary to secure their attachment.          In this deplorable condition the Jew, with his daughter and her wounded  patient, were found by Cedric, as has already been noticed, and soon afterwards  fell into the power of De Bracy and his confederates. Little notice was at  first taken of the horse-litter, and it might have remained behind but for the  curiosity of De Bracy, who looked into it under the impression that it might  contain the object of his enterprise, for Rowena had not unveiled herself. But  De Bracy&rsquo;s astonishment was considerable, when he discovered that the  litter contained a wounded man, who, conceiving himself to have fallen into the  power of Saxon outlaws, with whom his name might be a protection for himself  and his friends, frankly avowed himself to be Wilfred of Ivanhoe.          The ideas of chivalrous honour, which, amidst his wildness and levity, never  utterly abandoned De Bracy, prohibited him from doing the knight any injury in  his defenceless condition, and equally interdicted his betraying him to  Front-de-Bœuf, who would have had no scruples to put to death, under any  circumstances, the rival claimant of the fief of Ivanhoe. On the other hand, to  liberate a suitor preferred by the Lady Rowena, as the events of the  tournament, and indeed Wilfred&rsquo;s previous banishment from his  father&rsquo;s house, had made matter of notoriety, was a pitch far above the  flight of De Bracy&rsquo;s generosity. A middle course betwixt good and evil  was all which he found himself capable of adopting, and he commanded two of his  own squires to keep close by the litter, and to suffer no one to approach it.  If questioned, they were directed by their master to say, that the empty litter  of the Lady Rowena was employed to transport one of their comrades who had been  wounded in the scuffle. On arriving at Torquilstone, while the Knight Templar  and the lord of that castle were each intent upon their own schemes, the one on  the Jew&rsquo;s treasure, and the other on his daughter, De Bracy&rsquo;s  squires conveyed Ivanhoe, still under the name of a wounded comrade, to a  distant apartment. This explanation was accordingly returned by these men to  Front-de-Bœuf, when he questioned them why they did not make for the  battlements upon the alarm.          &ldquo;A wounded companion!&rdquo; he replied in great wrath and astonishment.  &ldquo;No wonder that churls and yeomen wax so presumptuous as even to lay  leaguer before castles, and that clowns and swineherds send defiances to  nobles, since men-at-arms have turned sick men&rsquo;s nurses, and Free  Companions are grown keepers of dying folk&rsquo;s curtains, when the castle is  about to be assailed.&mdash;To the battlements, ye loitering villains!&rdquo;  he exclaimed, raising his stentorian voice till the arches around rung again,  &ldquo;to the battlements, or I will splinter your bones with this  truncheon!&rdquo;          The men sulkily replied, &ldquo;that they desired nothing better than to go to  the battlements, providing Front-de-Bœuf would bear them out with their  master, who had commanded them to tend the dying man.&rdquo;          &ldquo;The dying man, knaves!&rdquo; rejoined the Baron; &ldquo;I promise thee  we shall all be dying men an we stand not to it the more stoutly. But I will  relieve the guard upon this caitiff companion of yours.&mdash;Here,  Urfried&mdash;hag&mdash;fiend of a Saxon witch&mdash;hearest me not?&mdash;tend  me this bedridden fellow since he must needs be tended, whilst these knaves use  their weapons.&mdash;Here be two arblasts, comrades, with windlaces and  quarrells   34  &mdash;to the barbican with you, and  see you drive each bolt through a Saxon brain.&rdquo;          The men, who, like most of their description, were fond of enterprise and  detested inaction, went joyfully to the scene of danger as they were commanded,  and thus the charge of Ivanhoe was transferred to Urfried, or Ulrica. But she,  whose brain was burning with remembrance of injuries and with hopes of  vengeance, was readily induced to devolve upon Rebecca the care of her patient.                     CHAPTER XXIX        Ascend the watch-tower yonder, valiant soldier,   Look on the field, and say how goes the battle.          S CHILLER&rsquo;S  M AID OF  O RLEANS           A moment of peril is often also a moment of open-hearted kindness and  affection. We are thrown off our guard by the general agitation of our  feelings, and betray the intensity of those, which, at more tranquil periods,  our prudence at least conceals, if it cannot altogether suppress them. In  finding herself once more by the side of Ivanhoe, Rebecca was astonished at the  keen sensation of pleasure which she experienced, even at a time when all  around them both was danger, if not despair. As she felt his pulse, and  enquired after his health, there was a softness in her touch and in her accents  implying a kinder interest than she would herself have been pleased to have  voluntarily expressed. Her voice faltered and her hand trembled, and it was  only the cold question of Ivanhoe, &ldquo;Is it you, gentle maiden?&rdquo;  which recalled her to herself, and reminded her the sensations which she felt  were not and could not be mutual. A sigh escaped, but it was scarce audible;  and the questions which she asked the knight concerning his state of health  were put in the tone of calm friendship. Ivanhoe answered her hastily that he  was, in point of health, as well, and better than he could have  expected&mdash;&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;dear Rebecca, to thy  helpful skill.&rdquo;          &ldquo;He calls me DEAR Rebecca,&rdquo; said the maiden to herself, &ldquo;but  it is in the cold and careless tone which ill suits the word. His  war-horse&mdash;his hunting hound, are dearer to him than the despised  Jewess!&rdquo;          &ldquo;My mind, gentle maiden,&rdquo; continued Ivanhoe, &ldquo;is more  disturbed by anxiety, than my body with pain. From the speeches of those men  who were my warders just now, I learn that I am a prisoner, and, if I judge  aright of the loud hoarse voice which even now dispatched them hence on some  military duty, I am in the castle of Front-de-Bœuf&mdash;If so, how will this  end, or how can I protect Rowena and my father?&rdquo;          &ldquo;He names not the Jew or Jewess,&rdquo; said Rebecca internally;  &ldquo;yet what is our portion in him, and how justly am I punished by Heaven  for letting my thoughts dwell upon him!&rdquo; She hastened after this brief  self-accusation to give Ivanhoe what information she could; but it amounted  only to this, that the Templar Bois-Guilbert, and the Baron Front-de-Bœuf,  were commanders within the castle; that it was beleaguered from without, but by  whom she knew not. She added, that there was a Christian priest within the  castle who might be possessed of more information.          &ldquo;A Christian priest!&rdquo; said the knight, joyfully; &ldquo;fetch him  hither, Rebecca, if thou canst&mdash;say a sick man desires his ghostly  counsel&mdash;say what thou wilt, but bring him&mdash;something I must do or  attempt, but how can I determine until I know how matters stand without?&rdquo;          Rebecca in compliance with the wishes of Ivanhoe, made that attempt to bring  Cedric into the wounded Knight&rsquo;s chamber, which was defeated as we have  already seen by the interference of Urfried, who had also been on the watch to  intercept the supposed monk. Rebecca retired to communicate to Ivanhoe the  result of her errand.          They had not much leisure to regret the failure of this source of intelligence,  or to contrive by what means it might be supplied; for the noise within the  castle, occasioned by the defensive preparations which had been considerable  for some time, now increased into tenfold bustle and clamour. The heavy, yet  hasty step of the men-at-arms, traversed the battlements or resounded on the  narrow and winding passages and stairs which led to the various bartisans and  points of defence. The voices of the knights were heard, animating their  followers, or directing means of defence, while their commands were often  drowned in the clashing of armour, or the clamorous shouts of those whom they  addressed. Tremendous as these sounds were, and yet more terrible from the  awful event which they presaged, there was a sublimity mixed with them, which  Rebecca&rsquo;s high-toned mind could feel even in that moment of terror. Her  eye kindled, although the blood fled from her cheeks; and there was a strong  mixture of fear, and of a thrilling sense of the sublime, as she repeated, half  whispering to herself, half speaking to her companion, the sacred  text,&mdash;&ldquo;The quiver rattleth&mdash;the glittering spear and the  shield&mdash;the noise of the captains and the shouting!&rdquo;          But Ivanhoe was like the war-horse of that sublime passage, glowing with  impatience at his inactivity, and with his ardent desire to mingle in the  affray of which these sounds were the introduction. &ldquo;If I could but drag  myself,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to yonder window, that I might see how this  brave game is like to go&mdash;If I had but bow to shoot a shaft, or battle-axe  to strike were it but a single blow for our deliverance!&mdash;It is in  vain&mdash;it is in vain&mdash;I am alike nerveless and weaponless!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Fret not thyself, noble knight,&rdquo; answered Rebecca, &ldquo;the  sounds have ceased of a sudden&mdash;it may be they join not battle.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou knowest nought of it,&rdquo; said Wilfred, impatiently; &ldquo;this  dead pause only shows that the men are at their posts on the walls, and  expecting an instant attack; what we have heard was but the instant muttering  of the storm&mdash;it will burst anon in all its fury.&mdash;Could I but reach  yonder window!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou wilt but injure thyself by the attempt, noble knight,&rdquo;  replied his attendant. Observing his extreme solicitude, she firmly added,  &ldquo;I myself will stand at the lattice, and describe to you as I can what  passes without.&rdquo;          &ldquo;You must not&mdash;you shall not!&rdquo; exclaimed Ivanhoe; &ldquo;each  lattice, each aperture, will be soon a mark for the archers; some random  shaft&mdash;&rdquo;          &ldquo;It shall be welcome!&rdquo; murmured Rebecca, as with firm pace she  ascended two or three steps, which led to the window of which they spoke.          &ldquo;Rebecca, dear Rebecca!&rdquo; exclaimed Ivanhoe, &ldquo;this is no  maiden&rsquo;s pastime&mdash;do not expose thyself to wounds and death, and  render me for ever miserable for having given the occasion; at least, cover  thyself with yonder ancient buckler, and show as little of your person at the  lattice as may be.&rdquo;          Following with wonderful promptitude the directions of Ivanhoe, and availing  herself of the protection of the large ancient shield, which she placed against  the lower part of the window, Rebecca, with tolerable security to herself,  could witness part of what was passing without the castle, and report to  Ivanhoe the preparations which the assailants were making for the storm. Indeed  the situation which she thus obtained was peculiarly favourable for this  purpose, because, being placed on an angle of the main building, Rebecca could  not only see what passed beyond the precincts of the castle, but also commanded  a view of the outwork likely to be the first object of the meditated assault.  It was an exterior fortification of no great height or strength, intended to  protect the postern-gate, through which Cedric had been recently dismissed by  Front-de-Bœuf. The castle moat divided this species of barbican from the rest  of the fortress, so that, in case of its being taken, it was easy to cut off  the communication with the main building, by withdrawing the temporary bridge.  In the outwork was a sallyport corresponding to the postern of the castle, and  the whole was surrounded by a strong palisade. Rebecca could observe, from the  number of men placed for the defence of this post, that the besieged  entertained apprehensions for its safety; and from the mustering of the  assailants in a direction nearly opposite to the outwork, it seemed no less  plain that it had been selected as a vulnerable point of attack.          These appearances she hastily communicated to Ivanhoe, and added, &ldquo;The  skirts of the wood seem lined with archers, although only a few are advanced  from its dark shadow.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Under what banner?&rdquo; asked Ivanhoe.          &ldquo;Under no ensign of war which I can observe,&rdquo; answered Rebecca.          &ldquo;A singular novelty,&rdquo; muttered the knight, &ldquo;to advance to  storm such a castle without pennon or banner displayed!&mdash;Seest thou who  they be that act as leaders?&rdquo;          &ldquo;A knight, clad in sable armour, is the most conspicuous,&rdquo; said the  Jewess; &ldquo;he alone is armed from head to heel, and seems to assume the  direction of all around him.&rdquo;          &ldquo;What device does he bear on his shield?&rdquo; replied Ivanhoe.          &ldquo;Something resembling a bar of iron, and a padlock painted blue on the  black shield.&rdquo;   35            &ldquo;A fetterlock and shacklebolt azure,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe; &ldquo;I know  not who may bear the device, but well I ween it might now be mine own. Canst  thou not see the motto?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Scarce the device itself at this distance,&rdquo; replied Rebecca;  &ldquo;but when the sun glances fair upon his shield, it shows as I tell  you.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Seem there no other leaders?&rdquo; exclaimed the anxious enquirer.          &ldquo;None of mark and distinction that I can behold from this station,&rdquo;  said Rebecca; &ldquo;but, doubtless, the other side of the castle is also  assailed. They appear even now preparing to advance&mdash;God of Zion, protect  us!&mdash;What a dreadful sight!&mdash;Those who advance first bear huge  shields and defences made of plank; the others follow, bending their bows as  they come on.&mdash;They raise their bows!&mdash;God of Moses, forgive the  creatures thou hast made!&rdquo;          Her description was here suddenly interrupted by the signal for assault, which  was given by the blast of a shrill bugle, and at once answered by a flourish of  the Norman trumpets from the battlements, which, mingled with the deep and  hollow clang of the nakers, (a species of kettle-drum,) retorted in notes of  defiance the challenge of the enemy. The shouts of both parties augmented the  fearful din, the assailants crying, &ldquo;Saint George for merry  England!&rdquo; and the Normans answering them with loud cries of &ldquo;En  avant De Bracy!&mdash;Beau-seant! Beau-seant!&mdash;Front-de-Bœuf a la  rescousse!&rdquo; according to the war-cries of their different commanders.          It was not, however, by clamour that the contest was to be decided, and the  desperate efforts of the assailants were met by an equally vigorous defence on  the part of the besieged. The archers, trained by their woodland pastimes to  the most effective use of the long-bow, shot, to use the appropriate phrase of  the time, so &ldquo;wholly together,&rdquo; that no point at which a defender  could show the least part of his person, escaped their cloth-yard shafts. By  this heavy discharge, which continued as thick and sharp as hail, while,  notwithstanding, every arrow had its individual aim, and flew by scores  together against each embrasure and opening in the parapets, as well as at  every window where a defender either occasionally had post, or might be  suspected to be stationed,&mdash;by this sustained discharge, two or three of  the garrison were slain, and several others wounded. But, confident in their  armour of proof, and in the cover which their situation afforded, the followers  of Front-de-Bœuf, and his allies, showed an obstinacy in defence proportioned  to the fury of the attack and replied with the discharge of their large  cross-bows, as well as with their long-bows, slings, and other missile weapons,  to the close and continued shower of arrows; and, as the assailants were  necessarily but indifferently protected, did considerably more damage than they  received at their hand. The whizzing of shafts and of missiles, on both sides,  was only interrupted by the shouts which arose when either side inflicted or  sustained some notable loss.          &ldquo;And I must lie here like a bedridden monk,&rdquo; exclaimed Ivanhoe,  &ldquo;while the game that gives me freedom or death is played out by the hand  of others!&mdash;Look from the window once again, kind maiden, but beware that  you are not marked by the archers beneath&mdash;Look out once more, and tell me  if they yet advance to the storm.&rdquo;          With patient courage, strengthened by the interval which she had employed in  mental devotion, Rebecca again took post at the lattice, sheltering herself,  however, so as not to be visible from beneath.          &ldquo;What dost thou see, Rebecca?&rdquo; again demanded the wounded knight.          &ldquo;Nothing but the cloud of arrows flying so thick as to dazzle mine eyes,  and to hide the bowmen who shoot them.&rdquo;          &ldquo;That cannot endure,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe; &ldquo;if they press not right  on to carry the castle by pure force of arms, the archery may avail but little  against stone walls and bulwarks. Look for the Knight of the Fetterlock, fair  Rebecca, and see how he bears himself; for as the leader is, so will his  followers be.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I see him not,&rdquo; said Rebecca.          &ldquo;Foul craven!&rdquo; exclaimed Ivanhoe; &ldquo;does he blench from the  helm when the wind blows highest?&rdquo;          &ldquo;He blenches not! he blenches not!&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;I see him  now; he leads a body of men close under the outer barrier of the barbican.   36   &mdash;They pull down the piles and  palisades; they hew down the barriers with axes.&mdash;His high black plume  floats abroad over the throng, like a raven over the field of the  slain.&mdash;They have made a breach in the barriers&mdash;they rush  in&mdash;they are thrust back!&mdash;Front-de-Bœuf heads the defenders; I see  his gigantic form above the press. They throng again to the breach, and the  pass is disputed hand to hand, and man to man. God of Jacob! it is the meeting  of two fierce tides&mdash;the conflict of two oceans moved by adverse  winds!&rdquo;          She turned her head from the lattice, as if unable longer to endure a sight so  terrible.          &ldquo;Look forth again, Rebecca,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe, mistaking the cause of  her retiring; &ldquo;the archery must in some degree have ceased, since they  are now fighting hand to hand.&mdash;Look again, there is now less  danger.&rdquo;          Rebecca again looked forth, and almost immediately exclaimed, &ldquo;Holy  prophets of the law! Front-de-Bœuf and the Black Knight fight hand to hand on  the breach, amid the roar of their followers, who watch the progress of the  strife&mdash;Heaven strike with the cause of the oppressed and of the  captive!&rdquo; She then uttered a loud shriek, and exclaimed, &ldquo;He is  down!&mdash;he is down!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Who is down?&rdquo; cried Ivanhoe; &ldquo;for our dear Lady&rsquo;s  sake, tell me which has fallen?&rdquo;          &ldquo;The Black Knight,&rdquo; answered Rebecca, faintly; then instantly again  shouted with joyful eagerness&mdash;&ldquo;But no&mdash;but no!&mdash;the name  of the Lord of Hosts be blessed!&mdash;he is on foot again, and fights as if  there were twenty men&rsquo;s strength in his single arm&mdash;His sword is  broken&mdash;he snatches an axe from a yeoman&mdash;he presses Front-de-Bœuf  with blow on blow&mdash;The giant stoops and totters like an oak under the  steel of the woodman&mdash;he falls&mdash;he falls!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Front-de-Bœuf?&rdquo; exclaimed Ivanhoe.          &ldquo;Front-de-Bœuf!&rdquo; answered the Jewess; &ldquo;his men rush to the  rescue, headed by the haughty Templar&mdash;their united force compels the  champion to pause&mdash;They drag Front-de-Bœuf within the walls.&rdquo;          &ldquo;The assailants have won the barriers, have they not?&rdquo; said  Ivanhoe.          &ldquo;They have&mdash;they have!&rdquo; exclaimed Rebecca&mdash;&ldquo;and  they press the besieged hard upon the outer wall; some plant ladders, some  swarm like bees, and endeavour to ascend upon the shoulders of each  other&mdash;down go stones, beams, and trunks of trees upon their heads, and as  fast as they bear the wounded to the rear, fresh men supply their places in the  assault&mdash;Great God! hast thou given men thine own image, that it should be  thus cruelly defaced by the hands of their brethren!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Think not of that,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe; &ldquo;this is no time for such  thoughts&mdash;Who yield?&mdash;who push their way?&rdquo;          &ldquo;The ladders are thrown down,&rdquo; replied Rebecca, shuddering;  &ldquo;the soldiers lie grovelling under them like crushed reptiles&mdash;The  besieged have the better.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Saint George strike for us!&rdquo; exclaimed the knight; &ldquo;do the  false yeomen give way?&rdquo;          &ldquo;No!&rdquo; exclaimed Rebecca, &ldquo;they bear themselves right  yeomanly&mdash;the Black Knight approaches the postern with his huge  axe&mdash;the thundering blows which he deals, you may hear them above all the  din and shouts of the battle&mdash;Stones and beams are hailed down on the bold  champion&mdash;he regards them no more than if they were thistle-down or  feathers!&rdquo;          &ldquo;By Saint John of Acre,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe, raising himself joyfully on  his couch, &ldquo;methought there was but one man in England that might do such  a deed!&rdquo;          &ldquo;The postern gate shakes,&rdquo; continued Rebecca; &ldquo;it  crashes&mdash;it is splintered by his blows&mdash;they rush in&mdash;the  outwork is won&mdash;Oh, God!&mdash;they hurl the defenders from the  battlements&mdash;they throw them into the moat&mdash;O men, if ye be indeed  men, spare them that can resist no longer!&rdquo;          &ldquo;The bridge&mdash;the bridge which communicates with the  castle&mdash;have they won that pass?&rdquo; exclaimed Ivanhoe.          &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Rebecca, &ldquo;The Templar has destroyed the plank  on which they crossed&mdash;few of the defenders escaped with him into the  castle&mdash;the shrieks and cries which you hear tell the fate of the  others&mdash;Alas!&mdash;I see it is still more difficult to look upon victory  than upon battle.&rdquo;          &ldquo;What do they now, maiden?&rdquo; said Ivanhoe; &ldquo;look forth yet  again&mdash;this is no time to faint at bloodshed.&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is over for the time,&rdquo; answered Rebecca; &ldquo;our friends  strengthen themselves within the outwork which they have mastered, and it  affords them so good a shelter from the foemen&rsquo;s shot, that the garrison  only bestow a few bolts on it from interval to interval, as if rather to  disquiet than effectually to injure them.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Our friends,&rdquo; said Wilfred, &ldquo;will surely not abandon an  enterprise so gloriously begun and so happily attained.&mdash;O no! I will put  my faith in the good knight whose axe hath rent heart-of-oak and bars of  iron.&mdash;Singular,&rdquo; he again muttered to himself, &ldquo;if there be  two who can do a deed of such derring-do!   37  &mdash;a  fetterlock, and a shacklebolt on a field sable&mdash;what may that  mean?&mdash;seest thou nought else, Rebecca, by which the Black Knight may be  distinguished?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said the Jewess; &ldquo;all about him is black as the  wing of the night raven. Nothing can I spy that can mark him further&mdash;but  having once seen him put forth his strength in battle, methinks I could know  him again among a thousand warriors. He rushes to the fray as if he were  summoned to a banquet. There is more than mere strength, there seems as if the  whole soul and spirit of the champion were given to every blow which he deals  upon his enemies. God assoilize him of the sin of bloodshed!&mdash;it is  fearful, yet magnificent, to behold how the arm and heart of one man can  triumph over hundreds.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Rebecca,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe, &ldquo;thou hast painted a hero; surely  they rest but to refresh their force, or to provide the means of crossing the  moat&mdash;Under such a leader as thou hast spoken this knight to be, there are  no craven fears, no cold-blooded delays, no yielding up a gallant emprize;  since the difficulties which render it arduous render it also glorious. I swear  by the honour of my house&mdash;I vow by the name of my bright lady-love, I  would endure ten years&rsquo; captivity to fight one day by that good  knight&rsquo;s side in such a quarrel as this!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; said Rebecca, leaving her station at the window, and  approaching the couch of the wounded knight, &ldquo;this impatient yearning  after action&mdash;this struggling with and repining at your present weakness,  will not fail to injure your returning health&mdash;How couldst thou hope to  inflict wounds on others, ere that be healed which thou thyself hast  received?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Rebecca,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;thou knowest not how impossible it is  for one trained to actions of chivalry to remain passive as a priest, or a  woman, when they are acting deeds of honour around him. The love of battle is  the food upon which we live&mdash;the dust of the &lsquo;melee&rsquo; is the  breath of our nostrils! We live not&mdash;we wish not to live&mdash;longer than  while we are victorious and renowned&mdash;Such, maiden, are the laws of  chivalry to which we are sworn, and to which we offer all that we hold  dear.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the fair Jewess, &ldquo;and what is it, valiant  knight, save an offering of sacrifice to a demon of vain glory, and a passing  through the fire to Moloch?&mdash;What remains to you as the prize of all the  blood you have spilled&mdash;of all the travail and pain you have  endured&mdash;of all the tears which your deeds have caused, when death hath  broken the strong man&rsquo;s spear, and overtaken the speed of his  war-horse?&rdquo;          &ldquo;What remains?&rdquo; cried Ivanhoe; &ldquo;Glory, maiden, glory! which  gilds our sepulchre and embalms our name.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Glory?&rdquo; continued Rebecca; &ldquo;alas, is the rusted mail which  hangs as a hatchment over the champion&rsquo;s dim and mouldering tomb&mdash;is  the defaced sculpture of the inscription which the ignorant monk can hardly  read to the enquiring pilgrim&mdash;are these sufficient rewards for the  sacrifice of every kindly affection, for a life spent miserably that ye may  make others miserable? Or is there such virtue in the rude rhymes of a  wandering bard, that domestic love, kindly affection, peace and happiness, are  so wildly bartered, to become the hero of those ballads which vagabond  minstrels sing to drunken churls over their evening ale?&rdquo;          &ldquo;By the soul of Hereward!&rdquo; replied the knight impatiently,  &ldquo;thou speakest, maiden, of thou knowest not what. Thou wouldst quench the  pure light of chivalry, which alone distinguishes the noble from the base, the  gentle knight from the churl and the savage; which rates our life far, far  beneath the pitch of our honour; raises us victorious over pain, toil, and  suffering, and teaches us to fear no evil but disgrace. Thou art no Christian,  Rebecca; and to thee are unknown those high feelings which swell the bosom of a  noble maiden when her lover hath done some deed of emprize which sanctions his  flame. Chivalry!&mdash;why, maiden, she is the nurse of pure and high  affection&mdash;the stay of the oppressed, the redresser of grievances, the  curb of the power of the tyrant&mdash;Nobility were but an empty name without  her, and liberty finds the best protection in her lance and her sword.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I am, indeed,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;sprung from a race whose  courage was distinguished in the defence of their own land, but who warred not,  even while yet a nation, save at the command of the Deity, or in defending  their country from oppression. The sound of the trumpet wakes Judah no longer,  and her despised children are now but the unresisting victims of hostile and  military oppression. Well hast thou spoken, Sir Knight,&mdash;until the God of  Jacob shall raise up for his chosen people a second Gideon, or a new Maccabeus,  it ill beseemeth the Jewish damsel to speak of battle or of war.&rdquo;          The high-minded maiden concluded the argument in a tone of sorrow, which deeply  expressed her sense of the degradation of her people, embittered perhaps by the  idea that Ivanhoe considered her as one not entitled to interfere in a case of  honour, and incapable of entertaining or expressing sentiments of honour and  generosity.          &ldquo;How little he knows this bosom,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to imagine that  cowardice or meanness of soul must needs be its guests, because I have censured  the fantastic chivalry of the Nazarenes! Would to heaven that the shedding of  mine own blood, drop by drop, could redeem the captivity of Judah! Nay, would  to God it could avail to set free my father, and this his benefactor, from the  chains of the oppressor! The proud Christian should then see whether the  daughter of God&rsquo;s chosen people dared not to die as bravely as the  vainest Nazarene maiden, that boasts her descent from some petty chieftain of  the rude and frozen north!&rdquo;          She then looked towards the couch of the wounded knight.          &ldquo;He sleeps,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;nature exhausted by sufferance and  the waste of spirits, his wearied frame embraces the first moment of temporary  relaxation to sink into slumber. Alas! is it a crime that I should look upon  him, when it may be for the last time?&mdash;When yet but a short space, and  those fair features will be no longer animated by the bold and buoyant spirit  which forsakes them not even in sleep!&mdash;When the nostril shall be  distended, the mouth agape, the eyes fixed and bloodshot; and when the proud  and noble knight may be trodden on by the lowest caitiff of this accursed  castle, yet stir not when the heel is lifted up against him!&mdash;And my  father!&mdash;oh, my father! evil is it with his daughter, when his grey hairs  are not remembered because of the golden locks of youth!&mdash;What know I but  that these evils are the messengers of Jehovah&rsquo;s wrath to the unnatural  child, who thinks of a stranger&rsquo;s captivity before a parent&rsquo;s? who  forgets the desolation of Judah, and looks upon the comeliness of a Gentile and  a stranger?&mdash;But I will tear this folly from my heart, though every fibre  bleed as I rend it away!&rdquo;          She wrapped herself closely in her veil, and sat down at a distance from the  couch of the wounded knight, with her back turned towards it, fortifying, or  endeavouring to fortify her mind, not only against the impending evils from  without, but also against those treacherous feelings which assailed her from  within.                     CHAPTER XXX        Approach the chamber, look upon his bed.   His is the passing of no peaceful ghost,   Which, as the lark arises to the sky,   &rsquo;Mid morning&rsquo;s sweetest breeze and softest dew,   Is wing&rsquo;d to heaven by good men&rsquo;s sighs and tears!&mdash;   Anselm parts otherwise.          O LD  P LAY           During the interval of quiet which followed the first success of the besiegers,  while the one party was preparing to pursue their advantage, and the other to  strengthen their means of defence, the Templar and De Bracy held brief council  together in the hall of the castle.          &ldquo;Where is Front-de-Bœuf?&rdquo; said the latter, who had superintended  the defence of the fortress on the other side; &ldquo;men say he hath been  slain.&rdquo;          &ldquo;He lives,&rdquo; said the Templar, coolly, &ldquo;lives as yet; but had  he worn the bull&rsquo;s head of which he bears the name, and ten plates of  iron to fence it withal, he must have gone down before yonder fatal axe. Yet a  few hours, and Front-de-Bœuf is with his fathers&mdash;a powerful limb lopped  off Prince John&rsquo;s enterprise.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And a brave addition to the kingdom of Satan,&rdquo; said De Bracy;  &ldquo;this comes of reviling saints and angels, and ordering images of holy  things and holy men to be flung down on the heads of these rascaille  yeomen.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Go to&mdash;thou art a fool,&rdquo; said the Templar; &ldquo;thy  superstition is upon a level with Front-de-Bœuf&rsquo;s want of faith; neither  of you can render a reason for your belief or unbelief.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Benedicite, Sir Templar,&rdquo; replied De Bracy, &ldquo;pray you to  keep better rule with your tongue when I am the theme of it. By the Mother of  Heaven, I am a better Christian man than thou and thy fellowship; for the  &lsquo;bruit&rsquo; goeth shrewdly out, that the most holy Order of the Temple  of Zion nurseth not a few heretics within its bosom, and that Sir Brian de  Bois-Guilbert is of the number.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Care not thou for such reports,&rdquo; said the Templar; &ldquo;but let  us think of making good the castle.&mdash;How fought these villain yeomen on  thy side?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Like fiends incarnate,&rdquo; said De Bracy. &ldquo;They swarmed close  up to the walls, headed, as I think, by the knave who won the prize at the  archery, for I knew his horn and baldric. And this is old Fitzurse&rsquo;s  boasted policy, encouraging these malapert knaves to rebel against us! Had I  not been armed in proof, the villain had marked me down seven times with as  little remorse as if I had been a buck in season. He told every rivet on my  armour with a cloth-yard shaft, that rapped against my ribs with as little  compunction as if my bones had been of iron&mdash;But that I wore a shirt of  Spanish mail under my plate-coat, I had been fairly sped.&rdquo;          &ldquo;But you maintained your post?&rdquo; said the Templar. &ldquo;We lost  the outwork on our part.&rdquo;          &ldquo;That is a shrewd loss,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;the knaves will find  cover there to assault the castle more closely, and may, if not well watched,  gain some unguarded corner of a tower, or some forgotten window, and so break  in upon us. Our numbers are too few for the defence of every point, and the men  complain that they can nowhere show themselves, but they are the mark for as  many arrows as a parish-butt on a holyday even. Front-de-Bœuf is dying too, so  we shall receive no more aid from his bull&rsquo;s head and brutal strength.  How think you, Sir Brian, were we not better make a virtue of necessity, and  compound with the rogues by delivering up our prisoners?&rdquo;          &ldquo;How?&rdquo; exclaimed the Templar; &ldquo;deliver up our prisoners, and  stand an object alike of ridicule and execration, as the doughty warriors who  dared by a night-attack to possess themselves of the persons of a party of  defenceless travellers, yet could not make good a strong castle against a  vagabond troop of outlaws, led by swineherds, jesters, and the very refuse of  mankind?&mdash;Shame on thy counsel, Maurice de Bracy!&mdash;The ruins of this  castle shall bury both my body and my shame, ere I consent to such base and  dishonourable composition.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Let us to the walls, then,&rdquo; said De Bracy, carelessly; &ldquo;that  man never breathed, be he Turk or Templar, who held life at lighter rate than I  do. But I trust there is no dishonour in wishing I had here some two scores of  my gallant troop of Free Companions?&mdash;Oh, my brave lances! if ye knew but  how hard your captain were this day bested, how soon should I see my banner at  the head of your clump of spears! And how short while would these rabble  villains stand to endure your encounter!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Wish for whom thou wilt,&rdquo; said the Templar, &ldquo;but let us make  what defence we can with the soldiers who remain&mdash;They are chiefly  Front-de-Bœuf&rsquo;s followers, hated by the English for a thousand acts of  insolence and oppression.&rdquo;          &ldquo;The better,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;the rugged slaves will defend  themselves to the last drop of their blood, ere they encounter the revenge of  the peasants without. Let us up and be doing, then, Brian de Bois-Guilbert;  and, live or die, thou shalt see Maurice de Bracy bear himself this day as a  gentleman of blood and lineage.&rdquo;          &ldquo;To the walls!&rdquo; answered the Templar; and they both ascended the  battlements to do all that skill could dictate, and manhood accomplish, in  defence of the place. They readily agreed that the point of greatest danger was  that opposite to the outwork of which the assailants had possessed themselves.  The castle, indeed, was divided from that barbican by the moat, and it was  impossible that the besiegers could assail the postern-door, with which the  outwork corresponded, without surmounting that obstacle; but it was the opinion  both of the Templar and De Bracy, that the besiegers, if governed by the same  policy their leader had already displayed, would endeavour, by a formidable  assault, to draw the chief part of the defenders&rsquo; observation to this  point, and take measures to avail themselves of every negligence which might  take place in the defence elsewhere. To guard against such an evil, their  numbers only permitted the knights to place sentinels from space to space along  the walls in communication with each other, who might give the alarm whenever  danger was threatened. Meanwhile, they agreed that De Bracy should command the  defence at the postern, and the Templar should keep with him a score of men or  thereabouts as a body of reserve, ready to hasten to any other point which  might be suddenly threatened. The loss of the barbican had also this  unfortunate effect, that, notwithstanding the superior height of the castle  walls, the besieged could not see from them, with the same precision as before,  the operations of the enemy; for some straggling underwood approached so near  the sallyport of the outwork, that the assailants might introduce into it  whatever force they thought proper, not only under cover, but even without the  knowledge of the defenders. Utterly uncertain, therefore, upon what point the  storm was to burst, De Bracy and his companion were under the necessity of  providing against every possible contingency, and their followers, however  brave, experienced the anxious dejection of mind incident to men enclosed by  enemies, who possessed the power of choosing their time and mode of attack.          Meanwhile, the lord of the beleaguered and endangered castle lay upon a bed of  bodily pain and mental agony. He had not the usual resource of bigots in that  superstitious period, most of whom were wont to atone for the crimes they were  guilty of by liberality to the church, stupefying by this means their terrors  by the idea of atonement and forgiveness; and although the refuge which success  thus purchased, was no more like to the peace of mind which follows on sincere  repentance, than the turbid stupefaction procured by opium resembles healthy  and natural slumbers, it was still a state of mind preferable to the agonies of  awakened remorse. But among the vices of Front-de-Bœuf, a hard and griping  man, avarice was predominant; and he preferred setting church and churchmen at  defiance, to purchasing from them pardon and absolution at the price of  treasure and of manors. Nor did the Templar, an infidel of another stamp,  justly characterise his associate, when he said Front-de-Bœuf could assign no  cause for his unbelief and contempt for the established faith; for the Baron  would have alleged that the Church sold her wares too dear, that the spiritual  freedom which she put up to sale was only to be bought like that of the chief  captain of Jerusalem, &ldquo;with a great sum,&rdquo; and Front-de-Bœuf  preferred denying the virtue of the medicine, to paying the expense of the  physician.          But the moment had now arrived when earth and all his treasures were gliding  from before his eyes, and when the savage Baron&rsquo;s heart, though hard as a  nether millstone, became appalled as he gazed forward into the waste darkness  of futurity. The fever of his body aided the impatience and agony of his mind,  and his death-bed exhibited a mixture of the newly awakened feelings of horror,  combating with the fixed and inveterate obstinacy of his disposition;&mdash;a  fearful state of mind, only to be equalled in those tremendous regions, where  there are complaints without hope, remorse without repentance, a dreadful sense  of present agony, and a presentiment that it cannot cease or be diminished!          &ldquo;Where be these dog-priests now,&rdquo; growled the Baron, &ldquo;who set  such price on their ghostly mummery?&mdash;where be all those unshod  Carmelites, for whom old Front-de-Bœuf founded the convent of St Anne, robbing  his heir of many a fair rood of meadow, and many a fat field and  close&mdash;where be the greedy hounds now?&mdash;Swilling, I warrant me, at  the ale, or playing their juggling tricks at the bedside of some miserly  churl.&mdash;Me, the heir of their founder&mdash;me, whom their foundation  binds them to pray for&mdash;me&mdash;ungrateful villains as they  are!&mdash;they suffer to die like the houseless dog on yonder common,  unshriven and unhouseled!&mdash;Tell the Templar to come hither&mdash;he is a  priest, and may do something&mdash;But no!&mdash;as well confess myself to the  devil as to Brian de Bois-Guilbert, who recks neither of heaven nor of  hell.&mdash;I have heard old men talk of prayer&mdash;prayer by their own  voice&mdash;Such need not to court or to bribe the false priest&mdash;But  I&mdash;I dare not!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Lives Reginald Front-de-Bœuf,&rdquo; said a broken and shrill voice  close by his bedside, &ldquo;to say there is that which he dares not!&rdquo;          The evil conscience and the shaken nerves of Front-de-Bœuf heard, in this  strange interruption to his soliloquy, the voice of one of those demons, who,  as the superstition of the times believed, beset the beds of dying men to  distract their thoughts, and turn them from the meditations which concerned  their eternal welfare. He shuddered and drew himself together; but, instantly  summoning up his wonted resolution, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Who is  there?&mdash;what art thou, that darest to echo my words in a tone like that of  the night-raven?&mdash;Come before my couch that I may see thee.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I am thine evil angel, Reginald Front-de-Bœuf,&rdquo; replied the  voice.          &ldquo;Let me behold thee then in thy bodily shape, if thou be&rsquo;st indeed  a fiend,&rdquo; replied the dying knight; &ldquo;think not that I will blench  from thee.&mdash;By the eternal dungeon, could I but grapple with these horrors  that hover round me, as I have done with mortal dangers, heaven or hell should  never say that I shrunk from the conflict!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Think on thy sins, Reginald Front-de-Bœuf,&rdquo; said the almost  unearthly voice, &ldquo;on rebellion, on rapine, on murder!&mdash;Who stirred  up the licentious John to war against his grey-headed father&mdash;against his  generous brother?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Be thou fiend, priest, or devil,&rdquo; replied Front-de-Bœuf,  &ldquo;thou liest in thy throat!&mdash;Not I stirred John to  rebellion&mdash;not I alone&mdash;there were fifty knights and barons, the  flower of the midland counties&mdash;better men never laid lance in  rest&mdash;And must I answer for the fault done by fifty?&mdash;False fiend, I  defy thee! Depart, and haunt my couch no more&mdash;let me die in peace if thou  be mortal&mdash;if thou be a demon, thy time is not yet come.&rdquo;          &ldquo;In peace thou shalt NOT die,&rdquo; repeated the voice; &ldquo;even in  death shalt thou think on thy murders&mdash;on the groans which this castle has  echoed&mdash;on the blood that is engrained in its floors!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou canst not shake me by thy petty malice,&rdquo; answered  Front-de-Bœuf, with a ghastly and constrained laugh. &ldquo;The infidel  Jew&mdash;it was merit with heaven to deal with him as I did, else wherefore  are men canonized who dip their hands in the blood of Saracens?&mdash;The Saxon  porkers, whom I have slain, they were the foes of my country, and of my  lineage, and of my liege lord.&mdash;Ho! ho! thou seest there is no crevice in  my coat of plate&mdash;Art thou fled?&mdash;art thou silenced?&rdquo;          &ldquo;No, foul parricide!&rdquo; replied the voice; &ldquo;think of thy  father!&mdash;think of his death!&mdash;think of his banquet-room flooded with  his gore, and that poured forth by the hand of a son!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; answered the Baron, after a long pause, &ldquo;an thou  knowest that, thou art indeed the author of evil, and as omniscient as the  monks call thee!&mdash;That secret I deemed locked in my own breast, and in  that of one besides&mdash;the temptress, the partaker of my guilt.&mdash;Go,  leave me, fiend! and seek the Saxon witch Ulrica, who alone could tell thee  what she and I alone witnessed.&mdash;Go, I say, to her, who washed the wounds,  and straighted the corpse, and gave to the slain man the outward show of one  parted in time and in the course of nature&mdash;Go to her, she was my  temptress, the foul provoker, the more foul rewarder, of the deed&mdash;let  her, as well as I, taste of the tortures which anticipate hell!&rdquo;          &ldquo;She already tastes them,&rdquo; said Ulrica, stepping before the couch  of Front-de-Bœuf; &ldquo;she hath long drunken of this cup, and its bitterness  is now sweetened to see that thou dost partake it.&mdash;Grind not thy teeth,  Front-de-Bœuf&mdash;roll not thine eyes&mdash;clench not thine hand, nor shake  it at me with that gesture of menace!&mdash;The hand which, like that of thy  renowned ancestor who gained thy name, could have broken with one stroke the  skull of a mountain-bull, is now unnerved and powerless as mine own!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Vile murderous hag!&rdquo; replied Front-de-Bœuf; &ldquo;detestable  screech-owl! it is then thou who art come to exult over the ruins thou hast  assisted to lay low?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay, Reginald Front-de-Bœuf,&rdquo; answered she, &ldquo;it is  Ulrica!&mdash;it is the daughter of the murdered Torquil Wolfganger!&mdash;it  is the sister of his slaughtered sons!&mdash;it is she who demands of thee, and  of thy father&rsquo;s house, father and kindred, name and fame&mdash;all that  she has lost by the name of Front-de-Bœuf!&mdash;Think of my wrongs,  Front-de-Bœuf, and answer me if I speak not truth. Thou hast been my evil  angel, and I will be thine&mdash;I will dog thee till the very instant of  dissolution!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Detestable fury!&rdquo; exclaimed Front-de-Bœuf, &ldquo;that moment  shalt thou never witness&mdash;Ho! Giles, Clement, and Eustace! Saint Maur, and  Stephen! seize this damned witch, and hurl her from the battlements  headlong&mdash;she has betrayed us to the Saxon!&mdash;Ho! Saint Maur! Clement!  false-hearted, knaves, where tarry ye?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Call on them again, valiant Baron,&rdquo; said the hag, with a smile of  grisly mockery; &ldquo;summon thy vassals around thee, doom them that loiter to  the scourge and the dungeon&mdash;But know, mighty chief,&rdquo; she continued,  suddenly changing her tone, &ldquo;thou shalt have neither answer, nor aid, nor  obedience at their hands.&mdash;Listen to these horrid sounds,&rdquo; for the  din of the recommenced assault and defence now rung fearfully loud from the  battlements of the castle; &ldquo;in that war-cry is the downfall of thy  house&mdash;The blood-cemented fabric of Front-de-Bœuf&rsquo;s power totters  to the foundation, and before the foes he most despised!&mdash;The Saxon,  Reginald!&mdash;the scorned Saxon assails thy walls!&mdash;Why liest thou here,  like a worn-out hind, when the Saxon storms thy place of strength?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Gods and fiends!&rdquo; exclaimed the wounded knight; &ldquo;O, for one  moment&rsquo;s strength, to drag myself to the &lsquo;melee&rsquo;, and perish  as becomes my name!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Think not of it, valiant warrior!&rdquo; replied she; &ldquo;thou shalt  die no soldier&rsquo;s death, but perish like the fox in his den, when the  peasants have set fire to the cover around it.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Hateful hag! thou liest!&rdquo; exclaimed Front-de-Bœuf; &ldquo;my  followers bear them bravely&mdash;my walls are strong and high&mdash;my  comrades in arms fear not a whole host of Saxons, were they headed by Hengist  and Horsa!&mdash;The war-cry of the Templar and of the Free Companions rises  high over the conflict! And by mine honour, when we kindle the blazing beacon,  for joy of our defence, it shall consume thee, body and bones; and I shall live  to hear thou art gone from earthly fires to those of that hell, which never  sent forth an incarnate fiend more utterly diabolical!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Hold thy belief,&rdquo; replied Ulrica, &ldquo;till the proof reach  thee&mdash;But, no!&rdquo; she said, interrupting herself, &ldquo;thou shalt  know, even now, the doom, which all thy power, strength, and courage, is unable  to avoid, though it is prepared for thee by this feeble band. Markest thou the  smouldering and suffocating vapour which already eddies in sable folds through  the chamber?&mdash;Didst thou think it was but the darkening of thy bursting  eyes&mdash;the difficulty of thy cumbered breathing?&mdash;No! Front-de-Bœuf,  there is another cause&mdash;Rememberest thou the magazine of fuel that is  stored beneath these apartments?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Woman!&rdquo; he exclaimed with fury, &ldquo;thou hast not set fire to  it?&mdash;By heaven, thou hast, and the castle is in flames!&rdquo;          &ldquo;They are fast rising at least,&rdquo; said Ulrica, with frightful  composure; &ldquo;and a signal shall soon wave to warn the besiegers to press  hard upon those who would extinguish them.&mdash;Farewell,  Front-de-Bœuf!&mdash;May Mista, Skogula, and Zernebock, gods of the ancient  Saxons&mdash;fiends, as the priests now call them&mdash;supply the place of  comforters at your dying bed, which Ulrica now relinquishes!&mdash;But know, if  it will give thee comfort to know it, that Ulrica is bound to the same dark  coast with thyself, the companion of thy punishment as the companion of thy  guilt.&mdash;And now, parricide, farewell for ever!&mdash;May each stone of  this vaulted roof find a tongue to echo that title into thine ear!&rdquo;          So saying, she left the apartment; and Front-de-Bœuf could hear the crash of  the ponderous key, as she locked and double-locked the door behind her, thus  cutting off the most slender chance of escape. In the extremity of agony he  shouted upon his servants and allies&mdash;&ldquo;Stephen and Saint  Maur!&mdash;Clement and Giles!&mdash;I burn here unaided!&mdash;To the  rescue&mdash;to the rescue, brave Bois-Guilbert, valiant De Bracy!&mdash;It is  Front-de-Bœuf who calls!&mdash;It is your master, ye traitor  squires!&mdash;Your ally&mdash;your brother in arms, ye perjured and faithless  knights!&mdash;all the curses due to traitors upon your recreant heads, do you  abandon me to perish thus miserably!&mdash;They hear me not&mdash;they cannot  hear me&mdash;my voice is lost in the din of battle.&mdash;The smoke rolls  thicker and thicker&mdash;the fire has caught upon the floor below&mdash;O, for  one drought of the air of heaven, were it to be purchased by instant  annihilation!&rdquo; And in the mad frenzy of despair, the wretch now shouted  with the shouts of the fighters, now muttered curses on himself, on mankind,  and on Heaven itself.&mdash;&ldquo;The red fire flashes through the thick  smoke!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;the demon marches against me under the  banner of his own element&mdash;Foul spirit, avoid!&mdash;I go not with thee  without my comrades&mdash;all, all are thine, that garrison these  walls&mdash;Thinkest thou Front-de-Bœuf will be singled out to go  alone?&mdash;No&mdash;the infidel Templar&mdash;the licentious De  Bracy&mdash;Ulrica, the foul murdering strumpet&mdash;the men who aided my  enterprises&mdash;the dog Saxons and accursed Jews, who are my  prisoners&mdash;all, all shall attend me&mdash;a goodly fellowship as ever took  the downward road&mdash;Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo; and he laughed in his frenzy till  the vaulted roof rang again. &ldquo;Who laughed there?&rdquo; exclaimed  Front-de-Bœuf, in altered mood, for the noise of the conflict did not prevent  the echoes of his own mad laughter from returning upon his ear&mdash;&ldquo;who  laughed there?&mdash;Ulrica, was it thou?&mdash;Speak, witch, and I forgive  thee&mdash;for, only thou or the fiend of hell himself could have laughed at  such a moment. Avaunt&mdash;avaunt!&mdash;-&rdquo;          But it were impious to trace any farther the picture of the blasphemer and  parricide&rsquo;s deathbed.                     CHAPTER XXXI        Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more,   Or, close the wall up with our English dead.   &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;And you, good yeomen,   Whose limbs were made in England, show us here   The mettle of your pasture&mdash;let us swear   That you are worth your breeding.          K ING  H ENRY  V          Cedric, although not greatly confident in Ulrica&rsquo;s message, omitted not  to communicate her promise to the Black Knight and Locksley. They were well  pleased to find they had a friend within the place, who might, in the moment of  need, be able to facilitate their entrance, and readily agreed with the Saxon  that a storm, under whatever disadvantages, ought to be attempted, as the only  means of liberating the prisoners now in the hands of the cruel Front-de-Bœuf.          &ldquo;The royal blood of Alfred is endangered,&rdquo; said Cedric.          &ldquo;The honour of a noble lady is in peril,&rdquo; said the Black Knight.          &ldquo;And, by the Saint Christopher at my baldric,&rdquo; said the good  yeoman, &ldquo;were there no other cause than the safety of that poor faithful  knave, Wamba, I would jeopard a joint ere a hair of his head were hurt.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And so would I,&rdquo; said the Friar; &ldquo;what, sirs! I trust well  that a fool&mdash;I mean, d&rsquo;ye see me, sirs, a fool that is free of his  guild and master of his craft, and can give as much relish and flavour to a cup  of wine as ever a flitch of bacon can&mdash;I say, brethren, such a fool shall  never want a wise clerk to pray for or fight for him at a strait, while I can  say a mass or flourish a partisan.&rdquo; And with that he made his heavy  halberd to play around his head as a shepherd boy flourishes his light crook.          &ldquo;True, Holy Clerk,&rdquo; said the Black Knight, &ldquo;true as if Saint  Dunstan himself had said it.&mdash;And now, good Locksley, were it not well  that noble Cedric should assume the direction of this assault?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Not a jot I,&rdquo; returned Cedric; &ldquo;I have never been wont to  study either how to take or how to hold out those abodes of tyrannic power,  which the Normans have erected in this groaning land. I will fight among the  foremost; but my honest neighbours well know I am not a trained soldier in the  discipline of wars, or the attack of strongholds.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Since it stands thus with noble Cedric,&rdquo; said Locksley, &ldquo;I  am most willing to take on me the direction of the archery; and ye shall hang  me up on my own Trysting-tree, an the defenders be permitted to show themselves  over the walls without being stuck with as many shafts as there are cloves in a  gammon of bacon at Christmas.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Well said, stout yeoman,&rdquo; answered the Black Knight; &ldquo;and if  I be thought worthy to have a charge in these matters, and can find among these  brave men as many as are willing to follow a true English knight, for so I may  surely call myself, I am ready, with such skill as my experience has taught me,  to lead them to the attack of these walls.&rdquo;          The parts being thus distributed to the leaders, they commenced the first  assault, of which the reader has already heard the issue.          When the barbican was carried, the Sable Knight sent notice of the happy event  to Locksley, requesting him at the same time, to keep such a strict observation  on the castle as might prevent the defenders from combining their force for a  sudden sally, and recovering the outwork which they had lost. This the knight  was chiefly desirous of avoiding, conscious that the men whom he led, being  hasty and untrained volunteers, imperfectly armed and unaccustomed to  discipline, must, upon any sudden attack, fight at great disadvantage with the  veteran soldiers of the Norman knights, who were well provided with arms both  defensive and offensive; and who, to match the zeal and high spirit of the  besiegers, had all the confidence which arises from perfect discipline and the  habitual use of weapons.          The knight employed the interval in causing to be constructed a sort of  floating bridge, or long raft, by means of which he hoped to cross the moat in  despite of the resistance of the enemy. This was a work of some time, which the  leaders the less regretted, as it gave Ulrica leisure to execute her plan of  diversion in their favour, whatever that might be.          When the raft was completed, the Black Knight addressed the  besiegers:&mdash;&ldquo;It avails not waiting here longer, my friends; the sun  is descending to the west&mdash;and I have that upon my hands which will not  permit me to tarry with you another day. Besides, it will be a marvel if the  horsemen come not upon us from York, unless we speedily accomplish our purpose.  Wherefore, one of ye go to Locksley, and bid him commence a discharge of arrows  on the opposite side of the castle, and move forward as if about to assault it;  and you, true English hearts, stand by me, and be ready to thrust the raft  endlong over the moat whenever the postern on our side is thrown open. Follow  me boldly across, and aid me to burst yon sallyport in the main wall of the  castle. As many of you as like not this service, or are but ill armed to meet  it, do you man the top of the outwork, draw your bow-strings to your ears, and  mind you quell with your shot whatever shall appear to man the  rampart&mdash;Noble Cedric, wilt thou take the direction of those which  remain?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Not so, by the soul of Hereward!&rdquo; said the Saxon; &ldquo;lead I  cannot; but may posterity curse me in my grave, if I follow not with the  foremost wherever thou shalt point the way&mdash;The quarrel is mine, and well  it becomes me to be in the van of the battle.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Yet, bethink thee, noble Saxon,&rdquo; said the knight, &ldquo;thou hast  neither hauberk, nor corslet, nor aught but that light helmet, target, and  sword.&rdquo;          &ldquo;The better!&rdquo; answered Cedric; &ldquo;I shall be the lighter to  climb these walls. And,&mdash;forgive the boast, Sir Knight,&mdash;thou shalt  this day see the naked breast of a Saxon as boldly presented to the battle as  ever ye beheld the steel corslet of a Norman.&rdquo;          &ldquo;In the name of God, then,&rdquo; said the knight, &ldquo;fling open the  door, and launch the floating bridge.&rdquo;          The portal, which led from the inner-wall of the barbican to the moat, and  which corresponded with a sallyport in the main wall of the castle, was now  suddenly opened; the temporary bridge was then thrust forward, and soon flashed  in the waters, extending its length between the castle and outwork, and forming  a slippery and precarious passage for two men abreast to cross the moat. Well  aware of the importance of taking the foe by surprise, the Black Knight,  closely followed by Cedric, threw himself upon the bridge, and reached the  opposite side. Here he began to thunder with his axe upon the gate of the  castle, protected in part from the shot and stones cast by the defenders by the  ruins of the former drawbridge, which the Templar had demolished in his retreat  from the barbican, leaving the counterpoise still attached to the upper part of  the portal. The followers of the knight had no such shelter; two were instantly  shot with cross-bow bolts, and two more fell into the moat; the others  retreated back into the barbican.          The situation of Cedric and of the Black Knight was now truly dangerous, and  would have been still more so, but for the constancy of the archers in the  barbican, who ceased not to shower their arrows upon the battlements,  distracting the attention of those by whom they were manned, and thus affording  a respite to their two chiefs from the storm of missiles which must otherwise  have overwhelmed them. But their situation was eminently perilous, and was  becoming more so with every moment.          &ldquo;Shame on ye all!&rdquo; cried De Bracy to the soldiers around him;  &ldquo;do ye call yourselves cross-bowmen, and let these two dogs keep their  station under the walls of the castle?&mdash;Heave over the coping stones from  the battlements, an better may not be&mdash;Get pick-axe and levers, and down  with that huge pinnacle!&rdquo; pointing to a heavy piece of stone carved-work  that projected from the parapet.          At this moment the besiegers caught sight of the red flag upon the angle of the  tower which Ulrica had described to Cedric. The stout yeoman Locksley was the  first who was aware of it, as he was hasting to the outwork, impatient to see  the progress of the assault.          &ldquo;Saint George!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;Merry Saint George for  England!&mdash;To the charge, bold yeomen!&mdash;why leave ye the good knight  and noble Cedric to storm the pass alone?&mdash;make in, mad priest, show thou  canst fight for thy rosary,&mdash;make in, brave yeomen!&mdash;the castle is  ours, we have friends within&mdash;See yonder flag, it is the appointed  signal&mdash;Torquilstone is ours!&mdash;Think of honour, think of  spoil&mdash;One effort, and the place is ours!&rdquo;          With that he bent his good bow, and sent a shaft right through the breast of  one of the men-at-arms, who, under De Bracy&rsquo;s direction, was loosening a  fragment from one of the battlements to precipitate on the heads of Cedric and  the Black Knight. A second soldier caught from the hands of the dying man the  iron crow, with which he heaved at and had loosened the stone pinnacle, when,  receiving an arrow through his head-piece, he dropped from the battlements into  the moat a dead man. The men-at-arms were daunted, for no armour seemed proof  against the shot of this tremendous archer.          &ldquo;Do you give ground, base knaves!&rdquo; said De Bracy;  &ldquo;&lsquo;Mount joye Saint Dennis!&rsquo;&mdash;Give me the lever!&rdquo;          And, snatching it up, he again assailed the loosened pinnacle, which was of  weight enough, if thrown down, not only to have destroyed the remnant of the  drawbridge, which sheltered the two foremost assailants, but also to have sunk  the rude float of planks over which they had crossed. All saw the danger, and  the boldest, even the stout Friar himself, avoided setting foot on the raft.  Thrice did Locksley bend his shaft against De Bracy, and thrice did his arrow  bound back from the knight&rsquo;s armour of proof.          &ldquo;Curse on thy Spanish steel-coat!&rdquo; said Locksley, &ldquo;had  English smith forged it, these arrows had gone through, an as if it had been  silk or sendal.&rdquo; He then began to call out, &ldquo;Comrades! friends!  noble Cedric! bear back, and let the ruin fall.&rdquo;          His warning voice was unheard, for the din which the knight himself occasioned  by his strokes upon the postern would have drowned twenty war-trumpets. The  faithful Gurth indeed sprung forward on the planked bridge, to warn Cedric of  his impending fate, or to share it with him. But his warning would have come  too late; the massive pinnacle already tottered, and De Bracy, who still heaved  at his task, would have accomplished it, had not the voice of the Templar  sounded close in his ears:&mdash;          &ldquo;All is lost, De Bracy, the castle burns.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou art mad to say so!&rdquo; replied the knight.          &ldquo;It is all in a light flame on the western side. I have striven in vain  to extinguish it.&rdquo;          With the stern coolness which formed the basis of his character, Brian de  Bois-Guilbert communicated this hideous intelligence, which was not so calmly  received by his astonished comrade.          &ldquo;Saints of Paradise!&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;what is to be done? I  vow to Saint Nicholas of Limoges a candlestick of pure gold&mdash;&rdquo;          &ldquo;Spare thy vow,&rdquo; said the Templar, &ldquo;and mark me. Lead thy men  down, as if to a sally; throw the postern-gate open&mdash;There are but two men  who occupy the float, fling them into the moat, and push across for the  barbican. I will charge from the main gate, and attack the barbican on the  outside; and if we can regain that post, be assured we shall defend ourselves  until we are relieved, or at least till they grant us fair quarter.&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is well thought upon,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;I will play my  part&mdash;Templar, thou wilt not fail me?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Hand and glove, I will not!&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert. &ldquo;But haste  thee, in the name of God!&rdquo;          De Bracy hastily drew his men together, and rushed down to the postern-gate,  which he caused instantly to be thrown open. But scarce was this done ere the  portentous strength of the Black Knight forced his way inward in despite of De  Bracy and his followers. Two of the foremost instantly fell, and the rest gave  way notwithstanding all their leader&rsquo;s efforts to stop them.          &ldquo;Dogs!&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;will ye let TWO men win our only pass  for safety?&rdquo;          &ldquo;He is the devil!&rdquo; said a veteran man-at-arms, bearing back from  the blows of their sable antagonist.          &ldquo;And if he be the devil,&rdquo; replied De Bracy, &ldquo;would you fly  from him into the mouth of hell?&mdash;the castle burns behind us,  villains!&mdash;let despair give you courage, or let me forward! I will cope  with this champion myself.&rdquo;          And well and chivalrous did De Bracy that day maintain the fame he had acquired  in the civil wars of that dreadful period. The vaulted passage to which the  postern gave entrance, and in which these two redoubted champions were now  fighting hand to hand, rung with the furious blows which they dealt each other,  De Bracy with his sword, the Black Knight with his ponderous axe. At length the  Norman received a blow, which, though its force was partly parried by his  shield, for otherwise never more would De Bracy have again moved limb,  descended yet with such violence on his crest, that he measured his length on  the paved floor.          &ldquo;Yield thee, De Bracy,&rdquo; said the Black Champion, stooping over him,  and holding against the bars of his helmet the fatal poniard with which the  knights dispatched their enemies, (and which was called the dagger of  mercy,)&mdash;&ldquo;yield thee, Maurice de Bracy, rescue or no rescue, or thou  art but a dead man.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I will not yield,&rdquo; replied De Bracy faintly, &ldquo;to an unknown  conqueror. Tell me thy name, or work thy pleasure on me&mdash;it shall never be  said that Maurice de Bracy was prisoner to a nameless churl.&rdquo;          The Black Knight whispered something into the ear of the vanquished.          &ldquo;I yield me to be true prisoner, rescue or no rescue,&rdquo; answered the  Norman, exchanging his tone of stern and determined obstinacy for one of deep  though sullen submission.          &ldquo;Go to the barbican,&rdquo; said the victor, in a tone of authority,  &ldquo;and there wait my further orders.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Yet first, let me say,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;what it imports thee  to know. Wilfred of Ivanhoe is wounded and a prisoner, and will perish in the  burning castle without present help.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Wilfred of Ivanhoe!&rdquo; exclaimed the Black  Knight&mdash;&ldquo;prisoner, and perish!&mdash;The life of every man in the  castle shall answer it if a hair of his head be singed&mdash;Show me his  chamber!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ascend yonder winding stair,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;it leads to  his apartment&mdash;Wilt thou not accept my guidance?&rdquo; he added, in a  submissive voice.          &ldquo;No. To the barbican, and there wait my orders. I trust thee not, De  Bracy.&rdquo;          During this combat and the brief conversation which ensued, Cedric, at the head  of a body of men, among whom the Friar was conspicuous, had pushed across the  bridge as soon as they saw the postern open, and drove back the dispirited and  despairing followers of De Bracy, of whom some asked quarter, some offered vain  resistance, and the greater part fled towards the court-yard. De Bracy himself  arose from the ground, and cast a sorrowful glance after his conqueror.  &ldquo;He trusts me not!&rdquo; he repeated; &ldquo;but have I deserved his  trust?&rdquo; He then lifted his sword from the floor, took off his helmet in  token of submission, and, going to the barbican, gave up his sword to Locksley,  whom he met by the way.          As the fire augmented, symptoms of it became soon apparent in the chamber,  where Ivanhoe was watched and tended by the Jewess Rebecca. He had been  awakened from his brief slumber by the noise of the battle; and his attendant,  who had, at his anxious desire, again placed herself at the window to watch and  report to him the fate of the attack, was for some time prevented from  observing either, by the increase of the smouldering and stifling vapour. At  length the volumes of smoke which rolled into the apartment&mdash;the cries for  water, which were heard even above the din of the battle made them sensible of  the progress of this new danger.          &ldquo;The castle burns,&rdquo; said Rebecca; &ldquo;it burns!&mdash;What can  we do to save ourselves?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Fly, Rebecca, and save thine own life,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe, &ldquo;for  no human aid can avail me.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I will not fly,&rdquo; answered Rebecca; &ldquo;we will be saved or  perish together&mdash;And yet, great God!&mdash;my father, my father&mdash;what  will be his fate!&rdquo;          At this moment the door of the apartment flew open, and the Templar presented  himself,&mdash;a ghastly figure, for his gilded armour was broken and bloody,  and the plume was partly shorn away, partly burnt from his casque. &ldquo;I  have found thee,&rdquo; said he to Rebecca; &ldquo;thou shalt prove I will keep  my word to share weal and woe with thee&mdash;There is but one path to safety,  I have cut my way through fifty dangers to point it to thee&mdash;up, and  instantly follow me!&rdquo;   38            &ldquo;Alone,&rdquo; answered Rebecca, &ldquo;I will not follow thee. If thou  wert born of woman&mdash;if thou hast but a touch of human charity in  thee&mdash;if thy heart be not hard as thy breastplate&mdash;save my aged  father&mdash;save this wounded knight!&rdquo;          &ldquo;A knight,&rdquo; answered the Templar, with his characteristic calmness,  &ldquo;a knight, Rebecca, must encounter his fate, whether it meet him in the  shape of sword or flame&mdash;and who recks how or where a Jew meets with  his?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Savage warrior,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;rather will I perish in the  flames than accept safety from thee!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou shalt not choose, Rebecca&mdash;once didst thou foil me, but never  mortal did so twice.&rdquo;          So saying, he seized on the terrified maiden, who filled the air with her  shrieks, and bore her out of the room in his arms in spite of her cries, and  without regarding the menaces and defiance which Ivanhoe thundered against him.  &ldquo;Hound of the Temple&mdash;stain to thine Order&mdash;set free the  damsel! Traitor of Bois-Guilbert, it is Ivanhoe commands thee!&mdash;Villain, I  will have thy heart&rsquo;s blood!&rdquo;                      &ldquo;I had not found thee, Wilfred,&rdquo; said the Black Knight, who at that  instant entered the apartment, &ldquo;but for thy shouts.&rdquo;          &ldquo;If thou be&rsquo;st true knight,&rdquo; said Wilfred, &ldquo;think not  of me&mdash;pursue yon ravisher&mdash;save the Lady Rowena&mdash;look to the  noble Cedric!&rdquo;          &ldquo;In their turn,&rdquo; answered he of the Fetterlock, &ldquo;but thine is  first.&rdquo;          And seizing upon Ivanhoe, he bore him off with as much ease as the Templar had  carried off Rebecca, rushed with him to the postern, and having there delivered  his burden to the care of two yeomen, he again entered the castle to assist in  the rescue of the other prisoners.          One turret was now in bright flames, which flashed out furiously from window  and shot-hole. But in other parts, the great thickness of the walls and the  vaulted roofs of the apartments, resisted the progress of the flames, and there  the rage of man still triumphed, as the scarce more dreadful element held  mastery elsewhere; for the besiegers pursued the defenders of the castle from  chamber to chamber, and satiated in their blood the vengeance which had long  animated them against the soldiers of the tyrant Front-de-Bœuf. Most of the  garrison resisted to the uttermost&mdash;few of them asked quarter&mdash;none  received it. The air was filled with groans and clashing of arms&mdash;the  floors were slippery with the blood of despairing and expiring wretches.          Through this scene of confusion, Cedric rushed in quest of Rowena, while the  faithful Gurth, following him closely through the &ldquo;melee&rdquo;,  neglected his own safety while he strove to avert the blows that were aimed at  his master. The noble Saxon was so fortunate as to reach his ward&rsquo;s  apartment just as she had abandoned all hope of safety, and, with a crucifix  clasped in agony to her bosom, sat in expectation of instant death. He  committed her to the charge of Gurth, to be conducted in safety to the  barbican, the road to which was now cleared of the enemy, and not yet  interrupted by the flames. This accomplished, the loyal Cedric hastened in  quest of his friend Athelstane, determined, at every risk to himself, to save  that last scion of Saxon royalty. But ere Cedric penetrated as far as the old  hall in which he had himself been a prisoner, the inventive genius of Wamba had  procured liberation for himself and his companion in adversity.          When the noise of the conflict announced that it was at the hottest, the Jester  began to shout, with the utmost power of his lungs, &ldquo;Saint George and the  dragon!&mdash;Bonny Saint George for merry England!&mdash;The castle is  won!&rdquo; And these sounds he rendered yet more fearful, by banging against  each other two or three pieces of rusty armour which lay scattered around the  hall.          A guard, which had been stationed in the outer, or anteroom, and whose spirits  were already in a state of alarm, took fright at Wamba&rsquo;s clamour, and,  leaving the door open behind them, ran to tell the Templar that foemen had  entered the old hall. Meantime the prisoners found no difficulty in making  their escape into the anteroom, and from thence into the court of the castle,  which was now the last scene of contest. Here sat the fierce Templar, mounted  on horseback, surrounded by several of the garrison both on horse and foot, who  had united their strength to that of this renowned leader, in order to secure  the last chance of safety and retreat which remained to them. The drawbridge  had been lowered by his orders, but the passage was beset; for the archers, who  had hitherto only annoyed the castle on that side by their missiles, no sooner  saw the flames breaking out, and the bridge lowered, than they thronged to the  entrance, as well to prevent the escape of the garrison, as to secure their own  share of booty ere the castle should be burnt down. On the other hand, a party  of the besiegers who had entered by the postern were now issuing out into the  court-yard, and attacking with fury the remnant of the defenders who were thus  assaulted on both sides at once.          Animated, however, by despair, and supported by the example of their  indomitable leader, the remaining soldiers of the castle fought with the utmost  valour; and, being well-armed, succeeded more than once in driving back the  assailants, though much inferior in numbers. Rebecca, placed on horseback  before one of the Templar&rsquo;s Saracen slaves, was in the midst of the  little party; and Bois-Guilbert, notwithstanding the confusion of the bloody  fray, showed every attention to her safety. Repeatedly he was by her side, and,  neglecting his own defence, held before her the fence of his triangular  steel-plated shield; and anon starting from his position by her, he cried his  war-cry, dashed forward, struck to earth the most forward of the assailants,  and was on the same instant once more at her bridle rein.          Athelstane, who, as the reader knows, was slothful, but not cowardly, beheld  the female form whom the Templar protected thus sedulously, and doubted not  that it was Rowena whom the knight was carrying off, in despite of all  resistance which could be offered.          &ldquo;By the soul of Saint Edward,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will rescue her  from yonder over-proud knight, and he shall die by my hand!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Think what you do!&rdquo; cried Wamba; &ldquo;hasty hand catches frog  for fish&mdash;by my bauble, yonder is none of my Lady Rowena&mdash;see but her  long dark locks!&mdash;Nay, an ye will not know black from white, ye may be  leader, but I will be no follower&mdash;no bones of mine shall be broken unless  I know for whom.&mdash;And you without armour too!&mdash;Bethink you, silk  bonnet never kept out steel blade.&mdash;Nay, then, if wilful will to water,  wilful must drench.&mdash;&lsquo;Deus vobiscum&rsquo;, most doughty  Athelstane!&rdquo;&mdash;he concluded, loosening the hold which he had hitherto  kept upon the Saxon&rsquo;s tunic.          To snatch a mace from the pavement, on which it lay beside one whose dying  grasp had just relinquished it&mdash;to rush on the Templar&rsquo;s band, and  to strike in quick succession to the right and left, levelling a warrior at  each blow, was, for Athelstane&rsquo;s great strength, now animated with  unusual fury, but the work of a single moment; he was soon within two yards of  Bois-Guilbert, whom he defied in his loudest tone.          &ldquo;Turn, false-hearted Templar! let go her whom thou art unworthy to  touch&mdash;turn, limb of a hand of murdering and hypocritical robbers!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Dog!&rdquo; said the Templar, grinding his teeth, &ldquo;I will teach  thee to blaspheme the holy Order of the Temple of Zion;&rdquo; and with these  words, half-wheeling his steed, he made a demi-courbette towards the Saxon, and  rising in the stirrups, so as to take full advantage of the descent of the  horse, he discharged a fearful blow upon the head of Athelstane.          Well said Wamba, that silken bonnet keeps out no steel blade. So trenchant was  the Templar&rsquo;s weapon, that it shore asunder, as it had been a willow  twig, the tough and plaited handle of the mace, which the ill-fated Saxon  reared to parry the blow, and, descending on his head, levelled him with the  earth.          &ldquo;&lsquo;Ha! Beau-seant!&rsquo;&rdquo; exclaimed Bois-Guilbert,  &ldquo;thus be it to the maligners of the Temple-knights!&rdquo; Taking  advantage of the dismay which was spread by the fall of Athelstane, and calling  aloud, &ldquo;Those who would save themselves, follow me!&rdquo; he pushed  across the drawbridge, dispersing the archers who would have intercepted them.  He was followed by his Saracens, and some five or six men-at-arms, who had  mounted their horses. The Templar&rsquo;s retreat was rendered perilous by the  numbers of arrows shot off at him and his party; but this did not prevent him  from galloping round to the barbican, of which, according to his previous plan,  he supposed it possible De Bracy might have been in possession.          &ldquo;De Bracy! De Bracy!&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;art thou there?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I am here,&rdquo; replied De Bracy, &ldquo;but I am a prisoner.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Can I rescue thee?&rdquo; cried Bois-Guilbert.          &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied De Bracy; &ldquo;I have rendered me, rescue or no  rescue. I will be true prisoner. Save thyself&mdash;there are hawks  abroad&mdash;put the seas betwixt you and England&mdash;I dare not say  more.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered the Templar, &ldquo;an thou wilt tarry there,  remember I have redeemed word and glove. Be the hawks where they will, methinks  the walls of the Preceptory of Templestowe will be cover sufficient, and  thither will I, like heron to her haunt.&rdquo;          Having thus spoken, he galloped off with his followers.          Those of the castle who had not gotten to horse, still continued to fight  desperately with the besiegers, after the departure of the Templar, but rather  in despair of quarter than that they entertained any hope of escape. The fire  was spreading rapidly through all parts of the castle, when Ulrica, who had  first kindled it, appeared on a turret, in the guise of one of the ancient  furies, yelling forth a war-song, such as was of yore raised on the field of  battle by the scalds of the yet heathen Saxons. Her long dishevelled grey hair  flew back from her uncovered head; the inebriating delight of gratified  vengeance contended in her eyes with the fire of insanity; and she brandished  the distaff which she held in her hand, as if she had been one of the Fatal  Sisters, who spin and abridge the thread of human life. Tradition has preserved  some wild strophes of the barbarous hymn which she chanted wildly amid that  scene of fire and of slaughter:&mdash;          1.   Whet the bright steel,   Sons of the White Dragon!   Kindle the torch,   Daughter of Hengist!   The steel glimmers not for the carving of the banquet,   It is hard, broad, and sharply pointed;   The torch goeth not to the bridal chamber,   It steams and glitters blue with sulphur.   Whet the steel, the raven croaks!   Light the torch, Zernebock is yelling!   Whet the steel, sons of the Dragon!   Kindle the torch, daughter of Hengist!      2.   The black cloud is low over the thane&rsquo;s castle   The eagle screams&mdash;he rides on its bosom.   Scream not, grey rider of the sable cloud,   Thy banquet is prepared!   The maidens of Valhalla look forth,   The race of Hengist will send them guests.   Shake your black tresses, maidens of Valhalla!   And strike your loud timbrels for joy!   Many a haughty step bends to your halls,   Many a helmed head.      3.   Dark sits the evening upon the thanes castle,   The black clouds gather round;   Soon shall they be red as the blood of the valiant!   The destroyer of forests shall shake his red crest against   them.   He, the bright consumer of palaces,   Broad waves he his blazing banner,   Red, wide and dusky,   Over the strife of the valiant:   His joy is in the clashing swords and broken bucklers;   He loves to lick the hissing blood as it bursts warm from the   wound!      4.   All must perish!   The sword cleaveth the helmet;   The strong armour is pierced by the lance;   Fire devoureth the dwelling of princes,   Engines break down the fences of the battle.   All must perish!   The race of Hengist is gone&mdash;   The name of Horsa is no more!   Shrink not then from your doom, sons of the sword!   Let your blades drink blood like wine;   Feast ye in the banquet of slaughter,   By the light of the blazing halls!   Strong be your swords while your blood is warm,   And spare neither for pity nor fear,   For vengeance hath but an hour;   Strong hate itself shall expire   I also must perish!  39           The towering flames had now surmounted every obstruction, and rose to the  evening skies one huge and burning beacon, seen far and wide through the  adjacent country. Tower after tower crashed down, with blazing roof and rafter;  and the combatants were driven from the court-yard. The vanquished, of whom  very few remained, scattered and escaped into the neighbouring wood. The  victors, assembling in large bands, gazed with wonder, not unmixed with fear,  upon the flames, in which their own ranks and arms glanced dusky red. The  maniac figure of the Saxon Ulrica was for a long time visible on the lofty  stand she had chosen, tossing her arms abroad with wild exultation, as if she  reined empress of the conflagration which she had raised. At length, with a  terrific crash, the whole turret gave way, and she perished in the flames which  had consumed her tyrant. An awful pause of horror silenced each murmur of the  armed spectators, who, for the space of several minutes, stirred not a finger,  save to sign the cross. The voice of Locksley was then heard, &ldquo;Shout,  yeomen!&mdash;the den of tyrants is no more! Let each bring his spoil to our  chosen place of rendezvous at the Trysting-tree in the Harthill-walk; for there  at break of day will we make just partition among our own bands, together with  our worthy allies in this great deed of vengeance.&rdquo;                     CHAPTER XXXII.        Trust me each state must have its policies:   Kingdoms have edicts, cities have their charters;   Even the wild outlaw, in his forest-walk,   Keeps yet some touch of civil discipline;   For not since Adam wore his verdant apron,   Hath man with man in social union dwelt,   But laws were made to draw that union closer.          O LD  P LAY           The daylight had dawned upon the glades of the oak forest. The green boughs  glittered with all their pearls of dew. The hind led her fawn from the covert  of high fern to the more open walks of the greenwood, and no huntsman was there  to watch or intercept the stately hart, as he paced at the head of the  antler&rsquo;d herd.          The outlaws were all assembled around the Trysting-tree in the Harthill-walk,  where they had spent the night in refreshing themselves after the fatigues of  the siege, some with wine, some with slumber, many with hearing and recounting  the events of the day, and computing the heaps of plunder which their success  had placed at the disposal of their Chief.          The spoils were indeed very large; for, notwithstanding that much was consumed,  a great deal of plate, rich armour, and splendid clothing, had been secured by  the exertions of the dauntless outlaws, who could be appalled by no danger when  such rewards were in view. Yet so strict were the laws of their society, that  no one ventured to appropriate any part of the booty, which was brought into  one common mass, to be at the disposal of their leader.          The place of rendezvous was an aged oak; not however the same to which Locksley  had conducted Gurth and Wamba in the earlier part of the story, but one which  was the centre of a silvan amphitheatre, within half a mile of the demolished  castle of Torquilstone. Here Locksley assumed his seat&mdash;a throne of turf  erected under the twisted branches of the huge oak, and the silvan followers  were gathered around him. He assigned to the Black Knight a seat at his right  hand, and to Cedric a place upon his left.          &ldquo;Pardon my freedom, noble sirs,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but in these  glades I am monarch&mdash;they are my kingdom; and these my wild subjects would  reck but little of my power, were I, within my own dominions, to yield place to  mortal man.&mdash;Now, sirs, who hath seen our chaplain? where is our curtal  Friar? A mass amongst Christian men best begins a busy morning.&rdquo;&mdash;No  one had seen the Clerk of Copmanhurst. &ldquo;Over gods forbode!&rdquo; said  the outlaw chief, &ldquo;I trust the jolly priest hath but abidden by the  wine-pot a thought too late. Who saw him since the castle was  ta&rsquo;en?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I,&rdquo; quoth the Miller, &ldquo;marked him busy about the door of a  cellar, swearing by each saint in the calendar he would taste the smack of  Front-de-Bœuf&rsquo;s Gascoigne wine.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Now, the saints, as many as there be of them,&rdquo; said the Captain,  &ldquo;forefend, lest he has drunk too deep of the wine-butts, and perished by  the fall of the castle!&mdash;Away, Miller!&mdash;take with you enow of men,  seek the place where you last saw him&mdash;throw water from the moat on the  scorching ruins&mdash;I will have them removed stone by stone ere I lose my  curtal Friar.&rdquo;          The numbers who hastened to execute this duty, considering that an interesting  division of spoil was about to take place, showed how much the troop had at  heart the safety of their spiritual father.          &ldquo;Meanwhile, let us proceed,&rdquo; said Locksley; &ldquo;for when this  bold deed shall be sounded abroad, the bands of De Bracy, of Malvoisin, and  other allies of Front-de-Bœuf, will be in motion against us, and it were well  for our safety that we retreat from the vicinity.&mdash;Noble Cedric,&rdquo; he  said, turning to the Saxon, &ldquo;that spoil is divided into two portions; do  thou make choice of that which best suits thee, to recompense thy people who  were partakers with us in this adventure.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Good yeoman,&rdquo; said Cedric, &ldquo;my heart is oppressed with  sadness. The noble Athelstane of Coningsburgh is no more&mdash;the last sprout  of the sainted Confessor! Hopes have perished with him which can never  return!&mdash;A sparkle hath been quenched by his blood, which no human breath  can again rekindle! My people, save the few who are now with me, do but tarry  my presence to transport his honoured remains to their last mansion. The Lady  Rowena is desirous to return to Rotherwood, and must be escorted by a  sufficient force. I should, therefore, ere now, have left this place; and I  waited&mdash;not to share the booty, for, so help me God and Saint Withold! as  neither I nor any of mine will touch the value of a liard,&mdash;I waited but  to render my thanks to thee and to thy bold yeomen, for the life and honour ye  have saved.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay, but,&rdquo; said the chief Outlaw, &ldquo;we did but half the work  at most&mdash;take of the spoil what may reward your own neighbours and  followers.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I am rich enough to reward them from mine own wealth,&rdquo; answered  Cedric.          &ldquo;And some,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;have been wise enough to reward  themselves; they do not march off empty-handed altogether. We do not all wear  motley.&rdquo;          &ldquo;They are welcome,&rdquo; said Locksley; &ldquo;our laws bind none but  ourselves.&rdquo;          &ldquo;But, thou, my poor knave,&rdquo; said Cedric, turning about and  embracing his Jester, &ldquo;how shall I reward thee, who feared not to give  thy body to chains and death instead of mine!&mdash;All forsook me, when the  poor fool was faithful!&rdquo;          A tear stood in the eye of the rough Thane as he spoke&mdash;a mark of feeling  which even the death of Athelstane had not extracted; but there was something  in the half-instinctive attachment of his clown, that waked his nature more  keenly than even grief itself.          &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the Jester, extricating himself from master&rsquo;s  caress, &ldquo;if you pay my service with the water of your eye, the Jester  must weep for company, and then what becomes of his vocation?&mdash;But, uncle,  if you would indeed pleasure me, I pray you to pardon my playfellow Gurth, who  stole a week from your service to bestow it on your son.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Pardon him!&rdquo; exclaimed Cedric; &ldquo;I will both pardon and  reward him.&mdash;Kneel down, Gurth.&rdquo;&mdash;The swineherd was in an  instant at his master&rsquo;s feet&mdash;&ldquo;THEOW and ESNE   40   art thou no longer,&rdquo; said  Cedric touching him with a wand; &ldquo;FOLKFREE and SACLESS   41   art thou in town and from town, in  the forest as in the field. A hide of land I give to thee in my steads of  Walbrugham, from me and mine to thee and thine aye and for ever; and  God&rsquo;s malison on his head who this gainsays!&rdquo;          No longer a serf, but a freeman and a landholder, Gurth sprung upon his feet,  and twice bounded aloft to almost his own height from the ground. &ldquo;A  smith and a file,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;to do away the collar from the neck  of a freeman!&mdash;Noble master! doubled is my strength by your gift, and  doubly will I fight for you!&mdash;There is a free spirit in my breast&mdash;I  am a man changed to myself and all around.&mdash;Ha, Fangs!&rdquo; he  continued,&mdash;for that faithful cur, seeing his master thus transported,  began to jump upon him, to express his sympathy,&mdash;&ldquo;knowest thou thy  master still?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;Fangs and I still know thee, Gurth, though  we must needs abide by the collar; it is only thou art likely to forget both us  and thyself.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I shall forget myself indeed ere I forget thee, true comrade,&rdquo;  said Gurth; &ldquo;and were freedom fit for thee, Wamba, the master would not  let thee want it.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;never think I envy thee, brother Gurth;  the serf sits by the hall-fire when the freeman must forth to the field of  battle&mdash;And what saith Oldhelm of Malmsbury&mdash;Better a fool at a feast  than a wise man at a fray.&rdquo;          The tramp of horses was now heard, and the Lady Rowena appeared, surrounded by  several riders, and a much stronger party of footmen, who joyfully shook their  pikes and clashed their brown-bills for joy of her freedom. She herself, richly  attired, and mounted on a dark chestnut palfrey, had recovered all the dignity  of her manner, and only an unwonted degree of paleness showed the sufferings  she had undergone. Her lovely brow, though sorrowful, bore on it a cast of  reviving hope for the future, as well as of grateful thankfulness for the past  deliverance&mdash;She knew that Ivanhoe was safe, and she knew that Athelstane  was dead. The former assurance filled her with the most sincere delight; and if  she did not absolutely rejoice at the latter, she might be pardoned for feeling  the full advantage of being freed from further persecution on the only subject  in which she had ever been contradicted by her guardian Cedric.          As Rowena bent her steed towards Locksley&rsquo;s seat, that bold yeoman, with  all his followers, rose to receive her, as if by a general instinct of  courtesy. The blood rose to her cheeks, as, courteously waving her hand, and  bending so low that her beautiful and loose tresses were for an instant mixed  with the flowing mane of her palfrey, she expressed in few but apt words her  obligations and her gratitude to Locksley and her other  deliverers.&mdash;&ldquo;God bless you, brave men,&rdquo; she concluded,  &ldquo;God and Our Lady bless you and requite you for gallantly perilling  yourselves in the cause of the oppressed!&mdash;If any of you should hunger,  remember Rowena has food&mdash;if you should thirst, she has many a butt of  wine and brown ale&mdash;and if the Normans drive ye from these walks, Rowena  has forests of her own, where her gallant deliverers may range at full freedom,  and never ranger ask whose arrow hath struck down the deer.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thanks, gentle lady,&rdquo; said Locksley; &ldquo;thanks from my company  and myself. But, to have saved you requites itself. We who walk the greenwood  do many a wild deed, and the Lady Rowena&rsquo;s deliverance may be received as  an atonement.&rdquo;          Again bowing from her palfrey, Rowena turned to depart; but pausing a moment,  while Cedric, who was to attend her, was also taking his leave, she found  herself unexpectedly close by the prisoner De Bracy. He stood under a tree in  deep meditation, his arms crossed upon his breast, and Rowena was in hopes she  might pass him unobserved. He looked up, however, and, when aware of her  presence, a deep flush of shame suffused his handsome countenance. He stood a  moment most irresolute; then, stepping forward, took her palfrey by the rein,  and bent his knee before her.          &ldquo;Will the Lady Rowena deign to cast an eye&mdash;on a captive  knight&mdash;on a dishonoured soldier?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Sir Knight,&rdquo; answered Rowena, &ldquo;in enterprises such as yours,  the real dishonour lies not in failure, but in success.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Conquest, lady, should soften the heart,&rdquo; answered De Bracy;  &ldquo;let me but know that the Lady Rowena forgives the violence occasioned by  an ill-fated passion, and she shall soon learn that De Bracy knows how to serve  her in nobler ways.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I forgive you, Sir Knight,&rdquo; said Rowena, &ldquo;as a  Christian.&rdquo;          &ldquo;That means,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;that she does not forgive him at  all.&rdquo;          &ldquo;But I can never forgive the misery and desolation your madness has  occasioned,&rdquo; continued Rowena.          &ldquo;Unloose your hold on the lady&rsquo;s rein,&rdquo; said Cedric, coming  up. &ldquo;By the bright sun above us, but it were shame, I would pin thee to  the earth with my javelin&mdash;but be well assured, thou shalt smart, Maurice  de Bracy, for thy share in this foul deed.&rdquo;          &ldquo;He threatens safely who threatens a prisoner,&rdquo; said De Bracy;  &ldquo;but when had a Saxon any touch of courtesy?&rdquo;          Then retiring two steps backward, he permitted the lady to move on.          Cedric, ere they departed, expressed his peculiar gratitude to the Black  Champion, and earnestly entreated him to accompany him to Rotherwood.          &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that ye errant knights desire to carry  your fortunes on the point of your lance, and reck not of land or goods; but  war is a changeful mistress, and a home is sometimes desirable even to the  champion whose trade is wandering. Thou hast earned one in the halls of  Rotherwood, noble knight. Cedric has wealth enough to repair the injuries of  fortune, and all he has is his deliverer&rsquo;s&mdash;Come, therefore, to  Rotherwood, not as a guest, but as a son or brother.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Cedric has already made me rich,&rdquo; said the Knight,&mdash;&ldquo;he  has taught me the value of Saxon virtue. To Rotherwood will I come, brave  Saxon, and that speedily; but, as now, pressing matters of moment detain me  from your halls. Peradventure when I come hither, I will ask such a boon as  will put even thy generosity to the test.&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is granted ere spoken out,&rdquo; said Cedric, striking his ready  hand into the gauntleted palm of the Black Knight,&mdash;&ldquo;it is granted  already, were it to affect half my fortune.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Gage not thy promise so lightly,&rdquo; said the Knight of the  Fetterlock; &ldquo;yet well I hope to gain the boon I shall ask. Meanwhile,  adieu.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I have but to say,&rdquo; added the Saxon, &ldquo;that, during the  funeral rites of the noble Athelstane, I shall be an inhabitant of the halls of  his castle of Coningsburgh&mdash;They will be open to all who choose to partake  of the funeral banqueting; and, I speak in name of the noble Edith, mother of  the fallen prince, they will never be shut against him who laboured so bravely,  though unsuccessfully, to save Athelstane from Norman chains and Norman  steel.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said Wamba, who had resumed his attendance on his master,  &ldquo;rare feeding there will be&mdash;pity that the noble Athelstane cannot  banquet at his own funeral.&mdash;But he,&rdquo; continued the Jester, lifting  up his eyes gravely, &ldquo;is supping in Paradise, and doubtless does honour  to the cheer.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Peace, and move on,&rdquo; said Cedric, his anger at this untimely jest  being checked by the recollection of Wamba&rsquo;s recent services. Rowena  waved a graceful adieu to him of the Fetterlock&mdash;the Saxon bade God speed  him, and on they moved through a wide glade of the forest.          They had scarce departed, ere a sudden procession moved from under the  greenwood branches, swept slowly round the silvan amphitheatre, and took the  same direction with Rowena and her followers. The priests of a neighbouring  convent, in expectation of the ample donation, or &ldquo;soul-scat&rdquo;,  which Cedric had propined, attended upon the car in which the body of  Athelstane was laid, and sang hymns as it was sadly and slowly borne on the  shoulders of his vassals to his castle of Coningsburgh, to be there deposited  in the grave of Hengist, from whom the deceased derived his long descent. Many  of his vassals had assembled at the news of his death, and followed the bier  with all the external marks, at least, of dejection and sorrow. Again the  outlaws arose, and paid the same rude and spontaneous homage to death, which  they had so lately rendered to beauty&mdash;the slow chant and mournful step of  the priests brought back to their remembrance such of their comrades as had  fallen in the yesterday&rsquo;s array. But such recollections dwell not long  with those who lead a life of danger and enterprise, and ere the sound of the  death-hymn had died on the wind, the outlaws were again busied in the  distribution of their spoil.          &ldquo;Valiant knight,&rdquo; said Locksley to the Black Champion,  &ldquo;without whose good heart and mighty arm our enterprise must altogether  have failed, will it please you to take from that mass of spoil whatever may  best serve to pleasure you, and to remind you of this my Trysting-tree?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I accept the offer,&rdquo; said the Knight, &ldquo;as frankly as it is  given; and I ask permission to dispose of Sir Maurice de Bracy at my own  pleasure.&rdquo;          &ldquo;He is thine already,&rdquo; said Locksley, &ldquo;and well for him! else  the tyrant had graced the highest bough of this oak, with as many of his  Free-Companions as we could gather, hanging thick as acorns around  him.&mdash;But he is thy prisoner, and he is safe, though he had slain my  father.&rdquo;          &ldquo;De Bracy,&rdquo; said the Knight, &ldquo;thou art free&mdash;depart. He  whose prisoner thou art scorns to take mean revenge for what is past. But  beware of the future, lest a worse thing befall thee.&mdash;Maurice de Bracy, I  say BEWARE!&rdquo;          De Bracy bowed low and in silence, and was about to withdraw, when the yeomen  burst at once into a shout of execration and derision. The proud knight  instantly stopped, turned back, folded his arms, drew up his form to its full  height, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Peace, ye yelping curs! who open upon a cry which  ye followed not when the stag was at bay&mdash;De Bracy scorns your censure as  he would disdain your applause. To your brakes and caves, ye outlawed thieves!  and be silent when aught knightly or noble is but spoken within a league of  your fox-earths.&rdquo;          This ill-timed defiance might have procured for De Bracy a volley of arrows,  but for the hasty and imperative interference of the outlaw Chief. Meanwhile  the knight caught a horse by the rein, for several which had been taken in the  stables of Front-de-Bœuf stood accoutred around, and were a valuable part of  the booty. He threw himself upon the saddle, and galloped off through the wood.          When the bustle occasioned by this incident was somewhat composed, the chief  Outlaw took from his neck the rich horn and baldric which he had recently  gained at the strife of archery near Ashby.          &ldquo;Noble knight.&rdquo; he said to him of the Fetterlock, &ldquo;if you  disdain not to grace by your acceptance a bugle which an English yeoman has  once worn, this I will pray you to keep as a memorial of your gallant  bearing&mdash;and if ye have aught to do, and, as happeneth oft to a gallant  knight, ye chance to be hard bested in any forest between Trent and Tees, wind  three mots   42   upon the horn thus,  &lsquo;Wa-sa-hoa!&rsquo; and it may well chance ye shall find helpers and  rescue.&rdquo;          He then gave breath to the bugle, and winded once and again the call which he  described, until the knight had caught the notes.          &ldquo;Gramercy for the gift, bold yeoman,&rdquo; said the Knight; &ldquo;and  better help than thine and thy rangers would I never seek, were it at my utmost  need.&rdquo; And then in his turn he winded the call till all the greenwood  rang.          &ldquo;Well blown and clearly,&rdquo; said the yeoman; &ldquo;beshrew me an  thou knowest not as much of woodcraft as of war!&mdash;thou hast been a striker  of deer in thy day, I warrant.&mdash;Comrades, mark these three mots&mdash;it  is the call of the Knight of the Fetterlock; and he who hears it, and hastens  not to serve him at his need, I will have him scourged out of our band with his  own bowstring.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Long live our leader!&rdquo; shouted the yeomen, &ldquo;and long live  the Black Knight of the Fetterlock!&mdash;May he soon use our service, to prove  how readily it will be paid.&rdquo;          Locksley now proceeded to the distribution of the spoil, which he performed  with the most laudable impartiality. A tenth part of the whole was set apart  for the church, and for pious uses; a portion was next allotted to a sort of  public treasury; a part was assigned to the widows and children of those who  had fallen, or to be expended in masses for the souls of such as had left no  surviving family. The rest was divided amongst the outlaws, according to their  rank and merit, and the judgment of the Chief, on all such doubtful questions  as occurred, was delivered with great shrewdness, and received with absolute  submission. The Black Knight was not a little surprised to find that men, in a  state so lawless, were nevertheless among themselves so regularly and equitably  governed, and all that he observed added to his opinion of the justice and  judgment of their leader.          When each had taken his own proportion of the booty, and while the treasurer,  accompanied by four tall yeomen, was transporting that belonging to the state  to some place of concealment or of security, the portion devoted to the church  still remained unappropriated.          &ldquo;I would,&rdquo; said the leader, &ldquo;we could hear tidings of our  joyous chaplain&mdash;he was never wont to be absent when meat was to be  blessed, or spoil to be parted; and it is his duty to take care of these the  tithes of our successful enterprise. It may be the office has helped to cover  some of his canonical irregularities. Also, I have a holy brother of his a  prisoner at no great distance, and I would fain have the Friar to help me to  deal with him in due sort&mdash;I greatly misdoubt the safety of the bluff  priest.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I were right sorry for that,&rdquo; said the Knight of the Fetterlock,  &ldquo;for I stand indebted to him for the joyous hospitality of a merry night  in his cell. Let us to the ruins of the castle; it may be we shall there learn  some tidings of him.&rdquo;          While they thus spoke, a loud shout among the yeomen announced the arrival of  him for whom they feared, as they learned from the stentorian voice of the  Friar himself, long before they saw his burly person.          &ldquo;Make room, my merry-men!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;room for your godly  father and his prisoner&mdash;Cry welcome once more.&mdash;I come, noble  leader, like an eagle with my prey in my clutch.&rdquo;&mdash;And making his  way through the ring, amidst the laughter of all around, he appeared in  majestic triumph, his huge partisan in one hand, and in the other a halter, one  end of which was fastened to the neck of the unfortunate Isaac of York, who,  bent down by sorrow and terror, was dragged on by the victorious priest, who  shouted aloud, &ldquo;Where is Allan-a-Dale, to chronicle me in a ballad, or if  it were but a lay?&mdash;By Saint Hermangild, the jingling crowder is ever out  of the way where there is an apt theme for exalting valour!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Curtal Priest,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;thou hast been at a wet  mass this morning, as early as it is. In the name of Saint Nicholas, whom hast  thou got here?&rdquo;          &ldquo;A captive to my sword and to my lance, noble Captain,&rdquo; replied the  Clerk of Copmanhurst; &ldquo;to my bow and to my halberd, I should rather say;  and yet I have redeemed him by my divinity from a worse captivity. Speak,  Jew&mdash;have I not ransomed thee from Sathanas?&mdash;have I not taught thee  thy &lsquo;credo&rsquo;, thy &lsquo;pater&rsquo;, and thine &lsquo;Ave  Maria&rsquo;?&mdash;Did I not spend the whole night in drinking to thee, and in  expounding of mysteries?&rdquo;          &ldquo;For the love of God!&rdquo; ejaculated the poor Jew, &ldquo;will no one  take me out of the keeping of this mad&mdash;I mean this holy man?&rdquo;          &ldquo;How&rsquo;s this, Jew?&rdquo; said the Friar, with a menacing aspect;  &ldquo;dost thou recant, Jew?&mdash;Bethink thee, if thou dost relapse into  thine infidelity, though thou are not so tender as a suckling pig&mdash;I would  I had one to break my fast upon&mdash;thou art not too tough to be roasted! Be  conformable, Isaac, and repeat the words after me. &lsquo;Ave  Maria&rsquo;!&mdash;&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay, we will have no profanation, mad Priest,&rdquo; said Locksley;  &ldquo;let us rather hear where you found this prisoner of thine.&rdquo;          &ldquo;By Saint Dunstan,&rdquo; said the Friar, &ldquo;I found him where I  sought for better ware! I did step into the cellarage to see what might be  rescued there; for though a cup of burnt wine, with spice, be an  evening&rsquo;s drought for an emperor, it were waste, methought, to let so  much good liquor be mulled at once; and I had caught up one runlet of sack, and  was coming to call more aid among these lazy knaves, who are ever to seek when  a good deed is to be done, when I was avised of a strong door&mdash;Aha!  thought I, here is the choicest juice of all in this secret crypt; and the  knave butler, being disturbed in his vocation, hath left the key in the  door&mdash;In therefore I went, and found just nought besides a commodity of  rusted chains and this dog of a Jew, who presently rendered himself my  prisoner, rescue or no rescue. I did but refresh myself after the fatigue of  the action, with the unbeliever, with one humming cup of sack, and was  proceeding to lead forth my captive, when, crash after crash, as with wild  thunder-dint and levin-fire, down toppled the masonry of an outer tower, (marry  beshrew their hands that built it not the firmer!) and blocked up the passage.  The roar of one falling tower followed another&mdash;I gave up thought of life;  and deeming it a dishonour to one of my profession to pass out of this world in  company with a Jew, I heaved up my halberd to beat his brains out; but I took  pity on his grey hairs, and judged it better to lay down the partisan, and take  up my spiritual weapon for his conversion. And truly, by the blessing of Saint  Dunstan, the seed has been sown in good soil; only that, with speaking to him  of mysteries through the whole night, and being in a manner fasting, (for the  few droughts of sack which I sharpened my wits with were not worth marking,) my  head is well-nigh dizzied, I trow.&mdash;But I was clean  exhausted.&mdash;Gilbert and Wibbald know in what state they found  me&mdash;quite and clean exhausted.&rdquo;          &ldquo;We can bear witness,&rdquo; said Gilbert; &ldquo;for when we had cleared  away the ruin, and by Saint Dunstan&rsquo;s help lighted upon the dungeon  stair, we found the runlet of sack half empty, the Jew half dead, and the Friar  more than half&mdash;exhausted, as he calls it.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ye be knaves! ye lie!&rdquo; retorted the offended Friar; &ldquo;it was  you and your gormandizing companions that drank up the sack, and called it your  morning draught&mdash;I am a pagan, an I kept it not for the Captain&rsquo;s  own throat. But what recks it? The Jew is converted, and understands all I have  told him, very nearly, if not altogether, as well as myself.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Jew,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;is this true? hast thou renounced  thine unbelief?&rdquo;          &ldquo;May I so find mercy in your eyes,&rdquo; said the Jew, &ldquo;as I know  not one word which the reverend prelate spake to me all this fearful night.  Alas! I was so distraught with agony, and fear, and grief, that had our holy  father Abraham come to preach to me, he had found but a deaf listener.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou liest, Jew, and thou knowest thou dost.&rdquo; said the Friar;  &ldquo;I will remind thee of but one word of our conference&mdash;thou didst  promise to give all thy substance to our holy Order.&rdquo;          &ldquo;So help me the Promise, fair sirs,&rdquo; said Isaac, even more alarmed  than before, &ldquo;as no such sounds ever crossed my lips! Alas! I am an aged  beggar&rsquo;d man&mdash;I fear me a childless&mdash;have ruth on me, and let  me go!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the Friar, &ldquo;if thou dost retract vows made in  favour of holy Church, thou must do penance.&rdquo;          Accordingly, he raised his halberd, and would have laid the staff of it lustily  on the Jew&rsquo;s shoulders, had not the Black Knight stopped the blow, and  thereby transferred the Holy Clerk&rsquo;s resentment to himself.          &ldquo;By Saint Thomas of Kent,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;an I buckle to my gear,  I will teach thee, sir lazy lover, to mell with thine own matters, maugre thine  iron case there!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay, be not wroth with me,&rdquo; said the Knight; &ldquo;thou knowest I  am thy sworn friend and comrade.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I know no such thing,&rdquo; answered the Friar; &ldquo;and defy thee  for a meddling coxcomb!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay, but,&rdquo; said the Knight, who seemed to take a pleasure in  provoking his quondam host, &ldquo;hast thou forgotten how, that for my sake  (for I say nothing of the temptation of the flagon and the pasty) thou didst  break thy vow of fast and vigil?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Truly, friend,&rdquo; said the Friar, clenching his huge fist, &ldquo;I  will bestow a buffet on thee.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I accept of no such presents,&rdquo; said the Knight; &ldquo;I am  content to take thy cuff   421   as a loan, but I will repay thee  with usury as deep as ever thy prisoner there exacted in his traffic.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I will prove that presently,&rdquo; said the Friar.          &ldquo;Hola!&rdquo; cried the Captain, &ldquo;what art thou after, mad Friar?  brawling beneath our Trysting-tree?&rdquo;          &ldquo;No brawling,&rdquo; said the Knight, &ldquo;it is but a friendly  interchange of courtesy.&mdash;Friar, strike an thou darest&mdash;I will stand  thy blow, if thou wilt stand mine.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou hast the advantage with that iron pot on thy head,&rdquo; said the  churchman; &ldquo;but have at thee&mdash;Down thou goest, an thou wert Goliath  of Gath in his brazen helmet.&rdquo;          The Friar bared his brawny arm up to the elbow, and putting his full strength  to the blow, gave the Knight a buffet that might have felled an ox. But his  adversary stood firm as a rock. A loud shout was uttered by all the yeomen  around; for the Clerk&rsquo;s cuff was proverbial amongst them, and there were  few who, in jest or earnest, had not had the occasion to know its vigour.          &ldquo;Now, Priest,&rdquo; said, the Knight, pulling off his gauntlet,  &ldquo;if I had vantage on my head, I will have none on my hand&mdash;stand  fast as a true man.&rdquo;          &ldquo;&lsquo;Genam meam dedi vapulatori&rsquo;&mdash;I have given my cheek to  the smiter,&rdquo; said the Priest; &ldquo;an thou canst stir me from the spot,  fellow, I will freely bestow on thee the Jew&rsquo;s ransom.&rdquo;          So spoke the burly Priest, assuming, on his part, high defiance. But who may  resist his fate? The buffet of the Knight was given with such strength and  good-will, that the Friar rolled head over heels upon the plain, to the great  amazement of all the spectators. But he arose neither angry nor crestfallen.          &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said he to the Knight, &ldquo;thou shouldst have used  thy strength with more discretion. I had mumbled but a lame mass an thou hadst  broken my jaw, for the piper plays ill that wants the nether chops.  Nevertheless, there is my hand, in friendly witness, that I will exchange no  more cuffs with thee, having been a loser by the barter. End now all  unkindness. Let us put the Jew to ransom, since the leopard will not change his  spots, and a Jew he will continue to be.&rdquo;          &ldquo;The Priest,&rdquo; said Clement, &ldquo;is not half so confident of the  Jew&rsquo;s conversion, since he received that buffet on the ear.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Go to, knave, what pratest thou of conversions?&mdash;what, is there no  respect?&mdash;all masters and no men?&mdash;I tell thee, fellow, I was  somewhat totty when I received the good knight&rsquo;s blow, or I had kept my  ground under it. But an thou gibest more of it, thou shalt learn I can give as  well as take.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Peace all!&rdquo; said the Captain. &ldquo;And thou, Jew, think of thy  ransom; thou needest not to be told that thy race are held to be accursed in  all Christian communities, and trust me that we cannot endure thy presence  among us. Think, therefore, of an offer, while I examine a prisoner of another  cast.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Were many of Front-de-Bœuf&rsquo;s men taken?&rdquo; demanded the Black  Knight.          &ldquo;None of note enough to be put to ransom,&rdquo; answered the Captain;  &ldquo;a set of hilding fellows there were, whom we dismissed to find them a  new master&mdash;enough had been done for revenge and profit; the bunch of them  were not worth a cardecu. The prisoner I speak of is better booty&mdash;a jolly  monk riding to visit his leman, an I may judge by his horse-gear and wearing  apparel.&mdash;Here cometh the worthy prelate, as pert as a pyet.&rdquo; And,  between two yeomen, was brought before the silvan throne of the outlaw Chief,  our old friend, Prior Aymer of Jorvaulx.                     CHAPTER XXXIII        &mdash;-Flower of warriors,   How is&rsquo;t with Titus Lartius?   MARCIUS.&mdash;As with a man busied about decrees,   Condemning some to death and some to exile,   Ransoming him or pitying, threatening the other.          C ORIOLANUS           The captive Abbot&rsquo;s features and manners exhibited a whimsical mixture of  offended pride, and deranged foppery and bodily terror.          &ldquo;Why, how now, my masters?&rdquo; said he, with a voice in which all  three emotions were blended. &ldquo;What order is this among ye? Be ye Turks or  Christians, that handle a churchman?&mdash;Know ye what it is, &lsquo;manus  imponere in servos Domini&rsquo;? Ye have plundered my mails&mdash;torn my cope  of curious cut lace, which might have served a cardinal!&mdash;Another in my  place would have been at his &lsquo;excommunicabo vos&rsquo;; but I am  placible, and if ye order forth my palfreys, release my brethren, and restore  my mails, tell down with all speed an hundred crowns to be expended in masses  at the high altar of Jorvaulx Abbey, and make your vow to eat no venison until  next Pentecost, it may be you shall hear little more of this mad frolic.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Holy Father,&rdquo; said the chief Outlaw, &ldquo;it grieves me to think  that you have met with such usage from any of my followers, as calls for your  fatherly reprehension.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Usage!&rdquo; echoed the priest, encouraged by the mild tone of the  silvan leader; &ldquo;it were usage fit for no hound of good race&mdash;much  less for a Christian&mdash;far less for a priest&mdash;and least of all for the  Prior of the holy community of Jorvaulx. Here is a profane and drunken  minstrel, called Allan-a-Dale&mdash;&lsquo;nebulo quidam&rsquo;&mdash;who has  menaced me with corporal punishment&mdash;nay, with death itself, an I pay not  down four hundred crowns of ransom, to the boot of all the treasure he hath  already robbed me of&mdash;gold chains and gymmal rings to an unknown value;  besides what is broken and spoiled among their rude hands, such as my  pouncer-box and silver crisping-tongs.&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is impossible that Allan-a-Dale can have thus treated a man of your  reverend bearing,&rdquo; replied the Captain.          &ldquo;It is true as the gospel of Saint Nicodemus,&rdquo; said the Prior;  &ldquo;he swore, with many a cruel north-country oath, that he would hang me up  on the highest tree in the greenwood.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Did he so in very deed? Nay, then, reverend father, I think you had  better comply with his demands&mdash;for Allan-a-Dale is the very man to abide  by his word when he has so pledged it.&rdquo;   43            &ldquo;You do but jest with me,&rdquo; said the astounded Prior, with a forced  laugh; &ldquo;and I love a good jest with all my heart. But, ha! ha! ha! when  the mirth has lasted the livelong night, it is time to be grave in the  morning.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And I am as grave as a father confessor,&rdquo; replied the Outlaw;  &ldquo;you must pay a round ransom, Sir Prior, or your convent is likely to be  called to a new election; for your place will know you no more.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Are ye Christians,&rdquo; said the Prior, &ldquo;and hold this language  to a churchman?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Christians! ay, marry are we, and have divinity among us to boot,&rdquo;  answered the Outlaw. &ldquo;Let our buxom chaplain stand forth, and expound to  this reverend father the texts which concern this matter.&rdquo;          The Friar, half-drunk, half-sober, had huddled a friar&rsquo;s frock over his  green cassock, and now summoning together whatever scraps of learning he had  acquired by rote in former days, &ldquo;Holy father,&rdquo; said he,  &ldquo;&lsquo;Deus faciat salvam benignitatem vestram&rsquo;&mdash;You are  welcome to the greenwood.&rdquo;          &ldquo;What profane mummery is this?&rdquo; said the Prior. &ldquo;Friend, if  thou be&rsquo;st indeed of the church, it were a better deed to show me how I  may escape from these men&rsquo;s hands, than to stand ducking and grinning  here like a morris-dancer.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Truly, reverend father,&rdquo; said the Friar, &ldquo;I know but one  mode in which thou mayst escape. This is Saint Andrew&rsquo;s day with us, we  are taking our tithes.&rdquo;          &ldquo;But not of the church, then, I trust, my good brother?&rdquo; said the  Prior.          &ldquo;Of church and lay,&rdquo; said the Friar; &ldquo;and therefore, Sir  Prior &lsquo;facite vobis amicos de Mammone iniquitatis&rsquo;&mdash;make  yourselves friends of the Mammon of unrighteousness, for no other friendship is  like to serve your turn.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I love a jolly woodsman at heart,&rdquo; said the Prior, softening his  tone; &ldquo;come, ye must not deal too hard with me&mdash;I can well of  woodcraft, and can wind a horn clear and lustily, and hollo till every oak  rings again&mdash;Come, ye must not deal too hard with me.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Give him a horn,&rdquo; said the Outlaw; &ldquo;we will prove the skill  he boasts of.&rdquo;          The Prior Aymer winded a blast accordingly. The Captain shook his head.          &ldquo;Sir Prior,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;thou blowest a merry note, but it may  not ransom thee&mdash;we cannot afford, as the legend on a good knight&rsquo;s  shield hath it, to set thee free for a blast. Moreover, I have found  thee&mdash;thou art one of those, who, with new French graces and Tra-li-ras,  disturb the ancient English bugle notes.&mdash;Prior, that last flourish on the  recheat hath added fifty crowns to thy ransom, for corrupting the true old  manly blasts of venerie.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Well, friend,&rdquo; said the Abbot, peevishly, &ldquo;thou art ill to  please with thy woodcraft. I pray thee be more conformable in this matter of my  ransom. At a word&mdash;since I must needs, for once, hold a candle to the  devil&mdash;what ransom am I to pay for walking on Watling-street, without  having fifty men at my back?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Were it not well,&rdquo; said the Lieutenant of the gang apart to the  Captain, &ldquo;that the Prior should name the Jew&rsquo;s ransom, and the Jew  name the Prior&rsquo;s?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou art a mad knave,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;but thy plan  transcends!&mdash;Here, Jew, step forth&mdash;Look at that holy Father Aymer,  Prior of the rich Abbey of Jorvaulx, and tell us at what ransom we should hold  him?&mdash;Thou knowest the income of his convent, I warrant thee.&rdquo;          &ldquo;O, assuredly,&rdquo; said Isaac. &ldquo;I have trafficked with the good  fathers, and bought wheat and barley, and fruits of the earth, and also much  wool. O, it is a rich abbey-stede, and they do live upon the fat, and drink the  sweet wines upon the lees, these good fathers of Jorvaulx. Ah, if an outcast  like me had such a home to go to, and such incomings by the year and by the  month, I would pay much gold and silver to redeem my captivity.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Hound of a Jew!&rdquo; exclaimed the Prior, &ldquo;no one knows better  than thy own cursed self, that our holy house of God is indebted for the  finishing of our chancel&mdash;&rdquo;          &ldquo;And for the storing of your cellars in the last season with the due  allowance of Gascon wine,&rdquo; interrupted the Jew; &ldquo;but  that&mdash;that is small matters.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Hear the infidel dog!&rdquo; said the churchman; &ldquo;he jangles as if  our holy community did come under debts for the wines we have a license to  drink, &lsquo;propter necessitatem, et ad frigus depellendum&rsquo;. The  circumcised villain blasphemeth the holy church, and Christian men listen and  rebuke him not!&rdquo;          &ldquo;All this helps nothing,&rdquo; said the leader.&mdash;&ldquo;Isaac,  pronounce what he may pay, without flaying both hide and hair.&rdquo;          &ldquo;An six hundred crowns,&rdquo; said Isaac, &ldquo;the good Prior might  well pay to your honoured valours, and never sit less soft in his stall.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Six hundred crowns,&rdquo; said the leader, gravely; &ldquo;I am  contented&mdash;thou hast well spoken, Isaac&mdash;six hundred crowns.&mdash;It  is a sentence, Sir Prior.&rdquo;          &ldquo;A sentence!&mdash;a sentence!&rdquo; exclaimed the band; &ldquo;Solomon  had not done it better.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou hearest thy doom, Prior,&rdquo; said the leader.          &ldquo;Ye are mad, my masters,&rdquo; said the Prior; &ldquo;where am I to find  such a sum? If I sell the very pyx and candlesticks on the altar at Jorvaulx, I  shall scarce raise the half; and it will be necessary for that purpose that I  go to Jorvaulx myself; ye may retain as borrows   44   my two  priests.&rdquo;          &ldquo;That will be but blind trust,&rdquo; said the Outlaw; &ldquo;we will  retain thee, Prior, and send them to fetch thy ransom. Thou shalt not want a  cup of wine and a collop of venison the while; and if thou lovest woodcraft,  thou shalt see such as your north country never witnessed.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Or, if so please you,&rdquo; said Isaac, willing to curry favour with  the outlaws, &ldquo;I can send to York for the six hundred crowns, out of  certain monies in my hands, if so be that the most reverend Prior present will  grant me a quittance.&rdquo;          &ldquo;He shall grant thee whatever thou dost list, Isaac,&rdquo; said the  Captain; &ldquo;and thou shalt lay down the redemption money for Prior Aymer as  well as for thyself.&rdquo;          &ldquo;For myself! ah, courageous sirs,&rdquo; said the Jew, &ldquo;I am a  broken and impoverished man; a beggar&rsquo;s staff must be my portion through  life, supposing I were to pay you fifty crowns.&rdquo;          &ldquo;The Prior shall judge of that matter,&rdquo; replied the  Captain.&mdash;&ldquo;How say you, Father Aymer? Can the Jew afford a good  ransom?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Can he afford a ransom?&rdquo; answered the Prior &ldquo;Is he not Isaac  of York, rich enough to redeem the captivity of the ten tribes of Israel, who  were led into Assyrian bondage?&mdash;I have seen but little of him myself, but  our cellarer and treasurer have dealt largely with him, and report says that  his house at York is so full of gold and silver as is a shame in any Christian  land. Marvel it is to all living Christian hearts that such gnawing adders  should be suffered to eat into the bowels of the state, and even of the holy  church herself, with foul usuries and extortions.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Hold, father,&rdquo; said the Jew, &ldquo;mitigate and assuage your  choler. I pray of your reverence to remember that I force my monies upon no  one. But when churchman and layman, prince and prior, knight and priest, come  knocking to Isaac&rsquo;s door, they borrow not his shekels with these uncivil  terms. It is then, Friend Isaac, will you pleasure us in this matter, and our  day shall be truly kept, so God sa&rsquo; me?&mdash;and Kind Isaac, if ever you  served man, show yourself a friend in this need! And when the day comes, and I  ask my own, then what hear I but Damned Jew, and The curse of Egypt on your  tribe, and all that may stir up the rude and uncivil populace against poor  strangers!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Prior,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;Jew though he be, he hath in this  spoken well. Do thou, therefore, name his ransom, as he named thine, without  farther rude terms.&rdquo;          &ldquo;None but &lsquo;latro famosus&rsquo;&mdash;the interpretation  whereof,&rdquo; said the Prior, &ldquo;will I give at some other time and  tide&mdash;would place a Christian prelate and an unbaptized Jew upon the same  bench. But since ye require me to put a price upon this caitiff, I tell you  openly that ye will wrong yourselves if you take from him a penny under a  thousand crowns.&rdquo;          &ldquo;A sentence!&mdash;a sentence!&rdquo; exclaimed the chief Outlaw.          &ldquo;A sentence!&mdash;a sentence!&rdquo; shouted his assessors; &ldquo;the  Christian has shown his good nurture, and dealt with us more generously than  the Jew.&rdquo;          &ldquo;The God of my fathers help me!&rdquo; said the Jew; &ldquo;will ye bear  to the ground an impoverished creature?&mdash;I am this day childless, and will  ye deprive me of the means of livelihood?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou wilt have the less to provide for, Jew, if thou art  childless,&rdquo; said Aymer.          &ldquo;Alas! my lord,&rdquo; said Isaac, &ldquo;your law permits you not to  know how the child of our bosom is entwined with the strings of our  heart&mdash;O Rebecca! laughter of my beloved Rachel! were each leaf on that  tree a zecchin, and each zecchin mine own, all that mass of wealth would I give  to know whether thou art alive, and escaped the hands of the Nazarene!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Was not thy daughter dark-haired?&rdquo; said one of the outlaws;  &ldquo;and wore she not a veil of twisted sendal, broidered with silver?&rdquo;          &ldquo;She did!&mdash;she did!&rdquo; said the old man, trembling with  eagerness, as formerly with fear. &ldquo;The blessing of Jacob be upon thee!  canst thou tell me aught of her safety?&rdquo;          &ldquo;It was she, then,&rdquo; said the yeoman, &ldquo;who was carried off by  the proud Templar, when he broke through our ranks on yester-even. I had drawn  my bow to send a shaft after him, but spared him even for the sake of the  damsel, who I feared might take harm from the arrow.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; answered the Jew, &ldquo;I would to God thou hadst shot,  though the arrow had pierced her bosom!&mdash;Better the tomb of her fathers  than the dishonourable couch of the licentious and savage Templar. Ichabod!  Ichabod! the glory hath departed from my house!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; said the Chief, looking round, &ldquo;the old man is but  a Jew, natheless his grief touches me.&mdash;Deal uprightly with us,  Isaac&mdash;will paying this ransom of a thousand crowns leave thee altogether  penniless?&rdquo;          Isaac, recalled to think of his worldly goods, the love of which, by dint of  inveterate habit, contended even with his parental affection, grew pale,  stammered, and could not deny there might be some small surplus.          &ldquo;Well&mdash;go to&mdash;what though there be,&rdquo; said the Outlaw,  &ldquo;we will not reckon with thee too closely. Without treasure thou mayst as  well hope to redeem thy child from the clutches of Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert,  as to shoot a stag-royal with a headless shaft.&mdash;We will take thee at the  same ransom with Prior Aymer, or rather at one hundred crowns lower, which  hundred crowns shall be mine own peculiar loss, and not light upon this  worshipful community; and so we shall avoid the heinous offence of rating a Jew  merchant as high as a Christian prelate, and thou wilt have six hundred crowns  remaining to treat for thy daughter&rsquo;s ransom. Templars love the glitter  of silver shekels as well as the sparkle of black eyes.&mdash;Hasten to make  thy crowns chink in the ear of De Bois-Guilbert, ere worse comes of it. Thou  wilt find him, as our scouts have brought notice, at the next Preceptory house  of his Order.&mdash;Said I well, my merry mates?&rdquo;          The yeomen expressed their wonted acquiescence in their leader&rsquo;s opinion;  and Isaac, relieved of one half of his apprehensions, by learning that his  daughter lived, and might possibly be ransomed, threw himself at the feet of  the generous Outlaw, and, rubbing his beard against his buskins, sought to kiss  the hem of his green cassock. The Captain drew himself back, and extricated  himself from the Jew&rsquo;s grasp, not without some marks of contempt.          &ldquo;Nay, beshrew thee, man, up with thee! I am English born, and love no  such Eastern prostrations&mdash;Kneel to God, and not to a poor sinner, like  me.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay, Jew,&rdquo; said Prior Aymer; &ldquo;kneel to God, as represented in  the servant of his altar, and who knows, with thy sincere repentance and due  gifts to the shrine of Saint Robert, what grace thou mayst acquire for thyself  and thy daughter Rebecca? I grieve for the maiden, for she is of fair and  comely countenance,&mdash;I beheld her in the lists of Ashby. Also Brian de  Bois-Guilbert is one with whom I may do much&mdash;bethink thee how thou mayst  deserve my good word with him.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Alas! alas!&rdquo; said the Jew, &ldquo;on every hand the spoilers arise  against me&mdash;I am given as a prey unto the Assyrian, and a prey unto him of  Egypt.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And what else should be the lot of thy accursed race?&rdquo; answered  the Prior; &ldquo;for what saith holy writ, &lsquo;verbum Domini projecerunt,  et sapientia est nulla in eis&rsquo;&mdash;they have cast forth the word of the  Lord, and there is no wisdom in them; &lsquo;propterea dabo mulieres eorum  exteris&rsquo;&mdash;I will give their women to strangers, that is to the  Templar, as in the present matter; &lsquo;et thesauros eorum haeredibus  alienis&rsquo;, and their treasures to others&mdash;as in the present case to  these honest gentlemen.&rdquo;          Isaac groaned deeply, and began to wring his hands, and to relapse into his  state of desolation and despair. But the leader of the yeomen led him aside.          &ldquo;Advise thee well, Isaac,&rdquo; said Locksley, &ldquo;what thou wilt do  in this matter; my counsel to thee is to make a friend of this churchman. He is  vain, Isaac, and he is covetous; at least he needs money to supply his  profusion. Thou canst easily gratify his greed; for think not that I am blinded  by thy pretexts of poverty. I am intimately acquainted, Isaac, with the very  iron chest in which thou dost keep thy money-bags&mdash;What! know I not the  great stone beneath the apple-tree, that leads into the vaulted chamber under  thy garden at York?&rdquo; The Jew grew as pale as death&mdash;&ldquo;But fear  nothing from me,&rdquo; continued the yeoman, &ldquo;for we are of old  acquainted. Dost thou not remember the sick yeoman whom thy fair daughter  Rebecca redeemed from the gyves at York, and kept him in thy house till his  health was restored, when thou didst dismiss him recovered, and with a piece of  money?&mdash;Usurer as thou art, thou didst never place coin at better interest  than that poor silver mark, for it has this day saved thee five hundred  crowns.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And thou art he whom we called Diccon Bend-the-Bow?&rdquo; said Isaac;  &ldquo;I thought ever I knew the accent of thy voice.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I am Bend-the-Bow,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;and Locksley, and  have a good name besides all these.&rdquo;          &ldquo;But thou art mistaken, good Bend-the-Bow, concerning that same vaulted  apartment. So help me Heaven, as there is nought in it but some merchandises  which I will gladly part with to you&mdash;one hundred yards of Lincoln green  to make doublets to thy men, and a hundred staves of Spanish yew to make bows,  and a hundred silken bowstrings, tough, round, and sound&mdash;these will I  send thee for thy good-will, honest Diccon, an thou wilt keep silence about the  vault, my good Diccon.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Silent as a dormouse,&rdquo; said the Outlaw; &ldquo;and never trust me  but I am grieved for thy daughter. But I may not help it&mdash;The Templars  lances are too strong for my archery in the open field&mdash;they would scatter  us like dust. Had I but known it was Rebecca when she was borne off, something  might have been done; but now thou must needs proceed by policy. Come, shall I  treat for thee with the Prior?&rdquo;          &ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name, Diccon, an thou canst, aid me to recover the child  of my bosom!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Do not thou interrupt me with thine ill-timed avarice,&rdquo; said the  Outlaw, &ldquo;and I will deal with him in thy behalf.&rdquo;          He then turned from the Jew, who followed him, however, as closely as his  shadow.          &ldquo;Prior Aymer,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;come apart with me under  this tree. Men say thou dost love wine, and a lady&rsquo;s smile, better than  beseems thy Order, Sir Priest; but with that I have nought to do. I have heard,  too, thou dost love a brace of good dogs and a fleet horse, and it may well be  that, loving things which are costly to come by, thou hatest not a purse of  gold. But I have never heard that thou didst love oppression or  cruelty.&mdash;Now, here is Isaac willing to give thee the means of pleasure  and pastime in a bag containing one hundred marks of silver, if thy  intercession with thine ally the Templar shall avail to procure the freedom of  his daughter.&rdquo;          &ldquo;In safety and honour, as when taken from me,&rdquo; said the Jew,  &ldquo;otherwise it is no bargain.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Peace, Isaac,&rdquo; said the Outlaw, &ldquo;or I give up thine  interest.&mdash;What say you to this my purpose, Prior Aymer?&rdquo;          &ldquo;The matter,&rdquo; quoth the Prior, &ldquo;is of a mixed condition; for,  if I do a good deal on the one hand, yet, on the other, it goeth to the vantage  of a Jew, and in so much is against my conscience. Yet, if the Israelite will  advantage the Church by giving me somewhat over to the building of our dortour,    45   I will take it on my conscience to  aid him in the matter of his daughter.&rdquo;          &ldquo;For a score of marks to the dortour,&rdquo; said the  Outlaw,&mdash;&ldquo;Be still, I say, Isaac!&mdash;or for a brace of silver  candlesticks to the altar, we will not stand with you.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay, but, good Diccon Bend-the-Bow&rdquo;&mdash;said Isaac, endeavouring  to interpose.          &ldquo;Good Jew&mdash;good beast&mdash;good earthworm!&rdquo; said the yeoman,  losing patience; &ldquo;an thou dost go on to put thy filthy lucre in the  balance with thy daughter&rsquo;s life and honour, by Heaven, I will strip thee  of every maravedi thou hast in the world, before three days are out!&rdquo;          Isaac shrunk together, and was silent.          &ldquo;And what pledge am I to have for all this?&rdquo; said the Prior.          &ldquo;When Isaac returns successful through your mediation,&rdquo; said the  Outlaw, &ldquo;I swear by Saint Hubert, I will see that he pays thee the money  in good silver, or I will reckon with him for it in such sort, he had better  have paid twenty such sums.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Well then, Jew,&rdquo; said Aymer, &ldquo;since I must needs meddle in  this matter, let me have the use of thy writing-tablets&mdash;though,  hold&mdash;rather than use thy pen, I would fast for twenty-four hours, and  where shall I find one?&rdquo;          &ldquo;If your holy scruples can dispense with using the Jew&rsquo;s tablets,  for the pen I can find a remedy,&rdquo; said the yeoman; and, bending his bow,  he aimed his shaft at a wild-goose which was soaring over their heads, the  advanced-guard of a phalanx of his tribe, which were winging their way to the  distant and solitary fens of Holderness. The bird came fluttering down,  transfixed with the arrow.          &ldquo;There, Prior,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;are quills enow to supply  all the monks of Jorvaulx for the next hundred years, an they take not to  writing chronicles.&rdquo;          The Prior sat down, and at great leisure indited an epistle to Brian de  Bois-Guilbert, and having carefully sealed up the tablets, delivered them to  the Jew, saying, &ldquo;This will be thy safe-conduct to the Preceptory of  Templestowe, and, as I think, is most likely to accomplish the delivery of thy  daughter, if it be well backed with proffers of advantage and commodity at  thine own hand; for, trust me well, the good Knight Bois-Guilbert is of their  confraternity that do nought for nought.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Well, Prior,&rdquo; said the Outlaw, &ldquo;I will detain thee no longer  here than to give the Jew a quittance for the six hundred crowns at which thy  ransom is fixed&mdash;I accept of him for my pay-master; and if I hear that ye  boggle at allowing him in his accompts the sum so paid by him, Saint Mary  refuse me, an I burn not the abbey over thine head, though I hang ten years the  sooner!&rdquo;          With a much worse grace than that wherewith he had penned the letter to  Bois-Guilbert, the Prior wrote an acquittance, discharging Isaac of York of six  hundred crowns, advanced to him in his need for acquittal of his ransom, and  faithfully promising to hold true compt with him for that sum.          &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Prior Aymer, &ldquo;I will pray you of restitution  of my mules and palfreys, and the freedom of the reverend brethren attending  upon me, and also of the gymmal rings, jewels, and fair vestures, of which I  have been despoiled, having now satisfied you for my ransom as a true  prisoner.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Touching your brethren, Sir Prior,&rdquo; said Locksley, &ldquo;they  shall have present freedom, it were unjust to detain them; touching your horses  and mules, they shall also be restored, with such spending-money as may enable  you to reach York, for it were cruel to deprive you of the means of  journeying.&mdash;But as concerning rings, jewels, chains, and what else, you  must understand that we are men of tender consciences, and will not yield to a  venerable man like yourself, who should be dead to the vanities of this life,  the strong temptation to break the rule of his foundation, by wearing rings,  chains, or other vain gauds.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Think what you do, my masters,&rdquo; said the Prior, &ldquo;ere you put  your hand on the Church&rsquo;s patrimony&mdash;These things are &lsquo;inter  res sacras&rsquo;, and I wot not what judgment might ensue were they to be  handled by laical hands.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I will take care of that, reverend Prior,&rdquo; said the Hermit of  Copmanhurst; &ldquo;for I will wear them myself.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Friend, or brother,&rdquo; said the Prior, in answer to this solution of  his doubts, &ldquo;if thou hast really taken religious orders, I pray thee to  look how thou wilt answer to thine official for the share thou hast taken in  this day&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Friend Prior,&rdquo; returned the Hermit, &ldquo;you are to know that I  belong to a little diocese, where I am my own diocesan, and care as little for  the Bishop of York as I do for the Abbot of Jorvaulx, the Prior, and all the  convent.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou art utterly irregular,&rdquo; said the Prior; &ldquo;one of those  disorderly men, who, taking on them the sacred character without due cause,  profane the holy rites, and endanger the souls of those who take counsel at  their hands; &lsquo;lapides pro pane condonantes iis&rsquo;, giving them stones  instead of bread as the Vulgate hath it.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the Friar, &ldquo;an my brain-pan could have been  broken by Latin, it had not held so long together.&mdash;I say, that easing a  world of such misproud priests as thou art of their jewels and their gimcracks,  is a lawful spoiling of the Egyptians.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou be&rsquo;st a hedge-priest,&rdquo;   46   said the Prior,  in great wrath, &ldquo;&lsquo;excommunicabo vos&rsquo;.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou be&rsquo;st thyself more like a thief and a heretic,&rdquo; said  the Friar, equally indignant; &ldquo;I will pouch up no such affront before my  parishioners, as thou thinkest it not shame to put upon me, although I be a  reverend brother to thee. &lsquo;Ossa ejus perfringam&rsquo;, I will break your  bones, as the Vulgate hath it.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Hola!&rdquo; cried the Captain, &ldquo;come the reverend brethren to  such terms?&mdash;Keep thine assurance of peace, Friar.&mdash;Prior, an thou  hast not made thy peace perfect with God, provoke the Friar no  further.&mdash;Hermit, let the reverend father depart in peace, as a ransomed  man.&rdquo;          The yeomen separated the incensed priests, who continued to raise their voices,  vituperating each other in bad Latin, which the Prior delivered the more  fluently, and the Hermit with the greater vehemence. The Prior at length  recollected himself sufficiently to be aware that he was compromising his  dignity, by squabbling with such a hedge-priest as the Outlaw&rsquo;s chaplain,  and being joined by his attendants, rode off with considerably less pomp, and  in a much more apostolical condition, so far as worldly matters were concerned,  than he had exhibited before this rencounter.          It remained that the Jew should produce some security for the ransom which he  was to pay on the Prior&rsquo;s account, as well as upon his own. He gave,  accordingly, an order sealed with his signet, to a brother of his tribe at  York, requiring him to pay to the bearer the sum of a thousand crowns, and to  deliver certain merchandises specified in the note.          &ldquo;My brother Sheva,&rdquo; he said, groaning deeply, &ldquo;hath the key  of my warehouses.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And of the vaulted chamber,&rdquo; whispered Locksley.          &ldquo;No, no&mdash;may Heaven forefend!&rdquo; said Isaac; &ldquo;evil is the  hour that let any one whomsoever into that secret!&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is safe with me,&rdquo; said the Outlaw, &ldquo;so be that this thy  scroll produce the sum therein nominated and set down.&mdash;But what now,  Isaac? art dead? art stupefied? hath the payment of a thousand crowns put thy  daughter&rsquo;s peril out of thy mind?&rdquo;          The Jew started to his feet&mdash;&ldquo;No, Diccon, no&mdash;I will presently  set forth.&mdash;Farewell, thou whom I may not call good, and dare not and will  not call evil.&rdquo;          Yet ere Isaac departed, the Outlaw Chief bestowed on him this parting  advice:&mdash;&ldquo;Be liberal of thine offers, Isaac, and spare not thy purse  for thy daughter&rsquo;s safety. Credit me, that the gold thou shalt spare in  her cause, will hereafter give thee as much agony as if it were poured molten  down thy throat.&rdquo;          Isaac acquiesced with a deep groan, and set forth on his journey, accompanied  by two tall foresters, who were to be his guides, and at the same time his  guards, through the wood.          The Black Knight, who had seen with no small interest these various  proceedings, now took his leave of the Outlaw in turn; nor could he avoid  expressing his surprise at having witnessed so much of civil policy amongst  persons cast out from all the ordinary protection and influence of the laws.          &ldquo;Good fruit, Sir Knight,&rdquo; said the yeoman, &ldquo;will sometimes  grow on a sorry tree; and evil times are not always productive of evil alone  and unmixed. Amongst those who are drawn into this lawless state, there are,  doubtless, numbers who wish to exercise its license with some moderation, and  some who regret, it may be, that they are obliged to follow such a trade at  all.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And to one of those,&rdquo; said the Knight, &ldquo;I am now, I presume,  speaking?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Sir Knight,&rdquo; said the Outlaw, &ldquo;we have each our secret. You  are welcome to form your judgment of me, and I may use my conjectures touching  you, though neither of our shafts may hit the mark they are shot at. But as I  do not pray to be admitted into your mystery, be not offended that I preserve  my own.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I crave pardon, brave Outlaw,&rdquo; said the Knight, &ldquo;your  reproof is just. But it may be we shall meet hereafter with less of concealment  on either side.&mdash;Meanwhile we part friends, do we not?&rdquo;          &ldquo;There is my hand upon it,&rdquo; said Locksley; &ldquo;and I will call  it the hand of a true Englishman, though an outlaw for the present.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And there is mine in return,&rdquo; said the Knight, &ldquo;and I hold  it honoured by being clasped with yours. For he that does good, having the  unlimited power to do evil, deserves praise not only for the good which he  performs, but for the evil which he forbears. Fare thee well, gallant  Outlaw!&rdquo; Thus parted that fair fellowship; and He of the Fetterlock,  mounting upon his strong war-horse, rode off through the forest.                     CHAPTER XXXIV        KING JOHN.&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell thee what, my friend,   He is a very serpent in my way;   And wheresoe&rsquo;er this foot of mine doth tread,   He lies before me.&mdash;Dost thou understand me?          K ING  J OHN           There was brave feasting in the Castle of York, to which Prince John had  invited those nobles, prelates, and leaders, by whose assistance he hoped to  carry through his ambitious projects upon his brother&rsquo;s throne. Waldemar  Fitzurse, his able and politic agent, was at secret work among them, tempering  all to that pitch of courage which was necessary in making an open declaration  of their purpose. But their enterprise was delayed by the absence of more than  one main limb of the confederacy. The stubborn and daring, though brutal  courage of Front-de-Bœuf; the buoyant spirits and bold bearing of De Bracy;  the sagacity, martial experience, and renowned valour of Brian de  Bois-Guilbert, were important to the success of their conspiracy; and, while  cursing in secret their unnecessary and unmeaning absence, neither John nor his  adviser dared to proceed without them. Isaac the Jew also seemed to have  vanished, and with him the hope of certain sums of money, making up the subsidy  for which Prince John had contracted with that Israelite and his brethren. This  deficiency was likely to prove perilous in an emergency so critical.          It was on the morning after the fall of Torquilstone, that a confused report  began to spread abroad in the city of York, that De Bracy and Bois-Guilbert,  with their confederate Front-de-Bœuf, had been taken or slain. Waldemar  brought the rumour to Prince John, announcing, that he feared its truth the  more that they had set out with a small attendance, for the purpose of  committing an assault on the Saxon Cedric and his attendants. At another time  the Prince would have treated this deed of violence as a good jest; but now,  that it interfered with and impeded his own plans, he exclaimed against the  perpetrators, and spoke of the broken laws, and the infringement of public  order and of private property, in a tone which might have become King Alfred.          &ldquo;The unprincipled marauders,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;were I ever to  become monarch of England, I would hang such transgressors over the drawbridges  of their own castles.&rdquo;          &ldquo;But to become monarch of England,&rdquo; said his Ahithophel coolly,  &ldquo;it is necessary not only that your Grace should endure the  transgressions of these unprincipled marauders, but that you should afford them  your protection, notwithstanding your laudable zeal for the laws they are in  the habit of infringing. We shall be finely helped, if the churl Saxons should  have realized your Grace&rsquo;s vision, of converting feudal drawbridges into  gibbets; and yonder bold-spirited Cedric seemeth one to whom such an  imagination might occur. Your Grace is well aware, it will be dangerous to stir  without Front-de-Bœuf, De Bracy, and the Templar; and yet we have gone too far  to recede with safety.&rdquo;          Prince John struck his forehead with impatience, and then began to stride up  and down the apartment.          &ldquo;The villains,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the base treacherous villains, to  desert me at this pinch!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay, say rather the feather-pated giddy madmen,&rdquo; said Waldemar,  &ldquo;who must be toying with follies when such business was in hand.&rdquo;          &ldquo;What is to be done?&rdquo; said the Prince, stopping short before  Waldemar.          &ldquo;I know nothing which can be done,&rdquo; answered his counsellor,  &ldquo;save that which I have already taken order for.&mdash;I came not to  bewail this evil chance with your Grace, until I had done my best to remedy  it.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou art ever my better angel, Waldemar,&rdquo; said the Prince;  &ldquo;and when I have such a chancellor to advise withal, the reign of John  will be renowned in our annals.&mdash;What hast thou commanded?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I have ordered Louis Winkelbrand, De Bracy&rsquo;s lieutenant, to cause  his trumpet sound to horse, and to display his banner, and to set presently  forth towards the castle of Front-de-Bœuf, to do what yet may be done for the  succour of our friends.&rdquo;          Prince John&rsquo;s face flushed with the pride of a spoilt child, who has  undergone what it conceives to be an insult. &ldquo;By the face of God!&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;Waldemar Fitzurse, much hast thou taken upon thee! and over  malapert thou wert to cause trumpet to blow, or banner to be raised, in a town  where ourselves were in presence, without our express command.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I crave your Grace&rsquo;s pardon,&rdquo; said Fitzurse, internally  cursing the idle vanity of his patron; &ldquo;but when time pressed, and even  the loss of minutes might be fatal, I judged it best to take this much burden  upon me, in a matter of such importance to your Grace&rsquo;s interest.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou art pardoned, Fitzurse,&rdquo; said the prince, gravely; &ldquo;thy  purpose hath atoned for thy hasty rashness.&mdash;But whom have we  here?&mdash;De Bracy himself, by the rood!&mdash;and in strange guise doth he  come before us.&rdquo;          It was indeed De Bracy&mdash;&ldquo;bloody with spurring, fiery red with  speed.&rdquo; His armour bore all the marks of the late obstinate fray, being  broken, defaced, and stained with blood in many places, and covered with clay  and dust from the crest to the spur. Undoing his helmet, he placed it on the  table, and stood a moment as if to collect himself before he told his news.          &ldquo;De Bracy,&rdquo; said Prince John, &ldquo;what means this?&mdash;Speak,  I charge thee!&mdash;Are the Saxons in rebellion?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Speak, De Bracy,&rdquo; said Fitzurse, almost in the same moment with  his master, &ldquo;thou wert wont to be a man&mdash;Where is the  Templar?&mdash;where Front-de-Bœuf?&rdquo;          &ldquo;The Templar is fled,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;Front-de-Bœuf you  will never see more. He has found a red grave among the blazing rafters of his  own castle and I alone am escaped to tell you.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Cold news,&rdquo; said Waldemar, &ldquo;to us, though you speak of fire  and conflagration.&rdquo;          &ldquo;The worst news is not yet said,&rdquo; answered De Bracy; and, coming up  to Prince John, he uttered in a low and emphatic tone&mdash;&ldquo;Richard is  in England&mdash;I have seen and spoken with him.&rdquo;          Prince John turned pale, tottered, and caught at the back of an oaken bench to  support himself&mdash;much like to a man who receives an arrow in his bosom.          &ldquo;Thou ravest, De Bracy,&rdquo; said Fitzurse, &ldquo;it cannot be.&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is as true as truth itself,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;I was his  prisoner, and spoke with him.&rdquo;          &ldquo;With Richard Plantagenet, sayest thou?&rdquo; continued Fitzurse.          &ldquo;With Richard Plantagenet,&rdquo; replied De Bracy, &ldquo;with Richard  Cœur-de-Lion&mdash;with Richard of England.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And thou wert his prisoner?&rdquo; said Waldemar; &ldquo;he is then at  the head of a power?&rdquo;          &ldquo;No&mdash;only a few outlawed yeomen were around him, and to these his  person is unknown. I heard him say he was about to depart from them. He joined  them only to assist at the storming of Torquilstone.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Fitzurse, &ldquo;such is indeed the fashion of  Richard&mdash;a true knight-errant he, and will wander in wild adventure,  trusting the prowess of his single arm, like any Sir Guy or Sir Bevis, while  the weighty affairs of his kingdom slumber, and his own safety is  endangered.&mdash;What dost thou propose to do De Bracy?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I?&mdash;I offered Richard the service of my Free Lances, and he refused  them&mdash;I will lead them to Hull, seize on shipping, and embark for  Flanders; thanks to the bustling times, a man of action will always find  employment. And thou, Waldemar, wilt thou take lance and shield, and lay down  thy policies, and wend along with me, and share the fate which God sends  us?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I am too old, Maurice, and I have a daughter,&rdquo; answered Waldemar.          &ldquo;Give her to me, Fitzurse, and I will maintain her as fits her rank, with  the help of lance and stirrup,&rdquo; said De Bracy.          &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; answered Fitzurse; &ldquo;I will take sanctuary in this  church of Saint Peter&mdash;the Archbishop is my sworn brother.&rdquo;          During this discourse, Prince John had gradually awakened from the stupor into  which he had been thrown by the unexpected intelligence, and had been attentive  to the conversation which passed betwixt his followers. &ldquo;They fall off  from me,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;they hold no more by me than a  withered leaf by the bough when a breeze blows on it!&mdash;Hell and fiends!  can I shape no means for myself when I am deserted by these  cravens?&rdquo;&mdash;He paused, and there was an expression of diabolical  passion in the constrained laugh with which he at length broke in on their  conversation.          &ldquo;Ha, ha, ha! my good lords, by the light of Our Lady&rsquo;s brow, I held  ye sage men, bold men, ready-witted men; yet ye throw down wealth, honour,  pleasure, all that our noble game promised you, at the moment it might be won  by one bold cast!&rdquo;          &ldquo;I understand you not,&rdquo; said De Bracy. &ldquo;As soon as  Richard&rsquo;s return is blown abroad, he will be at the head of an army, and  all is then over with us. I would counsel you, my lord, either to fly to France  or take the protection of the Queen Mother.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I seek no safety for myself,&rdquo; said Prince John, haughtily;  &ldquo;that I could secure by a word spoken to my brother. But although you, De  Bracy, and you, Waldemar Fitzurse, are so ready to abandon me, I should not  greatly delight to see your heads blackening on Clifford&rsquo;s gate yonder.  Thinkest thou, Waldemar, that the wily Archbishop will not suffer thee to be  taken from the very horns of the altar, would it make his peace with King  Richard? And forgettest thou, De Bracy, that Robert Estoteville lies betwixt  thee and Hull with all his forces, and that the Earl of Essex is gathering his  followers? If we had reason to fear these levies even before Richard&rsquo;s  return, trowest thou there is any doubt now which party their leaders will  take? Trust me, Estoteville alone has strength enough to drive all thy Free  Lances into the Humber.&rdquo;&mdash;Waldemar Fitzurse and De Bracy looked in  each other&rsquo;s faces with blank dismay.&mdash;&ldquo;There is but one road  to safety,&rdquo; continued the Prince, and his brow grew black as midnight;  &ldquo;this object of our terror journeys alone&mdash;He must be met  withal.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Not by me,&rdquo; said De Bracy, hastily; &ldquo;I was his prisoner, and  he took me to mercy. I will not harm a feather in his crest.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Who spoke of harming him?&rdquo; said Prince John, with a hardened  laugh; &ldquo;the knave will say next that I meant he should slay  him!&mdash;No&mdash;a prison were better; and whether in Britain or Austria,  what matters it?&mdash;Things will be but as they were when we commenced our  enterprise&mdash;It was founded on the hope that Richard would remain a captive  in Germany&mdash;Our uncle Robert lived and died in the castle of  Cardiffe.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay, but,&rdquo; said Waldemar, &ldquo;your sire Henry sate more firm in  his seat than your Grace can. I say the best prison is that which is made by  the sexton&mdash;no dungeon like a church-vault! I have said my say.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Prison or tomb,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;I wash my hands of the  whole matter.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Villain!&rdquo; said Prince John, &ldquo;thou wouldst not bewray our  counsel?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Counsel was never bewrayed by me,&rdquo; said De Bracy, haughtily,  &ldquo;nor must the name of villain be coupled with mine!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Peace, Sir Knight!&rdquo; said Waldemar; &ldquo;and you, good my lord,  forgive the scruples of valiant De Bracy; I trust I shall soon remove  them.&rdquo;          &ldquo;That passes your eloquence, Fitzurse,&rdquo; replied the Knight.          &ldquo;Why, good Sir Maurice,&rdquo; rejoined the wily politician, &ldquo;start  not aside like a scared steed, without, at least, considering the object of  your terror.&mdash;This Richard&mdash;but a day since, and it would have been  thy dearest wish to have met him hand to hand in the ranks of battle&mdash;a  hundred times I have heard thee wish it.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;but that was as thou sayest, hand to  hand, and in the ranks of battle! Thou never heardest me breathe a thought of  assaulting him alone, and in a forest.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou art no good knight if thou dost scruple at it,&rdquo; said  Waldemar. &ldquo;Was it in battle that Lancelot de Lac and Sir Tristram won  renown? or was it not by encountering gigantic knights under the shade of deep  and unknown forests?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay, but I promise you,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;that neither  Tristram nor Lancelot would have been match, hand to hand, for Richard  Plantagenet, and I think it was not their wont to take odds against a single  man.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou art mad, De Bracy&mdash;what is it we propose to thee, a hired and  retained captain of Free Companions, whose swords are purchased for Prince  John&rsquo;s service? Thou art apprized of our enemy, and then thou scruplest,  though thy patron&rsquo;s fortunes, those of thy comrades, thine own, and the  life and honour of every one amongst us, be at stake!&rdquo;          &ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; said De Bracy, sullenly, &ldquo;that he gave me my  life. True, he sent me from his presence, and refused my homage&mdash;so far I  owe him neither favour nor allegiance&mdash;but I will not lift hand against  him.&rdquo;          &ldquo;It needs not&mdash;send Louis Winkelbrand and a score of thy  lances.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ye have sufficient ruffians of your own,&rdquo; said De Bracy;  &ldquo;not one of mine shall budge on such an errand.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Art thou so obstinate, De Bracy?&rdquo; said Prince John; &ldquo;and  wilt thou forsake me, after so many protestations of zeal for my  service?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I mean it not,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;I will abide by you in aught  that becomes a knight, whether in the lists or in the camp; but this highway  practice comes not within my vow.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Come hither, Waldemar,&rdquo; said Prince John. &ldquo;An unhappy prince  am I. My father, King Henry, had faithful servants&mdash;He had but to say that  he was plagued with a factious priest, and the blood of Thomas-a-Becket, saint  though he was, stained the steps of his own altar.&mdash;Tracy, Morville, Brito    47   loyal and daring subjects, your  names, your spirit, are extinct! and although Reginald Fitzurse hath left a  son, he hath fallen off from his father&rsquo;s fidelity and courage.&rdquo;          &ldquo;He has fallen off from neither,&rdquo; said Waldemar Fitzurse;  &ldquo;and since it may not better be, I will take on me the conduct of this  perilous enterprise. Dearly, however, did my father purchase the praise of a  zealous friend; and yet did his proof of loyalty to Henry fall far short of  what I am about to afford; for rather would I assail a whole calendar of  saints, than put spear in rest against Cœur-de-Lion.&mdash;De Bracy, to thee I  must trust to keep up the spirits of the doubtful, and to guard Prince  John&rsquo;s person. If you receive such news as I trust to send you, our  enterprise will no longer wear a doubtful aspect.&mdash;Page,&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;hie to my lodgings, and tell my armourer to be there in readiness; and  bid Stephen Wetheral, Broad Thoresby, and the Three Spears of Spyinghow, come  to me instantly; and let the scout-master, Hugh Bardon, attend me  also.&mdash;Adieu, my Prince, till better times.&rdquo; Thus speaking, he left  the apartment. &ldquo;He goes to make my brother prisoner,&rdquo; said Prince  John to De Bracy, &ldquo;with as little touch of compunction, as if it but  concerned the liberty of a Saxon franklin. I trust he will observe our orders,  and use our dear Richard&rsquo;s person with all due respect.&rdquo;          De Bracy only answered by a smile.          &ldquo;By the light of Our Lady&rsquo;s brow,&rdquo; said Prince John,  &ldquo;our orders to him were most precise&mdash;though it may be you heard  them not, as we stood together in the oriel window&mdash;Most clear and  positive was our charge that Richard&rsquo;s safety should be cared for, and  woe to Waldemar&rsquo;s head if he transgress it!&rdquo;          &ldquo;I had better pass to his lodgings,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;and make  him fully aware of your Grace&rsquo;s pleasure; for, as it quite escaped my  ear, it may not perchance have reached that of Waldemar.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; said Prince John, impatiently, &ldquo;I promise thee he  heard me; and, besides, I have farther occupation for thee. Maurice, come  hither; let me lean on thy shoulder.&rdquo;          They walked a turn through the hall in this familiar posture, and Prince John,  with an air of the most confidential intimacy, proceeded to say, &ldquo;What  thinkest thou of this Waldemar Fitzurse, my De Bracy?&mdash;He trusts to be our  Chancellor. Surely we will pause ere we give an office so high to one who shows  evidently how little he reverences our blood, by his so readily undertaking  this enterprise against Richard. Thou dost think, I warrant, that thou hast  lost somewhat of our regard, by thy boldly declining this unpleasing  task&mdash;But no, Maurice! I rather honour thee for thy virtuous constancy.  There are things most necessary to be done, the perpetrator of which we neither  love nor honour; and there may be refusals to serve us, which shall rather  exalt in our estimation those who deny our request. The arrest of my  unfortunate brother forms no such good title to the high office of Chancellor,  as thy chivalrous and courageous denial establishes in thee to the truncheon of  High Marshal. Think of this, De Bracy, and begone to thy charge.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Fickle tyrant!&rdquo; muttered De Bracy, as he left the presence of the  Prince; &ldquo;evil luck have they who trust thee. Thy Chancellor,  indeed!&mdash;He who hath the keeping of thy conscience shall have an easy  charge, I trow. But High Marshal of England! that,&rdquo; he said, extending  his arm, as if to grasp the baton of office, and assuming a loftier stride  along the antechamber, &ldquo;that is indeed a prize worth playing for!&rdquo;          De Bracy had no sooner left the apartment than Prince John summoned an  attendant.          &ldquo;Bid Hugh Bardon, our scout-master, come hither, as soon as he shall have  spoken with Waldemar Fitzurse.&rdquo;          The scout-master arrived after a brief delay, during which John traversed the  apartment with, unequal and disordered steps.          &ldquo;Bardon,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what did Waldemar desire of thee?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Two resolute men, well acquainted with these northern wilds, and skilful  in tracking the tread of man and horse.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And thou hast fitted him?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Let your grace never trust me else,&rdquo; answered the master of the  spies. &ldquo;One is from Hexamshire; he is wont to trace the Tynedale and  Teviotdale thieves, as a bloodhound follows the slot of a hurt deer. The other  is Yorkshire bred, and has twanged his bowstring right oft in merry Sherwood;  he knows each glade and dingle, copse and high-wood, betwixt this and  Richmond.&rdquo;          &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis well,&rdquo; said the Prince.&mdash;&ldquo;Goes Waldemar  forth with them?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Instantly,&rdquo; said Bardon.          &ldquo;With what attendance?&rdquo; asked John, carelessly.          &ldquo;Broad Thoresby goes with him, and Wetheral, whom they call, for his  cruelty, Stephen Steel-heart; and three northern men-at-arms that belonged to  Ralph Middleton&rsquo;s gang&mdash;they are called the Spears of  Spyinghow.&rdquo;          &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis well,&rdquo; said Prince John; then added, after a  moment&rsquo;s pause, &ldquo;Bardon, it imports our service that thou keep a  strict watch on Maurice De Bracy&mdash;so that he shall not observe it,  however&mdash;And let us know of his motions from time to time&mdash;with whom  he converses, what he proposeth. Fail not in this, as thou wilt be  answerable.&rdquo;          Hugh Bardon bowed, and retired.          &ldquo;If Maurice betrays me,&rdquo; said Prince John&mdash;&ldquo;if he  betrays me, as his bearing leads me to fear, I will have his head, were Richard  thundering at the gates of York.&rdquo;                     CHAPTER XXXV        Arouse the tiger of Hyrcanian deserts,   Strive with the half-starved lion for his prey;   Lesser the risk, than rouse the slumbering fire   Of wild Fanaticism.          A NONYMUS           Our tale now returns to Isaac of York.&mdash;Mounted upon a mule, the gift of  the Outlaw, with two tall yeomen to act as his guard and guides, the Jew had  set out for the Preceptory of Templestowe, for the purpose of negotiating his  daughter&rsquo;s redemption. The Preceptory was but a day&rsquo;s journey from  the demolished castle of Torquilstone, and the Jew had hoped to reach it before  nightfall; accordingly, having dismissed his guides at the verge of the forest,  and rewarded them with a piece of silver, he began to press on with such speed  as his weariness permitted him to exert. But his strength failed him totally  ere he had reached within four miles of the Temple-Court; racking pains shot  along his back and through his limbs, and the excessive anguish which he felt  at heart being now augmented by bodily suffering, he was rendered altogether  incapable of proceeding farther than a small market-town, were dwelt a Jewish  Rabbi of his tribe, eminent in the medical profession, and to whom Isaac was  well known. Nathan Ben Israel received his suffering countryman with that  kindness which the law prescribed, and which the Jews practised to each other.  He insisted on his betaking himself to repose, and used such remedies as were  then in most repute to check the progress of the fever, which terror, fatigue,  ill usage, and sorrow, had brought upon the poor old Jew.          On the morrow, when Isaac proposed to arise and pursue his journey, Nathan  remonstrated against his purpose, both as his host and as his physician. It  might cost him, he said, his life. But Isaac replied, that more than life and  death depended upon his going that morning to Templestowe.          &ldquo;To Templestowe!&rdquo; said his host with surprise again felt his pulse,  and then muttered to himself, &ldquo;His fever is abated, yet seems his mind  somewhat alienated and disturbed.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And why not to Templestowe?&rdquo; answered his patient. &ldquo;I grant  thee, Nathan, that it is a dwelling of those to whom the despised Children of  the Promise are a stumbling-block and an abomination; yet thou knowest that  pressing affairs of traffic sometimes carry us among these bloodthirsty  Nazarene soldiers, and that we visit the Preceptories of the Templars, as well  as the Commanderies of the Knights Hospitallers, as they are called.&rdquo;   48            &ldquo;I know it well,&rdquo; said Nathan; &ldquo;but wottest thou that Lucas  de Beaumanoir, the chief of their Order, and whom they term Grand Master, is  now himself at Templestowe?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I know it not,&rdquo; said Isaac; &ldquo;our last letters from our  brethren at Paris advised us that he was at that city, beseeching Philip for  aid against the Sultan Saladine.&rdquo;          &ldquo;He hath since come to England, unexpected by his brethren,&rdquo; said  Ben Israel; &ldquo;and he cometh among them with a strong and outstretched arm  to correct and to punish. His countenance is kindled in anger against those who  have departed from the vow which they have made, and great is the fear of those  sons of Belial. Thou must have heard of his name?&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is well known unto me,&rdquo; said Isaac; &ldquo;the Gentiles deliver  this Lucas Beaumanoir as a man zealous to slaying for every point of the  Nazarene law; and our brethren have termed him a fierce destroyer of the  Saracens, and a cruel tyrant to the Children of the Promise.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And truly have they termed him,&rdquo; said Nathan the physician.  &ldquo;Other Templars may be moved from the purpose of their heart by pleasure,  or bribed by promise of gold and silver; but Beaumanoir is of a different  stamp&mdash;hating sensuality, despising treasure, and pressing forward to that  which they call the crown of martyrdom&mdash;The God of Jacob speedily send it  unto him, and unto them all! Specially hath this proud man extended his glove  over the children of Judah, as holy David over Edom, holding the murder of a  Jew to be an offering of as sweet savour as the death of a Saracen. Impious and  false things has he said even of the virtues of our medicines, as if they were  the devices of Satan&mdash;The Lord rebuke him!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said Isaac, &ldquo;I must present myself at  Templestowe, though he hath made his face like unto a fiery furnace seven times  heated.&rdquo;          He then explained to Nathan the pressing cause of his journey. The Rabbi  listened with interest, and testified his sympathy after the fashion of his  people, rending his clothes, and saying, &ldquo;Ah, my daughter!&mdash;ah, my  daughter!&mdash;Alas! for the beauty of Zion!&mdash;Alas! for the captivity of  Israel!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou seest,&rdquo; said Isaac, &ldquo;how it stands with me, and that I  may not tarry. Peradventure, the presence of this Lucas Beaumanoir, being the  chief man over them, may turn Brian de Bois-Guilbert from the ill which he doth  meditate, and that he may deliver to me my beloved daughter Rebecca.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Go thou,&rdquo; said Nathan Ben Israel, &ldquo;and be wise, for wisdom  availed Daniel in the den of lions into which he was cast; and may it go well  with thee, even as thine heart wisheth. Yet, if thou canst, keep thee from the  presence of the Grand Master, for to do foul scorn to our people is his morning  and evening delight. It may be if thou couldst speak with Bois-Guilbert in  private, thou shalt the better prevail with him; for men say that these  accursed Nazarenes are not of one mind in the Preceptory&mdash;May their  counsels be confounded and brought to shame! But do thou, brother, return to me  as if it were to the house of thy father, and bring me word how it has sped  with thee; and well do I hope thou wilt bring with thee Rebecca, even the  scholar of the wise Miriam, whose cures the Gentiles slandered as if they had  been wrought by necromancy.&rdquo;          Isaac accordingly bade his friend farewell, and about an hour&rsquo;s riding  brought him before the Preceptory of Templestowe.          This establishment of the Templars was seated amidst fair meadows and pastures,  which the devotion of the former Preceptor had bestowed upon their Order. It  was strong and well fortified, a point never neglected by these knights, and  which the disordered state of England rendered peculiarly necessary. Two  halberdiers, clad in black, guarded the drawbridge, and others, in the same sad  livery, glided to and fro upon the walls with a funereal pace, resembling  spectres more than soldiers. The inferior officers of the Order were thus  dressed, ever since their use of white garments, similar to those of the  knights and esquires, had given rise to a combination of certain false brethren  in the mountains of Palestine, terming themselves Templars, and bringing great  dishonour on the Order. A knight was now and then seen to cross the court in  his long white cloak, his head depressed on his breast, and his arms folded.  They passed each other, if they chanced to meet, with a slow, solemn, and mute  greeting; for such was the rule of their Order, quoting thereupon the holy  texts, &ldquo;In many words thou shalt not avoid sin,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Life  and death are in the power of the tongue.&rdquo; In a word, the stern ascetic  rigour of the Temple discipline, which had been so long exchanged for prodigal  and licentious indulgence, seemed at once to have revived at Templestowe under  the severe eye of Lucas Beaumanoir.          Isaac paused at the gate, to consider how he might seek entrance in the manner  most likely to bespeak favour; for he was well aware, that to his unhappy race  the reviving fanaticism of the Order was not less dangerous than their  unprincipled licentiousness; and that his religion would be the object of hate  and persecution in the one case, as his wealth would have exposed him in the  other to the extortions of unrelenting oppression.          Meantime Lucas Beaumanoir walked in a small garden belonging to the Preceptory,  included within the precincts of its exterior fortification, and held sad and  confidential communication with a brother of his Order, who had come in his  company from Palestine.          The Grand Master was a man advanced in age, as was testified by his long grey  beard, and the shaggy grey eyebrows overhanging eyes, of which, however, years  had been unable to quench the fire. A formidable warrior, his thin and severe  features retained the soldier&rsquo;s fierceness of expression; an ascetic  bigot, they were no less marked by the emaciation of abstinence, and the  spiritual pride of the self-satisfied devotee. Yet with these severer traits of  physiognomy, there was mixed somewhat striking and noble, arising, doubtless,  from the great part which his high office called upon him to act among monarchs  and princes, and from the habitual exercise of supreme authority over the  valiant and high-born knights, who were united by the rules of the Order. His  stature was tall, and his gait, undepressed by age and toil, was erect and  stately. His white mantle was shaped with severe regularity, according to the  rule of Saint Bernard himself, being composed of what was then called Burrel  cloth, exactly fitted to the size of the wearer, and bearing on the left  shoulder the octangular cross peculiar to the Order, formed of red cloth. No  vair or ermine decked this garment; but in respect of his age, the Grand  Master, as permitted by the rules, wore his doublet lined and trimmed with the  softest lambskin, dressed with the wool outwards, which was the nearest  approach he could regularly make to the use of fur, then the greatest luxury of  dress. In his hand he bore that singular &ldquo;abacus&rdquo;, or staff of  office, with which Templars are usually represented, having at the upper end a  round plate, on which was engraved the cross of the Order, inscribed within a  circle or orle, as heralds term it. His companion, who attended on this great  personage, had nearly the same dress in all respects, but his extreme deference  towards his Superior showed that no other equality subsisted between them. The  Preceptor, for such he was in rank, walked not in a line with the Grand Master,  but just so far behind that Beaumanoir could speak to him without turning round  his head.          &ldquo;Conrade,&rdquo; said the Grand Master, &ldquo;dear companion of my  battles and my toils, to thy faithful bosom alone I can confide my sorrows. To  thee alone can I tell how oft, since I came to this kingdom, I have desired to  be dissolved and to be with the just. Not one object in England hath met mine  eye which it could rest upon with pleasure, save the tombs of our brethren,  beneath the massive roof of our Temple Church in yonder proud capital. O,  valiant Robert de Ros! did I exclaim internally, as I gazed upon these good  soldiers of the cross, where they lie sculptured on their sepulchres,&mdash;O,  worthy William de Mareschal! open your marble cells, and take to your repose a  weary brother, who would rather strive with a hundred thousand pagans than  witness the decay of our Holy Order!&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is but true,&rdquo; answered Conrade Mont-Fitchet; &ldquo;it is but  too true; and the irregularities of our brethren in England are even more gross  than those in France.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Because they are more wealthy,&rdquo; answered the Grand Master.  &ldquo;Bear with me, brother, although I should something vaunt myself. Thou  knowest the life I have led, keeping each point of my Order, striving with  devils embodied and disembodied, striking down the roaring lion, who goeth  about seeking whom he may devour, like a good knight and devout priest,  wheresoever I met with him&mdash;even as blessed Saint Bernard hath prescribed  to us in the forty-fifth capital of our rule, &lsquo;Ut Leo semper  feriatur&rsquo;.   49            &ldquo;But by the Holy Temple! the zeal which hath devoured my substance and my  life, yea, the very nerves and marrow of my bones; by that very Holy Temple I  swear to thee, that save thyself and some few that still retain the ancient  severity of our Order, I look upon no brethren whom I can bring my soul to  embrace under that holy name. What say our statutes, and how do our brethren  observe them? They should wear no vain or worldly ornament, no crest upon their  helmet, no gold upon stirrup or bridle-bit; yet who now go pranked out so  proudly and so gaily as the poor soldiers of the Temple? They are forbidden by  our statutes to take one bird by means of another, to shoot beasts with bow or  arblast, to halloo to a hunting-horn, or to spur the horse after game. But now,  at hunting and hawking, and each idle sport of wood and river, who so prompt as  the Templars in all these fond vanities? They are forbidden to read, save what  their Superior permitted, or listen to what is read, save such holy things as  may be recited aloud during the hours of refaction; but lo! their ears are at  the command of idle minstrels, and their eyes study empty romaunts. They were  commanded to extirpate magic and heresy. Lo! they are charged with studying the  accursed cabalistical secrets of the Jews, and the magic of the Paynim  Saracens. Simpleness of diet was prescribed to them, roots, pottage, gruels,  eating flesh but thrice a-week, because the accustomed feeding on flesh is a  dishonourable corruption of the body; and behold, their tables groan under  delicate fare! Their drink was to be water, and now, to drink like a Templar,  is the boast of each jolly boon companion! This very garden, filled as it is  with curious herbs and trees sent from the Eastern climes, better becomes the  harem of an unbelieving Emir, than the plot which Christian Monks should devote  to raise their homely pot-herbs.&mdash;And O, Conrade! well it were that the  relaxation of discipline stopped even here!&mdash;Well thou knowest that we  were forbidden to receive those devout women, who at the beginning were  associated as sisters of our Order, because, saith the forty-sixth chapter, the  Ancient Enemy hath, by female society, withdrawn many from the right path to  paradise. Nay, in the last capital, being, as it were, the cope-stone which our  blessed founder placed on the pure and undefiled doctrine which he had  enjoined, we are prohibited from offering, even to our sisters and our mothers,  the kiss of affection&mdash;&lsquo;ut omnium mulierum fugiantur  oscula&rsquo;.&mdash;I shame to speak&mdash;I shame to think&mdash;of the  corruptions which have rushed in upon us even like a flood. The souls of our  pure founders, the spirits of Hugh de Payen and Godfrey de Saint Omer, and of  the blessed Seven who first joined in dedicating their lives to the service of  the Temple, are disturbed even in the enjoyment of paradise itself. I have seen  them, Conrade, in the visions of the night&mdash;their sainted eyes shed tears  for the sins and follies of their brethren, and for the foul and shameful  luxury in which they wallow. Beaumanoir, they say, thou slumberest&mdash;awake!  There is a stain in the fabric of the Temple, deep and foul as that left by the  streaks of leprosy on the walls of the infected houses of old.   50            &ldquo;The soldiers of the Cross, who should shun the glance of a woman as the  eye of a basilisk, live in open sin, not with the females of their own race  only, but with the daughters of the accursed heathen, and more accursed Jew.  Beaumanoir, thou sleepest; up, and avenge our cause!&mdash;Slay the sinners,  male and female!&mdash;Take to thee the brand of Phineas!&mdash;The vision  fled, Conrade, but as I awaked I could still hear the clank of their mail, and  see the waving of their white mantles.&mdash;And I will do according to their  word, I WILL purify the fabric of the Temple! and the unclean stones in which  the plague is, I will remove and cast out of the building.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Yet bethink thee, reverend father,&rdquo; said Mont-Fitchet, &ldquo;the  stain hath become engrained by time and consuetude; let thy reformation be  cautious, as it is just and wise.&rdquo;          &ldquo;No, Mont-Fitchet,&rdquo; answered the stern old man&mdash;&ldquo;it must  be sharp and sudden&mdash;the Order is on the crisis of its fate. The sobriety,  self-devotion, and piety of our predecessors, made us powerful  friends&mdash;our presumption, our wealth, our luxury, have raised up against  us mighty enemies.&mdash;We must cast away these riches, which are a temptation  to princes&mdash;we must lay down that presumption, which is an offence to  them&mdash;we must reform that license of manners, which is a scandal to the  whole Christian world! Or&mdash;mark my words&mdash;the Order of the Temple  will be utterly demolished&mdash;and the Place thereof shall no more be known  among the nations.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Now may God avert such a calamity!&rdquo; said the Preceptor.          &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; said the Grand Master, with solemnity, &ldquo;but we must  deserve his aid. I tell thee, Conrade, that neither the powers in Heaven, nor  the powers on earth, will longer endure the wickedness of this  generation&mdash;My intelligence is sure&mdash;the ground on which our fabric  is reared is already undermined, and each addition we make to the structure of  our greatness will only sink it the sooner in the abyss. We must retrace our  steps, and show ourselves the faithful Champions of the Cross, sacrificing to  our calling, not alone our blood and our lives&mdash;not alone our lusts and  our vices&mdash;but our ease, our comforts, and our natural affections, and act  as men convinced that many a pleasure which may be lawful to others, is  forbidden to the vowed soldier of the Temple.&rdquo;          At this moment a squire, clothed in a threadbare vestment, (for the aspirants  after this holy Order wore during their noviciate the cast-off garments of the  knights,) entered the garden, and, bowing profoundly before the Grand Master,  stood silent, awaiting his permission ere he presumed to tell his errand.          &ldquo;Is it not more seemly,&rdquo; said the Grand Master, &ldquo;to see this  Damian, clothed in the garments of Christian humility, thus appear with  reverend silence before his Superior, than but two days since, when the fond  fool was decked in a painted coat, and jangling as pert and as proud as any  popinjay?&mdash;Speak, Damian, we permit thee&mdash;What is thine  errand?&rdquo;          &ldquo;A Jew stands without the gate, noble and reverend father,&rdquo; said  the Squire, &ldquo;who prays to speak with brother Brian de  Bois-Guilbert.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou wert right to give me knowledge of it,&rdquo; said the Grand  Master; &ldquo;in our presence a Preceptor is but as a common compeer of our  Order, who may not walk according to his own will, but to that of his  Master&mdash;even according to the text, &lsquo;In the hearing of the ear he  hath obeyed me.&rsquo;&mdash;It imports us especially to know of this  Bois-Guilbert&rsquo;s proceedings,&rdquo; said he, turning to his companion.          &ldquo;Report speaks him brave and valiant,&rdquo; said Conrade.          &ldquo;And truly is he so spoken of,&rdquo; said the Grand Master; &ldquo;in  our valour only we are not degenerated from our predecessors, the heroes of the  Cross. But brother Brian came into our Order a moody and disappointed man,  stirred, I doubt me, to take our vows and to renounce the world, not in  sincerity of soul, but as one whom some touch of light discontent had driven  into penitence. Since then, he hath become an active and earnest agitator, a  murmurer, and a machinator, and a leader amongst those who impugn our  authority; not considering that the rule is given to the Master even by the  symbol of the staff and the rod&mdash;the staff to support the infirmities of  the weak&mdash;the rod to correct the faults of  delinquents.&mdash;Damian,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;lead the Jew to our  presence.&rdquo;          The squire departed with a profound reverence, and in a few minutes returned,  marshalling in Isaac of York. No naked slave, ushered into the presence of some  mighty prince, could approach his judgment-seat with more profound reverence  and terror than that with which the Jew drew near to the presence of the Grand  Master. When he had approached within the distance of three yards, Beaumanoir  made a sign with his staff that he should come no farther. The Jew kneeled down  on the earth which he kissed in token of reverence; then rising, stood before  the Templars, his hands folded on his bosom, his head bowed on his breast, in  all the submission of Oriental slavery.          &ldquo;Damian,&rdquo; said the Grand Master, &ldquo;retire, and have a guard  ready to await our sudden call; and suffer no one to enter the garden until we  shall leave it.&rdquo;&mdash;The squire bowed and  retreated.&mdash;&ldquo;Jew,&rdquo; continued the haughty old man, &ldquo;mark  me. It suits not our condition to hold with thee long communication, nor do we  waste words or time upon any one. Wherefore be brief in thy answers to what  questions I shall ask thee, and let thy words be of truth; for if thy tongue  doubles with me, I will have it torn from thy misbelieving jaws.&rdquo;          The Jew was about to reply, but the Grand Master went on.          &ldquo;Peace, unbeliever!&mdash;not a word in our presence, save in answer to  our questions.&mdash;What is thy business with our brother Brian de  Bois-Guilbert?&rdquo;          Isaac gasped with terror and uncertainty. To tell his tale might be interpreted  into scandalizing the Order; yet, unless he told it, what hope could he have of  achieving his daughter&rsquo;s deliverance? Beaumanoir saw his mortal  apprehension, and condescended to give him some assurance.          &ldquo;Fear nothing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for thy wretched person, Jew, so  thou dealest uprightly in this matter. I demand again to know from thee thy  business with Brian de Bois-Guilbert?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I am bearer of a letter,&rdquo; stammered out the Jew, &ldquo;so please  your reverend valour, to that good knight, from Prior Aymer of the Abbey of  Jorvaulx.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Said I not these were evil times, Conrade?&rdquo; said the Master.  &ldquo;A Cistertian Prior sends a letter to a soldier of the Temple, and can  find no more fitting messenger than an unbelieving Jew.&mdash;Give me the  letter.&rdquo;          The Jew, with trembling hands, undid the folds of his Armenian cap, in which he  had deposited the Prior&rsquo;s tablets for the greater security, and was about  to approach, with hand extended and body crouched, to place it within the reach  of his grim interrogator.          &ldquo;Back, dog!&rdquo; said the Grand Master; &ldquo;I touch not  misbelievers, save with the sword.&mdash;Conrade, take thou the letter from the  Jew, and give it to me.&rdquo;          Beaumanoir, being thus possessed of the tablets, inspected the outside  carefully, and then proceeded to undo the packthread which secured its folds.  &ldquo;Reverend father,&rdquo; said Conrade, interposing, though with much  deference, &ldquo;wilt thou break the seal?&rdquo;          &ldquo;And will I not?&rdquo; said Beaumanoir, with a frown. &ldquo;Is it not  written in the forty-second capital, &lsquo;De Lectione Literarum&rsquo; that a  Templar shall not receive a letter, no not from his father, without  communicating the same to the Grand Master, and reading it in his  presence?&rdquo;          He then perused the letter in haste, with an expression of surprise and horror;  read it over again more slowly; then holding it out to Conrade with one hand,  and slightly striking it with the other, exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Here is goodly  stuff for one Christian man to write to another, and both members, and no  inconsiderable members, of religious professions! When,&rdquo; said he  solemnly, and looking upward, &ldquo;wilt thou come with thy fanners to purge  the thrashing-floor?&rdquo;          Mont-Fitchet took the letter from his Superior, and was about to peruse it.          &ldquo;Read it aloud, Conrade,&rdquo; said the Grand Master,&mdash;&ldquo;and  do thou&rdquo; (to Isaac) &ldquo;attend to the purport of it, for we will  question thee concerning it.&rdquo;          Conrade read the letter, which was in these words: &ldquo;Aymer, by divine  grace, Prior of the Cistertian house of Saint Mary&rsquo;s of Jorvaulx, to Sir  Brian de Bois-Guilbert, a Knight of the holy Order of the Temple, wisheth  health, with the bounties of King Bacchus and of my Lady Venus. Touching our  present condition, dear Brother, we are a captive in the hands of certain  lawless and godless men, who have not feared to detain our person, and put us  to ransom; whereby we have also learned of Front-de-Bœuf&rsquo;s misfortune,  and that thou hast escaped with that fair Jewish sorceress, whose black eyes  have bewitched thee. We are heartily rejoiced of thy safety; nevertheless, we  pray thee to be on thy guard in the matter of this second Witch of Endor; for  we are privately assured that your Great Master, who careth not a bean for  cherry cheeks and black eyes, comes from Normandy to diminish your mirth, and  amend your misdoings. Wherefore we pray you heartily to beware, and to be found  watching, even as the Holy Text hath it, &lsquo;Invenientur vigilantes&rsquo;.  And the wealthy Jew her father, Isaac of York, having prayed of me letters in  his behalf, I gave him these, earnestly advising, and in a sort entreating,  that you do hold the damsel to ransom, seeing he will pay you from his bags as  much as may find fifty damsels upon safer terms, whereof I trust to have my  part when we make merry together, as true brothers, not forgetting the  wine-cup. For what saith the text, &lsquo;Vinum laetificat cor hominis&rsquo;;  and again, &lsquo;Rex delectabitur pulchritudine tua&rsquo;.          &ldquo;Till which merry meeting, we wish you farewell. Given from this den of  thieves, about the hour of matins,          &ldquo;Aymer Pr. S. M. Jorvolciencis.          &ldquo;&lsquo;Postscriptum.&rsquo; Truly your golden chain hath not long  abidden with me, and will now sustain, around the neck of an outlaw  deer-stealer, the whistle wherewith he calleth on his hounds.&rdquo;          &ldquo;What sayest thou to this, Conrade?&rdquo; said the Grand  Master&mdash;&ldquo;Den of thieves! and a fit residence is a den of thieves for  such a Prior. No wonder that the hand of God is upon us, and that in the Holy  Land we lose place by place, foot by foot, before the infidels, when we have  such churchmen as this Aymer.&mdash;And what meaneth he, I trow, by this second  Witch of Endor?&rdquo; said he to his confident, something apart. Conrade was  better acquainted (perhaps by practice) with the jargon of gallantry, than was  his Superior; and he expounded the passage which embarrassed the Grand Master,  to be a sort of language used by worldly men towards those whom they loved  &lsquo;par amours&rsquo;; but the explanation did not satisfy the bigoted  Beaumanoir.          &ldquo;There is more in it than thou dost guess, Conrade; thy simplicity is no  match for this deep abyss of wickedness. This Rebecca of York was a pupil of  that Miriam of whom thou hast heard. Thou shalt hear the Jew own it even  now.&rdquo; Then turning to Isaac, he said aloud, &ldquo;Thy daughter, then, is  prisoner with Brian de Bois-Guilbert?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay, reverend valorous sir,&rdquo; stammered poor Isaac, &ldquo;and  whatsoever ransom a poor man may pay for her deliverance&mdash;-&rdquo;          &ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; said the Grand Master. &ldquo;This thy daughter hath  practised the art of healing, hath she not?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay, gracious sir,&rdquo; answered the Jew, with more confidence;  &ldquo;and knight and yeoman, squire and vassal, may bless the goodly gift  which Heaven hath assigned to her. Many a one can testify that she hath  recovered them by her art, when every other human aid hath proved vain; but the  blessing of the God of Jacob was upon her.&rdquo;          Beaumanoir turned to Mont-Fitchet with a grim smile. &ldquo;See,  brother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the deceptions of the devouring Enemy! Behold  the baits with which he fishes for souls, giving a poor space of earthly life  in exchange for eternal happiness hereafter. Well said our blessed rule,  &lsquo;Semper percutiatur leo vorans&rsquo;.&mdash;Up on the lion! Down with  the destroyer!&rdquo; said he, shaking aloft his mystic abacus, as if in  defiance of the powers of darkness&mdash;&ldquo;Thy daughter worketh the cures,  I doubt not,&rdquo; thus he went on to address the Jew, &ldquo;by words and  sighs, and periapts, and other cabalistical mysteries.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay, reverend and brave Knight,&rdquo; answered Isaac, &ldquo;but in  chief measure by a balsam of marvellous virtue.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Where had she that secret?&rdquo; said Beaumanoir.          &ldquo;It was delivered to her,&rdquo; answered Isaac, reluctantly, &ldquo;by  Miriam, a sage matron of our tribe.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ah, false Jew!&rdquo; said the Grand Master; &ldquo;was it not from that  same witch Miriam, the abomination of whose enchantments have been heard of  throughout every Christian land?&rdquo; exclaimed the Grand Master, crossing  himself. &ldquo;Her body was burnt at a stake, and her ashes were scattered to  the four winds; and so be it with me and mine Order, if I do not as much to her  pupil, and more also! I will teach her to throw spell and incantation over the  soldiers of the blessed Temple.&mdash;There, Damian, spurn this Jew from the  gate&mdash;shoot him dead if he oppose or turn again. With his daughter we will  deal as the Christian law and our own high office warrant.&rdquo;          Poor Isaac was hurried off accordingly, and expelled from the preceptory; all  his entreaties, and even his offers, unheard and disregarded. He could do not  better than return to the house of the Rabbi, and endeavour, through his means,  to learn how his daughter was to be disposed of. He had hitherto feared for her  honour, he was now to tremble for her life. Meanwhile, the Grand Master ordered  to his presence the Preceptor of Templestowe.                     CHAPTER XXXVI        Say not my art is fraud&mdash;all live by seeming.   The beggar begs with it, and the gay courtier   Gains land and title, rank and rule, by seeming;   The clergy scorn it not, and the bold soldier   Will eke with it his service.&mdash;All admit it,   All practise it; and he who is content   With showing what he is, shall have small credit   In church, or camp, or state&mdash;So wags the world.          O LD  P LAY           Albert Malvoisin, President, or, in the language of the Order, Preceptor of the  establishment of Templestowe, was brother to that Philip Malvoisin who has been  already occasionally mentioned in this history, and was, like that baron, in  close league with Brian de Bois-Guilbert.          Amongst dissolute and unprincipled men, of whom the Temple Order included but  too many, Albert of Templestowe might be distinguished; but with this  difference from the audacious Bois-Guilbert, that he knew how to throw over his  vices and his ambition the veil of hypocrisy, and to assume in his exterior the  fanaticism which he internally despised. Had not the arrival of the Grand  Master been so unexpectedly sudden, he would have seen nothing at Templestowe  which might have appeared to argue any relaxation of discipline. And, even  although surprised, and, to a certain extent, detected, Albert Malvoisin  listened with such respect and apparent contrition to the rebuke of his  Superior, and made such haste to reform the particulars he  censured,&mdash;succeeded, in fine, so well in giving an air of ascetic  devotion to a family which had been lately devoted to license and pleasure,  that Lucas Beaumanoir began to entertain a higher opinion of the  Preceptor&rsquo;s morals, than the first appearance of the establishment had  inclined him to adopt.          But these favourable sentiments on the part of the Grand Master were greatly  shaken by the intelligence that Albert had received within a house of religion  the Jewish captive, and, as was to be feared, the paramour of a brother of the  Order; and when Albert appeared before him, he was regarded with unwonted  sternness.          &ldquo;There is in this mansion, dedicated to the purposes of the holy Order of  the Temple,&rdquo; said the Grand Master, in a severe tone, &ldquo;a Jewish  woman, brought hither by a brother of religion, by your connivance, Sir  Preceptor.&rdquo;          Albert Malvoisin was overwhelmed with confusion; for the unfortunate Rebecca  had been confined in a remote and secret part of the building, and every  precaution used to prevent her residence there from being known. He read in the  looks of Beaumanoir ruin to Bois-Guilbert and to himself, unless he should be  able to avert the impending storm.          &ldquo;Why are you mute?&rdquo; continued the Grand Master.          &ldquo;Is it permitted to me to reply?&rdquo; answered the Preceptor, in a tone  of the deepest humility, although by the question he only meant to gain an  instant&rsquo;s space for arranging his ideas.          &ldquo;Speak, you are permitted,&rdquo; said the Grand  Master&mdash;&ldquo;speak, and say, knowest thou the capital of our holy  rule,&mdash;&lsquo;De commilitonibus Templi in sancta civitate, qui cum  miserrimis mulieribus versantur, propter oblectationem carnis?&rsquo;&rdquo;   51            &ldquo;Surely, most reverend father,&rdquo; answered the Preceptor, &ldquo;I  have not risen to this office in the Order, being ignorant of one of its most  important prohibitions.&rdquo;          &ldquo;How comes it, then, I demand of thee once more, that thou hast suffered  a brother to bring a paramour, and that paramour a Jewish sorceress, into this  holy place, to the stain and pollution thereof?&rdquo;          &ldquo;A Jewish sorceress!&rdquo; echoed Albert Malvoisin; &ldquo;good angels  guard us!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay, brother, a Jewish sorceress!&rdquo; said the Grand Master, sternly.  &ldquo;I have said it. Darest thou deny that this Rebecca, the daughter of that  wretched usurer Isaac of York, and the pupil of the foul witch Miriam, is  now&mdash;shame to be thought or spoken!&mdash;lodged within this thy  Preceptory?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Your wisdom, reverend father,&rdquo; answered the Preceptor, &ldquo;hath  rolled away the darkness from my understanding. Much did I wonder that so good  a knight as Brian de Bois-Guilbert seemed so fondly besotted on the charms of  this female, whom I received into this house merely to place a bar betwixt  their growing intimacy, which else might have been cemented at the expense of  the fall of our valiant and religious brother.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Hath nothing, then, as yet passed betwixt them in breach of his  vow?&rdquo; demanded the Grand Master.          &ldquo;What! under this roof?&rdquo; said the Preceptor, crossing himself;  &ldquo;Saint Magdalene and the ten thousand virgins forbid!&mdash;No! if I have  sinned in receiving her here, it was in the erring thought that I might thus  break off our brother&rsquo;s besotted devotion to this Jewess, which seemed to  me so wild and unnatural, that I could not but ascribe it to some touch of  insanity, more to be cured by pity than reproof. But since your reverend wisdom  hath discovered this Jewish queen to be a sorceress, perchance it may account  fully for his enamoured folly.&rdquo;          &ldquo;It doth!&mdash;it doth!&rdquo; said Beaumanoir. &ldquo;See, brother  Conrade, the peril of yielding to the first devices and blandishments of Satan!  We look upon woman only to gratify the lust of the eye, and to take pleasure in  what men call her beauty; and the Ancient Enemy, the devouring Lion, obtains  power over us, to complete, by talisman and spell, a work which was begun by  idleness and folly. It may be that our brother Bois-Guilbert does in this  matter deserve rather pity than severe chastisement; rather the support of the  staff, than the strokes of the rod; and that our admonitions and prayers may  turn him from his folly, and restore him to his brethren.&rdquo;          &ldquo;It were deep pity,&rdquo; said Conrade Mont-Fitchet, &ldquo;to lose to  the Order one of its best lances, when the Holy Community most requires the aid  of its sons. Three hundred Saracens hath this Brian de Bois-Guilbert slain with  his own hand.&rdquo;          &ldquo;The blood of these accursed dogs,&rdquo; said the Grand Master,  &ldquo;shall be a sweet and acceptable offering to the saints and angels whom  they despise and blaspheme; and with their aid will we counteract the spells  and charms with which our brother is entwined as in a net. He shall burst the  bands of this Delilah, as Sampson burst the two new cords with which the  Philistines had bound him, and shall slaughter the infidels, even heaps upon  heaps. But concerning this foul witch, who hath flung her enchantments over a  brother of the Holy Temple, assuredly she shall die the death.&rdquo;          &ldquo;But the laws of England,&rdquo;&mdash;said the Preceptor, who, though  delighted that the Grand Master&rsquo;s resentment, thus fortunately averted  from himself and Bois-Guilbert, had taken another direction, began now to fear  he was carrying it too far.          &ldquo;The laws of England,&rdquo; interrupted Beaumanoir, &ldquo;permit and  enjoin each judge to execute justice within his own jurisdiction. The most  petty baron may arrest, try, and condemn a witch found within his own domain.  And shall that power be denied to the Grand Master of the Temple within a  preceptory of his Order?&mdash;No!&mdash;we will judge and condemn. The witch  shall be taken out of the land, and the wickedness thereof shall be forgiven.  Prepare the Castle-hall for the trial of the sorceress.&rdquo;          Albert Malvoisin bowed and retired,&mdash;not to give directions for preparing  the hall, but to seek out Brian de Bois-Guilbert, and communicate to him how  matters were likely to terminate. It was not long ere he found him, foaming  with indignation at a repulse he had anew sustained from the fair Jewess.  &ldquo;The unthinking,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the ungrateful, to scorn him who,  amidst blood and flames, would have saved her life at the risk of his own! By  Heaven, Malvoisin! I abode until roof and rafters crackled and crashed around  me. I was the butt of a hundred arrows; they rattled on mine armour like  hailstones against a latticed casement, and the only use I made of my shield  was for her protection. This did I endure for her; and now the self-willed girl  upbraids me that I did not leave her to perish, and refuses me not only the  slightest proof of gratitude, but even the most distant hope that ever she will  be brought to grant any. The devil, that possessed her race with obstinacy, has  concentrated its full force in her single person!&rdquo;          &ldquo;The devil,&rdquo; said the Preceptor, &ldquo;I think, possessed you  both. How oft have I preached to you caution, if not continence? Did I not tell  you that there were enough willing Christian damsels to be met with, who would  think it sin to refuse so brave a knight &lsquo;le don d&rsquo;amoureux  merci&rsquo;, and you must needs anchor your affection on a wilful, obstinate  Jewess! By the mass, I think old Lucas Beaumanoir guesses right, when he  maintains she hath cast a spell over you.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Lucas Beaumanoir!&rdquo;&mdash;said Bois-Guilbert  reproachfully&mdash;&ldquo;Are these your precautions, Malvoisin? Hast thou  suffered the dotard to learn that Rebecca is in the Preceptory?&rdquo;          &ldquo;How could I help it?&rdquo; said the Preceptor. &ldquo;I neglected  nothing that could keep secret your mystery; but it is betrayed, and whether by  the devil or no, the devil only can tell. But I have turned the matter as I  could; you are safe if you renounce Rebecca. You are pitied&mdash;the victim of  magical delusion. She is a sorceress, and must suffer as such.&rdquo;          &ldquo;She shall not, by Heaven!&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert.          &ldquo;By Heaven, she must and will!&rdquo; said Malvoisin. &ldquo;Neither you  nor any one else can save her. Lucas Beaumanoir hath settled that the death of  a Jewess will be a sin-offering sufficient to atone for all the amorous  indulgences of the Knights Templars; and thou knowest he hath both the power  and will to execute so reasonable and pious a purpose.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Will future ages believe that such stupid bigotry ever existed!&rdquo;  said Bois-Guilbert, striding up and down the apartment.          &ldquo;What they may believe, I know not,&rdquo; said Malvoisin, calmly;  &ldquo;but I know well, that in this our day, clergy and laymen, take  ninety-nine to the hundred, will cry &lsquo;amen&rsquo; to the Grand  Master&rsquo;s sentence.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I have it,&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert. &ldquo;Albert, thou art my friend.  Thou must connive at her escape, Malvoisin, and I will transport her to some  place of greater security and secrecy.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I cannot, if I would,&rdquo; replied the Preceptor; &ldquo;the mansion  is filled with the attendants of the Grand Master, and others who are devoted  to him. And, to be frank with you, brother, I would not embark with you in this  matter, even if I could hope to bring my bark to haven. I have risked enough  already for your sake. I have no mind to encounter a sentence of degradation,  or even to lose my Preceptory, for the sake of a painted piece of Jewish flesh  and blood. And you, if you will be guided by my counsel, will give up this  wild-goose chase, and fly your hawk at some other game. Think,  Bois-Guilbert,&mdash;thy present rank, thy future honours, all depend on thy  place in the Order. Shouldst thou adhere perversely to thy passion for this  Rebecca, thou wilt give Beaumanoir the power of expelling thee, and he will not  neglect it. He is jealous of the truncheon which he holds in his trembling  gripe, and he knows thou stretchest thy bold hand towards it. Doubt not he will  ruin thee, if thou affordest him a pretext so fair as thy protection of a  Jewish sorceress. Give him his scope in this matter, for thou canst not control  him. When the staff is in thine own firm grasp, thou mayest caress the  daughters of Judah, or burn them, as may best suit thine own humour.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Malvoisin,&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert, &ldquo;thou art a  cold-blooded&mdash;&rdquo;          &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; said the Preceptor, hastening to fill up the blank, in  which Bois-Guilbert would probably have placed a worse word,&mdash;&ldquo;a  cold-blooded friend I am, and therefore more fit to give thee advice. I tell  thee once more, that thou canst not save Rebecca. I tell thee once more, thou  canst but perish with her. Go hie thee to the Grand Master&mdash;throw thyself  at his feet and tell him&mdash;&rdquo;          &ldquo;Not at his feet, by Heaven! but to the dotard&rsquo;s very beard will I  say&mdash;&rdquo;          &ldquo;Say to him, then, to his beard,&rdquo; continued Malvoisin, coolly,  &ldquo;that you love this captive Jewess to distraction; and the more thou dost  enlarge on thy passion, the greater will be his haste to end it by the death of  the fair enchantress; while thou, taken in flagrant delict by the avowal of a  crime contrary to thine oath, canst hope no aid of thy brethren, and must  exchange all thy brilliant visions of ambition and power, to lift perhaps a  mercenary spear in some of the petty quarrels between Flanders and  Burgundy.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou speakest the truth, Malvoisin,&rdquo; said Brian de Bois-Guilbert,  after a moment&rsquo;s reflection. &ldquo;I will give the hoary bigot no  advantage over me; and for Rebecca, she hath not merited at my hand that I  should expose rank and honour for her sake. I will cast her off&mdash;yes, I  will leave her to her fate, unless&mdash;&rdquo;          &ldquo;Qualify not thy wise and necessary resolution,&rdquo; said Malvoisin;  &ldquo;women are but the toys which amuse our lighter hours&mdash;ambition is  the serious business of life. Perish a thousand such frail baubles as this  Jewess, before thy manly step pause in the brilliant career that lies stretched  before thee! For the present we part, nor must we be seen to hold close  conversation&mdash;I must order the hall for his judgment-seat.&rdquo;          &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert, &ldquo;so soon?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; replied the Preceptor, &ldquo;trial moves rapidly on when the  judge has determined the sentence beforehand.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Rebecca,&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert, when he was left alone, &ldquo;thou  art like to cost me dear&mdash;Why cannot I abandon thee to thy fate, as this  calm hypocrite recommends?&mdash;One effort will I make to save thee&mdash;but  beware of ingratitude! for if I am again repulsed, my vengeance shall equal my  love. The life and honour of Bois-Guilbert must not be hazarded, where contempt  and reproaches are his only reward.&rdquo;          The Preceptor had hardly given the necessary orders, when he was joined by  Conrade Mont-Fitchet, who acquainted him with the Grand Master&rsquo;s  resolution to bring the Jewess to instant trial for sorcery.          &ldquo;It is surely a dream,&rdquo; said the Preceptor; &ldquo;we have many  Jewish physicians, and we call them not wizards though they work wonderful  cures.&rdquo;          &ldquo;The Grand Master thinks otherwise,&rdquo; said Mont-Fitchet; &ldquo;and,  Albert, I will be upright with thee&mdash;wizard or not, it were better that  this miserable damsel die, than that Brian de Bois-Guilbert should be lost to  the Order, or the Order divided by internal dissension. Thou knowest his high  rank, his fame in arms&mdash;thou knowest the zeal with which many of our  brethren regard him&mdash;but all this will not avail him with our Grand  Master, should he consider Brian as the accomplice, not the victim, of this  Jewess. Were the souls of the twelve tribes in her single body, it were better  she suffered alone, than that Bois-Guilbert were partner in her  destruction.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I have been working him even now to abandon her,&rdquo; said Malvoisin;  &ldquo;but still, are there grounds enough to condemn this Rebecca for  sorcery?&mdash;Will not the Grand Master change his mind when he sees that the  proofs are so weak?&rdquo;          &ldquo;They must be strengthened, Albert,&rdquo; replied Mont-Fitchet,  &ldquo;they must be strengthened. Dost thou understand me?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said the Preceptor, &ldquo;nor do I scruple to do aught for  advancement of the Order&mdash;but there is little time to find engines  fitting.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Malvoisin, they MUST be found,&rdquo; said Conrade; &ldquo;well will it  advantage both the Order and thee. This Templestowe is a poor  Preceptory&mdash;that of Maison-Dieu is worth double its value&mdash;thou  knowest my interest with our old Chief&mdash;find those who can carry this  matter through, and thou art Preceptor of Maison-Dieu in the fertile  Kent&mdash;How sayst thou?&rdquo;          &ldquo;There is,&rdquo; replied Malvoisin, &ldquo;among those who came hither  with Bois-Guilbert, two fellows whom I well know; servants they were to my  brother Philip de Malvoisin, and passed from his service to that of  Front-de-Bœuf&mdash;It may be they know something of the witcheries of this  woman.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Away, seek them out instantly&mdash;and hark thee, if a byzant or two  will sharpen their memory, let them not be wanting.&rdquo;          &ldquo;They would swear the mother that bore them a sorceress for a  zecchin,&rdquo; said the Preceptor.          &ldquo;Away, then,&rdquo; said Mont-Fitchet; &ldquo;at noon the affair will  proceed. I have not seen our senior in such earnest preparation since he  condemned to the stake Hamet Alfagi, a convert who relapsed to the Moslem  faith.&rdquo;          The ponderous castle-bell had tolled the point of noon, when Rebecca heard a  trampling of feet upon the private stair which led to her place of confinement.  The noise announced the arrival of several persons, and the circumstance rather  gave her joy; for she was more afraid of the solitary visits of the fierce and  passionate Bois-Guilbert than of any evil that could befall her besides. The  door of the chamber was unlocked, and Conrade and the Preceptor Malvoisin  entered, attended by four warders clothed in black, and bearing halberds.          &ldquo;Daughter of an accursed race!&rdquo; said the Preceptor, &ldquo;arise  and follow us.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Whither,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;and for what purpose?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Damsel,&rdquo; answered Conrade, &ldquo;it is not for thee to question,  but to obey. Nevertheless, be it known to thee, that thou art to be brought  before the tribunal of the Grand Master of our holy Order, there to answer for  thine offences.&rdquo;          &ldquo;May the God of Abraham be praised!&rdquo; said Rebecca, folding her  hands devoutly; &ldquo;the name of a judge, though an enemy to my people, is to  me as the name of a protector. Most willingly do I follow thee&mdash;permit me  only to wrap my veil around my head.&rdquo;          They descended the stair with slow and solemn step, traversed a long gallery,  and, by a pair of folding doors placed at the end, entered the great hall in  which the Grand Master had for the time established his court of justice.          The lower part of this ample apartment was filled with squires and yeomen, who  made way not without some difficulty for Rebecca, attended by the Preceptor and  Mont-Fitchet, and followed by the guard of halberdiers, to move forward to the  seat appointed for her. As she passed through the crowd, her arms folded and  her head depressed, a scrap of paper was thrust into her hand, which she  received almost unconsciously, and continued to hold without examining its  contents. The assurance that she possessed some friend in this awful assembly  gave her courage to look around, and to mark into whose presence she had been  conducted. She gazed, accordingly, upon the scene, which we shall endeavour to  describe in the next chapter.                     CHAPTER XXXVII        Stern was the law which bade its vot&rsquo;ries leave   At human woes with human hearts to grieve;   Stern was the law, which at the winning wile   Of frank and harmless mirth forbade to smile;   But sterner still, when high the iron-rod   Of tyrant power she shook, and call&rsquo;d that power of God.          T HE  M IDDLE  A GES           The Tribunal, erected for the trial of the innocent and unhappy Rebecca,  occupied the dais or elevated part of the upper end of the great hall&mdash;a  platform, which we have already described as the place of honour, destined to  be occupied by the most distinguished inhabitants or guests of an ancient  mansion.          On an elevated seat, directly before the accused, sat the Grand Master of the  Temple, in full and ample robes of flowing white, holding in his hand the  mystic staff, which bore the symbol of the Order. At his feet was placed a  table, occupied by two scribes, chaplains of the Order, whose duty it was to  reduce to formal record the proceedings of the day. The black dresses, bare  scalps, and demure looks of these church-men, formed a strong contrast to the  warlike appearance of the knights who attended, either as residing in the  Preceptory, or as come thither to attend upon their Grand Master. The  Preceptors, of whom there were four present, occupied seats lower in height,  and somewhat drawn back behind that of their superior; and the knights, who  enjoyed no such rank in the Order, were placed on benches still lower, and  preserving the same distance from the Preceptors as these from the Grand  Master. Behind them, but still upon the dais or elevated portion of the hall,  stood the esquires of the Order, in white dresses of an inferior quality.          The whole assembly wore an aspect of the most profound gravity; and in the  faces of the knights might be perceived traces of military daring, united with  the solemn carriage becoming men of a religious profession, and which, in the  presence of their Grand Master, failed not to sit upon every brow.          The remaining and lower part of the hall was filled with guards, holding  partisans, and with other attendants whom curiosity had drawn thither, to see  at once a Grand Master and a Jewish sorceress. By far the greater part of those  inferior persons were, in one rank or other, connected with the Order, and were  accordingly distinguished by their black dresses. But peasants from the  neighbouring country were not refused admittance; for it was the pride of  Beaumanoir to render the edifying spectacle of the justice which he  administered as public as possible. His large blue eyes seemed to expand as he  gazed around the assembly, and his countenance appeared elated by the conscious  dignity, and imaginary merit, of the part which he was about to perform. A  psalm, which he himself accompanied with a deep mellow voice, which age had not  deprived of its powers, commenced the proceedings of the day; and the solemn  sounds, &ldquo;Venite exultemus Domino&rdquo;, so often sung by the Templars  before engaging with earthly adversaries, was judged by Lucas most appropriate  to introduce the approaching triumph, for such he deemed it, over the powers of  darkness. The deep prolonged notes, raised by a hundred masculine voices  accustomed to combine in the choral chant, arose to the vaulted roof of the  hall, and rolled on amongst its arches with the pleasing yet solemn sound of  the rushing of mighty waters.          When the sounds ceased, the Grand Master glanced his eye slowly around the  circle, and observed that the seat of one of the Preceptors was vacant. Brian  de Bois-Guilbert, by whom it had been occupied, had left his place, and was now  standing near the extreme corner of one of the benches occupied by the Knights  Companions of the Temple, one hand extending his long mantle, so as in some  degree to hide his face; while the other held his cross-handled sword, with the  point of which, sheathed as it was, he was slowly drawing lines upon the oaken  floor.          &ldquo;Unhappy man!&rdquo; said the Grand Master, after favouring him with a  glance of compassion. &ldquo;Thou seest, Conrade, how this holy work distresses  him. To this can the light look of woman, aided by the Prince of the Powers of  this world, bring a valiant and worthy knight!&mdash;Seest thou he cannot look  upon us; he cannot look upon her; and who knows by what impulse from his  tormentor his hand forms these cabalistic lines upon the floor?&mdash;It may be  our life and safety are thus aimed at; but we spit at and defy the foul enemy.  &lsquo;Semper Leo percutiatur!&rsquo;&rdquo;          This was communicated apart to his confidential follower, Conrade Mont-Fitchet.  The Grand Master then raised his voice, and addressed the assembly.          &ldquo;Reverend and valiant men, Knights, Preceptors, and Companions of this  Holy Order, my brethren and my children!&mdash;you also, well-born and pious  Esquires, who aspire to wear this holy Cross!&mdash;and you also, Christian  brethren, of every degree!&mdash;Be it known to you, that it is not defect of  power in us which hath occasioned the assembling of this congregation; for,  however unworthy in our person, yet to us is committed, with this batoon, full  power to judge and to try all that regards the weal of this our Holy Order.  Holy Saint Bernard, in the rule of our knightly and religious profession, hath  said, in the fifty-ninth capital,   53   that he would not that brethren be  called together in council, save at the will and command of the Master; leaving  it free to us, as to those more worthy fathers who have preceded us in this our  office, to judge, as well of the occasion as of the time and place in which a  chapter of the whole Order, or of any part thereof, may be convoked. Also, in  all such chapters, it is our duty to hear the advice of our brethren, and to  proceed according to our own pleasure. But when the raging wolf hath made an  inroad upon the flock, and carried off one member thereof, it is the duty of  the kind shepherd to call his comrades together, that with bows and slings they  may quell the invader, according to our well-known rule, that the lion is ever  to be beaten down. We have therefore summoned to our presence a Jewish woman,  by name Rebecca, daughter of Isaac of York&mdash;a woman infamous for  sortileges and for witcheries; whereby she hath maddened the blood, and  besotted the brain, not of a churl, but of a Knight&mdash;not of a secular  Knight, but of one devoted to the service of the Holy Temple&mdash;not of a  Knight Companion, but of a Preceptor of our Order, first in honour as in place.  Our brother, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, is well known to ourselves, and to all  degrees who now hear me, as a true and zealous champion of the Cross, by whose  arm many deeds of valour have been wrought in the Holy Land, and the holy  places purified from pollution by the blood of those infidels who defiled them.  Neither have our brother&rsquo;s sagacity and prudence been less in repute  among his brethren than his valour and discipline; in so much, that knights,  both in eastern and western lands, have named De Bois-Guilbert as one who may  well be put in nomination as successor to this batoon, when it shall please  Heaven to release us from the toil of bearing it. If we were told that such a  man, so honoured, and so honourable, suddenly casting away regard for his  character, his vows, his brethren, and his prospects, had associated to himself  a Jewish damsel, wandered in this lewd company, through solitary places,  defended her person in preference to his own, and, finally, was so utterly  blinded and besotted by his folly, as to bring her even to one of our own  Preceptories, what should we say but that the noble knight was possessed by  some evil demon, or influenced by some wicked spell?&mdash;If we could suppose  it otherwise, think not rank, valour, high repute, or any earthly  consideration, should prevent us from visiting him with punishment, that the  evil thing might be removed, even according to the text, &lsquo;Auferte malum  ex vobis&rsquo;. For various and heinous are the acts of transgression against  the rule of our blessed Order in this lamentable history.&mdash;1st, He hath  walked according to his proper will, contrary to capital 33, &lsquo;Quod nullus  juxta propriam voluntatem incedat&rsquo;.&mdash;2d, He hath held communication  with an excommunicated person, capital 57, &lsquo;Ut fratres non participent  cum excommunicatis&rsquo;, and therefore hath a portion in &lsquo;Anathema  Maranatha&rsquo;.&mdash;3d, He hath conversed with strange women, contrary to  the capital, &lsquo;Ut fratres non conversantur cum extraneis  mulieribus&rsquo;.&mdash;4th, He hath not avoided, nay, he hath, it is to be  feared, solicited the kiss of woman; by which, saith the last rule of our  renowned Order, &lsquo;Ut fugiantur oscula&rsquo;, the soldiers of the Cross  are brought into a snare. For which heinous and multiplied guilt, Brian de  Bois-Guilbert should be cut off and cast out from our congregation, were he the  right hand and right eye thereof.&rdquo;          He paused. A low murmur went through the assembly. Some of the younger part,  who had been inclined to smile at the statute &lsquo;De osculis  fugiendis&rsquo;, became now grave enough, and anxiously waited what the Grand  Master was next to propose.          &ldquo;Such,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and so great should indeed be the  punishment of a Knight Templar, who wilfully offended against the rules of his  Order in such weighty points. But if, by means of charms and of spells, Satan  had obtained dominion over the Knight, perchance because he cast his eyes too  lightly upon a damsel&rsquo;s beauty, we are then rather to lament than  chastise his backsliding; and, imposing on him only such penance as may purify  him from his iniquity, we are to turn the full edge of our indignation upon the  accursed instrument, which had so well-nigh occasioned his utter falling  away.&mdash;Stand forth, therefore, and bear witness, ye who have witnessed  these unhappy doings, that we may judge of the sum and bearing thereof; and  judge whether our justice may be satisfied with the punishment of this infidel  woman, or if we must go on, with a bleeding heart, to the further proceeding  against our brother.&rdquo;          Several witnesses were called upon to prove the risks to which Bois-Guilbert  exposed himself in endeavouring to save Rebecca from the blazing castle, and  his neglect of his personal defence in attending to her safety. The men gave  these details with the exaggerations common to vulgar minds which have been  strongly excited by any remarkable event, and their natural disposition to the  marvellous was greatly increased by the satisfaction which their evidence  seemed to afford to the eminent person for whose information it had been  delivered. Thus the dangers which Bois-Guilbert surmounted, in themselves  sufficiently great, became portentous in their narrative. The devotion of the  Knight to Rebecca&rsquo;s defence was exaggerated beyond the bounds, not only  of discretion, but even of the most frantic excess of chivalrous zeal; and his  deference to what she said, even although her language was often severe and  upbraiding, was painted as carried to an excess, which, in a man of his haughty  temper, seemed almost preternatural.          The Preceptor of Templestowe was then called on to describe the manner in which  Bois-Guilbert and the Jewess arrived at the Preceptory. The evidence of  Malvoisin was skilfully guarded. But while he apparently studied to spare the  feelings of Bois-Guilbert, he threw in, from time to time, such hints, as  seemed to infer that he laboured under some temporary alienation of mind, so  deeply did he appear to be enamoured of the damsel whom he brought along with  him. With sighs of penitence, the Preceptor avowed his own contrition for  having admitted Rebecca and her lover within the walls of the  Preceptory&mdash;&ldquo;But my defence,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;has been  made in my confession to our most reverend father the Grand Master; he knows my  motives were not evil, though my conduct may have been irregular. Joyfully will  I submit to any penance he shall assign me.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou hast spoken well, Brother Albert,&rdquo; said Beaumanoir;  &ldquo;thy motives were good, since thou didst judge it right to arrest thine  erring brother in his career of precipitate folly. But thy conduct was wrong;  as he that would stop a runaway steed, and seizing by the stirrup instead of  the bridle, receiveth injury himself, instead of accomplishing his purpose.  Thirteen paternosters are assigned by our pious founder for matins, and nine  for vespers; be those services doubled by thee. Thrice a-week are Templars  permitted the use of flesh; but do thou keep fast for all the seven days. This  do for six weeks to come, and thy penance is accomplished.&rdquo;          With a hypocritical look of the deepest submission, the Preceptor of  Templestowe bowed to the ground before his Superior, and resumed his seat.          &ldquo;Were it not well, brethren,&rdquo; said the Grand Master, &ldquo;that we  examine something into the former life and conversation of this woman,  specially that we may discover whether she be one likely to use magical charms  and spells, since the truths which we have heard may well incline us to  suppose, that in this unhappy course our erring brother has been acted upon by  some infernal enticement and delusion?&rdquo;          Herman of Goodalricke was the Fourth Preceptor present; the other three were  Conrade, Malvoisin, and Bois-Guilbert himself. Herman was an ancient warrior,  whose face was marked with scars inflicted by the sabre of the Moslemah, and  had great rank and consideration among his brethren. He arose and bowed to the  Grand Master, who instantly granted him license of speech. &ldquo;I would crave  to know, most Reverend Father, of our valiant brother, Brian de Bois-Guilbert,  what he says to these wondrous accusations, and with what eye he himself now  regards his unhappy intercourse with this Jewish maiden?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Brian de Bois-Guilbert,&rdquo; said the Grand Master, &ldquo;thou  hearest the question which our Brother of Goodalricke desirest thou shouldst  answer. I command thee to reply to him.&rdquo;          Bois-Guilbert turned his head towards the Grand Master when thus addressed, and  remained silent.          &ldquo;He is possessed by a dumb devil,&rdquo; said the Grand Master.  &ldquo;Avoid thee, Sathanus!&mdash;Speak, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, I conjure  thee, by this symbol of our Holy Order.&rdquo;          Bois-Guilbert made an effort to suppress his rising scorn and indignation, the  expression of which, he was well aware, would have little availed him.  &ldquo;Brian de Bois-Guilbert,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;replies not, most  Reverend Father, to such wild and vague charges. If his honour be impeached, he  will defend it with his body, and with that sword which has often fought for  Christendom.&rdquo;          &ldquo;We forgive thee, Brother Brian,&rdquo; said the Grand Master;  &ldquo;though that thou hast boasted thy warlike achievements before us, is a  glorifying of thine own deeds, and cometh of the Enemy, who tempteth us to  exalt our own worship. But thou hast our pardon, judging thou speakest less of  thine own suggestion than from the impulse of him whom by Heaven&rsquo;s leave,  we will quell and drive forth from our assembly.&rdquo; A glance of disdain  flashed from the dark fierce eyes of Bois-Guilbert, but he made no  reply.&mdash;&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; pursued the Grand Master, &ldquo;since our  Brother of Goodalricke&rsquo;s question has been thus imperfectly answered,  pursue we our quest, brethren, and with our patron&rsquo;s assistance, we will  search to the bottom this mystery of iniquity.&mdash;Let those who have aught  to witness of the life and conversation of this Jewish woman, stand forth  before us.&rdquo; There was a bustle in the lower part of the hall, and when  the Grand Master enquired the reason, it was replied, there was in the crowd a  bedridden man, whom the prisoner had restored to the perfect use of his limbs,  by a miraculous balsam.          The poor peasant, a Saxon by birth, was dragged forward to the bar, terrified  at the penal consequences which he might have incurred by the guilt of having  been cured of the palsy by a Jewish damsel. Perfectly cured he certainly was  not, for he supported himself forward on crutches to give evidence. Most  unwilling was his testimony, and given with many tears; but he admitted that  two years since, when residing at York, he was suddenly afflicted with a sore  disease, while labouring for Isaac the rich Jew, in his vocation of a joiner;  that he had been unable to stir from his bed until the remedies applied by  Rebecca&rsquo;s directions, and especially a warming and spicy-smelling balsam,  had in some degree restored him to the use of his limbs. Moreover, he said, she  had given him a pot of that precious ointment, and furnished him with a piece  of money withal, to return to the house of his father, near to Templestowe.  &ldquo;And may it please your gracious Reverence,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;I  cannot think the damsel meant harm by me, though she hath the ill hap to be a  Jewess; for even when I used her remedy, I said the Pater and the Creed, and it  never operated a whit less kindly&mdash;&rdquo;          &ldquo;Peace, slave,&rdquo; said the Grand Master, &ldquo;and begone! It well  suits brutes like thee to be tampering and trinketing with hellish cures, and  to be giving your labour to the sons of mischief. I tell thee, the fiend can  impose diseases for the very purpose of removing them, in order to bring into  credit some diabolical fashion of cure. Hast thou that unguent of which thou  speakest?&rdquo;          The peasant, fumbling in his bosom with a trembling hand, produced a small box,  bearing some Hebrew characters on the lid, which was, with most of the  audience, a sure proof that the devil had stood apothecary. Beaumanoir, after  crossing himself, took the box into his hand, and, learned in most of the  Eastern tongues, read with ease the motto on the lid,&mdash;&ldquo;The Lion of  the tribe of Judah hath conquered.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Strange powers of Sathanas.&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;which can convert  Scripture into blasphemy, mingling poison with our necessary food!&mdash;Is  there no leech here who can tell us the ingredients of this mystic  unguent?&rdquo;          Two mediciners, as they called themselves, the one a monk, the other a barber,  appeared, and avouched they knew nothing of the materials, excepting that they  savoured of myrrh and camphire, which they took to be Oriental herbs. But with  the true professional hatred to a successful practitioner of their art, they  insinuated that, since the medicine was beyond their own knowledge, it must  necessarily have been compounded from an unlawful and magical pharmacopeia;  since they themselves, though no conjurors, fully understood every branch of  their art, so far as it might be exercised with the good faith of a Christian.  When this medical research was ended, the Saxon peasant desired humbly to have  back the medicine which he had found so salutary; but the Grand Master frowned  severely at the request. &ldquo;What is thy name, fellow?&rdquo; said he to the  cripple.          &ldquo;Higg, the son of Snell,&rdquo; answered the peasant.          &ldquo;Then Higg, son of Snell,&rdquo; said the Grand Master, &ldquo;I tell  thee it is better to be bedridden, than to accept the benefit of  unbelievers&rsquo; medicine that thou mayest arise and walk; better to despoil  infidels of their treasure by the strong hand, than to accept of them  benevolent gifts, or do them service for wages. Go thou, and do as I have  said.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Alack,&rdquo; said the peasant, &ldquo;an it shall not displease your  Reverence, the lesson comes too late for me, for I am but a maimed man; but I  will tell my two brethren, who serve the rich Rabbi Nathan Ben Samuel, that  your mastership says it is more lawful to rob him than to render him faithful  service.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Out with the prating villain!&rdquo; said Beaumanoir, who was not  prepared to refute this practical application of his general maxim.          Higg, the son of Snell, withdrew into the crowd, but, interested in the fate of  his benefactress, lingered until he should learn her doom, even at the risk of  again encountering the frown of that severe judge, the terror of which withered  his very heart within him.          At this period of the trial, the Grand Master commanded Rebecca to unveil  herself. Opening her lips for the first time, she replied patiently, but with  dignity,&mdash;&ldquo;That it was not the wont of the daughters of her people  to uncover their faces when alone in an assembly of strangers.&rdquo; The sweet  tones of her voice, and the softness of her reply, impressed on the audience a  sentiment of pity and sympathy. But Beaumanoir, in whose mind the suppression  of each feeling of humanity which could interfere with his imagined duty, was a  virtue of itself, repeated his commands that his victim should be unveiled. The  guards were about to remove her veil accordingly, when she stood up before the  Grand Master and said, &ldquo;Nay, but for the love of your own  daughters&mdash;Alas,&rdquo; she said, recollecting herself, &ldquo;ye have no  daughters!&mdash;yet for the remembrance of your mothers&mdash;for the love of  your sisters, and of female decency, let me not be thus handled in your  presence; it suits not a maiden to be disrobed by such rude grooms. I will obey  you,&rdquo; she added, with an expression of patient sorrow in her voice, which  had almost melted the heart of Beaumanoir himself; &ldquo;ye are elders among  your people, and at your command I will show the features of an ill-fated  maiden.&rdquo;          She withdrew her veil, and looked on them with a countenance in which  bashfulness contended with dignity. Her exceeding beauty excited a murmur of  surprise, and the younger knights told each other with their eyes, in silent  correspondence, that Brian&rsquo;s best apology was in the power of her real  charms, rather than of her imaginary witchcraft. But Higg, the son of Snell,  felt most deeply the effect produced by the sight of the countenance of his  benefactress.          &ldquo;Let me go forth,&rdquo; he said to the warders at the door of the  hall,&mdash;&ldquo;let me go forth!&mdash;To look at her again will kill me,  for I have had a share in murdering her.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Peace, poor man,&rdquo; said Rebecca, when she heard his exclamation;  &ldquo;thou hast done me no harm by speaking the truth&mdash;thou canst not aid  me by thy complaints or lamentations. Peace, I pray thee&mdash;go home and save  thyself.&rdquo;          Higg was about to be thrust out by the compassion of the warders, who were  apprehensive lest his clamorous grief should draw upon them reprehension, and  upon himself punishment. But he promised to be silent, and was permitted to  remain. The two men-at-arms, with whom Albert Malvoisin had not failed to  communicate upon the import of their testimony, were now called forward. Though  both were hardened and inflexible villains, the sight of the captive maiden, as  well as her excelling beauty, at first appeared to stagger them; but an  expressive glance from the Preceptor of Templestowe restored them to their  dogged composure; and they delivered, with a precision which would have seemed  suspicious to more impartial judges, circumstances either altogether fictitious  or trivial, and natural in themselves, but rendered pregnant with suspicion by  the exaggerated manner in which they were told, and the sinister commentary  which the witnesses added to the facts. The circumstances of their evidence  would have been, in modern days, divided into two classes&mdash;those which  were immaterial, and those which were actually and physically impossible. But  both were, in those ignorant and superstitions times, easily credited as proofs  of guilt.&mdash;The first class set forth, that Rebecca was heard to mutter to  herself in an unknown tongue&mdash;that the songs she sung by fits were of a  strangely sweet sound, which made the ears of the hearer tingle, and his heart  throb&mdash;that she spoke at times to herself, and seemed to look upward for a  reply&mdash;that her garments were of a strange and mystic form, unlike those  of women of good repute&mdash;that she had rings impressed with cabalistical  devices, and that strange characters were broidered on her veil.          All these circumstances, so natural and so trivial, were gravely listened to as  proofs, or, at least, as affording strong suspicions that Rebecca had unlawful  correspondence with mystical powers.          But there was less equivocal testimony, which the credulity of the assembly, or  of the greater part, greedily swallowed, however incredible. One of the  soldiers had seen her work a cure upon a wounded man, brought with them to the  castle of Torquilstone. She did, he said, make certain signs upon the wound,  and repeated certain mysterious words, which he blessed God he understood not,  when the iron head of a square cross-bow bolt disengaged itself from the wound,  the bleeding was stanched, the wound was closed, and the dying man was, within  a quarter of an hour, walking upon the ramparts, and assisting the witness in  managing a mangonel, or machine for hurling stones. This legend was probably  founded upon the fact, that Rebecca had attended on the wounded Ivanhoe when in  the castle of Torquilstone. But it was the more difficult to dispute the  accuracy of the witness, as, in order to produce real evidence in support of  his verbal testimony, he drew from his pouch the very bolt-head, which,  according to his story, had been miraculously extracted from the wound; and as  the iron weighed a full ounce, it completely confirmed the tale, however  marvellous.          His comrade had been a witness from a neighbouring battlement of the scene  betwixt Rebecca and Bois-Guilbert, when she was upon the point of precipitating  herself from the top of the tower. Not to be behind his companion, this fellow  stated, that he had seen Rebecca perch herself upon the parapet of the turret,  and there take the form of a milk-white swan, under which appearance she  flitted three times round the castle of Torquilstone; then again settle on the  turret, and once more assume the female form.          Less than one half of this weighty evidence would have been sufficient to  convict any old woman, poor and ugly, even though she had not been a Jewess.  United with that fatal circumstance, the body of proof was too weighty for  Rebecca&rsquo;s youth, though combined with the most exquisite beauty.          The Grand Master had collected the suffrages, and now in a solemn tone demanded  of Rebecca what she had to say against the sentence of condemnation, which he  was about to pronounce.          &ldquo;To invoke your pity,&rdquo; said the lovely Jewess, with a voice  somewhat tremulous with emotion, &ldquo;would, I am aware, be as useless as I  should hold it mean. To state that to relieve the sick and wounded of another  religion, cannot be displeasing to the acknowledged Founder of both our faiths,  were also unavailing; to plead that many things which these men (whom may  Heaven pardon!) have spoken against me are impossible, would avail me but  little, since you believe in their possibility; and still less would it  advantage me to explain, that the peculiarities of my dress, language, and  manners, are those of my people&mdash;I had well-nigh said of my country, but  alas! we have no country. Nor will I even vindicate myself at the expense of my  oppressor, who stands there listening to the fictions and surmises which seem  to convert the tyrant into the victim.&mdash;God be judge between him and me!  but rather would I submit to ten such deaths as your pleasure may denounce  against me, than listen to the suit which that man of Belial has urged upon  me&mdash;friendless, defenceless, and his prisoner. But he is of your own  faith, and his lightest affirmance would weigh down the most solemn  protestations of the distressed Jewess. I will not therefore return to himself  the charge brought against me&mdash;but to himself&mdash;Yes, Brian de  Bois-Guilbert, to thyself I appeal, whether these accusations are not false? as  monstrous and calumnious as they are deadly?&rdquo;          There was a pause; all eyes turned to Brain de Bois-Guilbert. He was silent.          &ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if thou art a man&mdash;if thou art a  Christian, speak!&mdash;I conjure thee, by the habit which thou dost wear, by  the name thou dost inherit&mdash;by the knighthood thou dost vaunt&mdash;by the  honour of thy mother&mdash;by the tomb and the bones of thy father&mdash;I  conjure thee to say, are these things true?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Answer her, brother,&rdquo; said the Grand Master, &ldquo;if the Enemy  with whom thou dost wrestle will give thee power.&rdquo;          In fact, Bois-Guilbert seemed agitated by contending passions, which almost  convulsed his features, and it was with a constrained voice that at last he  replied, looking to Rebecca,&mdash;&ldquo;The scroll!&mdash;the scroll!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Beaumanoir, &ldquo;this is indeed testimony! The victim  of her witcheries can only name the fatal scroll, the spell inscribed on which  is, doubtless, the cause of his silence.&rdquo;          But Rebecca put another interpretation on the words extorted as it were from  Bois-Guilbert, and glancing her eye upon the slip of parchment which she  continued to hold in her hand, she read written thereupon in the Arabian  character, &ldquo;Demand a Champion!&rdquo; The murmuring commentary which ran  through the assembly at the strange reply of Bois-Guilbert, gave Rebecca  leisure to examine and instantly to destroy the scroll unobserved. When the  whisper had ceased, the Grand Master spoke.          &ldquo;Rebecca, thou canst derive no benefit from the evidence of this unhappy  knight, for whom, as we well perceive, the Enemy is yet too powerful. Hast thou  aught else to say?&rdquo;          &ldquo;There is yet one chance of life left to me,&rdquo; said Rebecca,  &ldquo;even by your own fierce laws. Life has been miserable&mdash;miserable,  at least, of late&mdash;but I will not cast away the gift of God, while he  affords me the means of defending it. I deny this charge&mdash;I maintain my  innocence, and I declare the falsehood of this accusation&mdash;I challenge the  privilege of trial by combat, and will appear by my champion.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And who, Rebecca,&rdquo; replied the Grand Master, &ldquo;will lay lance  in rest for a sorceress? who will be the champion of a Jewess?&rdquo;          &ldquo;God will raise me up a champion,&rdquo; said Rebecca&mdash;&ldquo;It  cannot be that in merry England&mdash;the hospitable, the generous, the free,  where so many are ready to peril their lives for honour, there will not be  found one to fight for justice. But it is enough that I challenge the trial by  combat&mdash;there lies my gage.&rdquo;          She took her embroidered glove from her hand, and flung it down before the  Grand Master with an air of mingled simplicity and dignity, which excited  universal surprise and admiration.                     CHAPTER XXXVIII        &mdash;There I throw my gage,   To prove it on thee to the extremest point   Of martial daring.          R ICHARD  II          Even Lucas Beaumanoir himself was affected by the mien and appearance of  Rebecca. He was not originally a cruel or even a severe man; but with passions  by nature cold, and with a high, though mistaken, sense of duty, his heart had  been gradually hardened by the ascetic life which he pursued, the supreme power  which he enjoyed, and the supposed necessity of subduing infidelity and  eradicating heresy, which he conceived peculiarly incumbent on him. His  features relaxed in their usual severity as he gazed upon the beautiful  creature before him, alone, unfriended, and defending herself with so much  spirit and courage. He crossed himself twice, as doubting whence arose the  unwonted softening of a heart, which on such occasions used to resemble in  hardness the steel of his sword. At length he spoke.          &ldquo;Damsel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if the pity I feel for thee arise from  any practice thine evil arts have made on me, great is thy guilt. But I rather  judge it the kinder feelings of nature, which grieves that so goodly a form  should be a vessel of perdition. Repent, my daughter&mdash;confess thy  witchcrafts&mdash;turn thee from thine evil faith&mdash;embrace this holy  emblem, and all shall yet be well with thee here and hereafter. In some  sisterhood of the strictest order, shalt thou have time for prayer and fitting  penance, and that repentance not to be repented of. This do and live&mdash;what  has the law of Moses done for thee that thou shouldest die for it?&rdquo;          &ldquo;It was the law of my fathers,&rdquo; said Rebecca; &ldquo;it was  delivered in thunders and in storms upon the mountain of Sinai, in cloud and in  fire. This, if ye are Christians, ye believe&mdash;it is, you say, recalled;  but so my teachers have not taught me.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Let our chaplain,&rdquo; said Beaumanoir, &ldquo;stand forth, and tell  this obstinate infidel&mdash;&rdquo;          &ldquo;Forgive the interruption,&rdquo; said Rebecca, meekly; &ldquo;I am a  maiden, unskilled to dispute for my religion, but I can die for it, if it be  God&rsquo;s will.&mdash;Let me pray your answer to my demand of a  champion.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Give me her glove,&rdquo; said Beaumanoir. &ldquo;This is indeed,&rdquo;  he continued, as he looked at the flimsy texture and slender fingers, &ldquo;a  slight and frail gage for a purpose so deadly!&mdash;Seest thou, Rebecca, as  this thin and light glove of thine is to one of our heavy steel gauntlets, so  is thy cause to that of the Temple, for it is our Order which thou hast  defied.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Cast my innocence into the scale,&rdquo; answered Rebecca, &ldquo;and  the glove of silk shall outweigh the glove of iron.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Then thou dost persist in thy refusal to confess thy guilt, and in that  bold challenge which thou hast made?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I do persist, noble sir,&rdquo; answered Rebecca.          &ldquo;So be it then, in the name of Heaven,&rdquo; said the Grand Master;  &ldquo;and may God show the right!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; replied the Preceptors around him, and the word was deeply  echoed by the whole assembly.          &ldquo;Brethren,&rdquo; said Beaumanoir, &ldquo;you are aware that we might  well have refused to this woman the benefit of the trial by combat&mdash;but  though a Jewess and an unbeliever, she is also a stranger and defenceless, and  God forbid that she should ask the benefit of our mild laws, and that it should  be refused to her. Moreover, we are knights and soldiers as well as men of  religion, and shame it were to us upon any pretence, to refuse proffered  combat. Thus, therefore, stands the case. Rebecca, the daughter of Isaac of  York, is, by many frequent and suspicious circumstances, defamed of sorcery  practised on the person of a noble knight of our holy Order, and hath  challenged the combat in proof of her innocence. To whom, reverend brethren, is  it your opinion that we should deliver the gage of battle, naming him, at the  same time, to be our champion on the field?&rdquo;          &ldquo;To Brian de Bois-Guilbert, whom it chiefly concerns,&rdquo; said the  Preceptor of Goodalricke, &ldquo;and who, moreover, best knows how the truth  stands in this matter.&rdquo;          &ldquo;But if,&rdquo; said the Grand Master, &ldquo;our brother Brian be under  the influence of a charm or a spell&mdash;we speak but for the sake of  precaution, for to the arm of none of our holy Order would we more willingly  confide this or a more weighty cause.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Reverend father,&rdquo; answered the Preceptor of Goodalricke, &ldquo;no  spell can effect the champion who comes forward to fight for the judgment of  God.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou sayest right, brother,&rdquo; said the Grand Master. &ldquo;Albert  Malvoisin, give this gage of battle to Brian de Bois-Guilbert.&mdash;It is our  charge to thee, brother,&rdquo; he continued, addressing himself to  Bois-Guilbert, &ldquo;that thou do thy battle manfully, nothing doubting that  the good cause shall triumph.&mdash;And do thou, Rebecca, attend, that we  assign thee the third day from the present to find a champion.&rdquo;          &ldquo;That is but brief space,&rdquo; answered Rebecca, &ldquo;for a stranger,  who is also of another faith, to find one who will do battle, wagering life and  honour for her cause, against a knight who is called an approved  soldier.&rdquo;          &ldquo;We may not extend it,&rdquo; answered the Grand Master; &ldquo;the field  must be foughten in our own presence, and divers weighty causes call us on the  fourth day from hence.&rdquo;          &ldquo;God&rsquo;s will be done!&rdquo; said Rebecca; &ldquo;I put my trust in  Him, to whom an instant is as effectual to save as a whole age.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou hast spoken well, damsel,&rdquo; said the Grand Master; &ldquo;but  well know we who can array himself like an angel of light. It remains but to  name a fitting place of combat, and, if it so hap, also of  execution.&mdash;Where is the Preceptor of this house?&rdquo;          Albert Malvoisin, still holding Rebecca&rsquo;s glove in his hand, was speaking  to Bois-Guilbert very earnestly, but in a low voice.          &ldquo;How!&rdquo; said the Grand Master, &ldquo;will he not receive the  gage?&rdquo;          &ldquo;He will&mdash;he doth, most Reverend Father,&rdquo; said Malvoisin,  slipping the glove under his own mantle. &ldquo;And for the place of combat, I  hold the fittest to be the lists of Saint George belonging to this Preceptory,  and used by us for military exercise.&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said the Grand Master.&mdash;&ldquo;Rebecca, in those  lists shalt thou produce thy champion; and if thou failest to do so, or if thy  champion shall be discomfited by the judgment of God, thou shalt then die the  death of a sorceress, according to doom.&mdash;Let this our judgment be  recorded, and the record read aloud, that no one may pretend ignorance.&rdquo;          One of the chaplains, who acted as clerks to the chapter, immediately engrossed  the order in a huge volume, which contained the proceedings of the Templar  Knights when solemnly assembled on such occasions; and when he had finished  writing, the other read aloud the sentence of the Grand Master, which, when  translated from the Norman-French in which it was couched, was expressed as  follows.&mdash;          &ldquo;Rebecca, a Jewess, daughter of Isaac of York, being attainted of  sorcery, seduction, and other damnable practices, practised on a Knight of the  most Holy Order of the Temple of Zion, doth deny the same; and saith, that the  testimony delivered against her this day is false, wicked, and disloyal; and  that by lawful &lsquo;essoine&rsquo;   54   of her body as  being unable to combat in her own behalf, she doth offer, by a champion instead  thereof, to avouch her case, he performing his loyal &lsquo;devoir&rsquo; in  all knightly sort, with such arms as to gage of battle do fully appertain, and  that at her peril and cost. And therewith she proffered her gage. And the gage  having been delivered to the noble Lord and Knight, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, of  the Holy Order of the Temple of Zion, he was appointed to do this battle, in  behalf of his Order and himself, as injured and impaired by the practices of  the appellant. Wherefore the most reverend Father and puissant Lord, Lucas  Marquis of Beaumanoir, did allow of the said challenge, and of the said  &lsquo;essoine&rsquo; of the appellant&rsquo;s body, and assigned the third day  for the said combat, the place being the enclosure called the lists of Saint  George, near to the Preceptory of Templestowe. And the Grand Master appoints  the appellant to appear there by her champion, on pain of doom, as a person  convicted of sorcery or seduction; and also the defendant so to appear, under  the penalty of being held and adjudged recreant in case of default; and the  noble Lord and most reverend Father aforesaid appointed the battle to be done  in his own presence, and according to all that is commendable and profitable in  such a case. And may God aid the just cause!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; said the Grand Master; and the word was echoed by all  around. Rebecca spoke not, but she looked up to heaven, and, folding her hands,  remained for a minute without change of attitude. She then modestly reminded  the Grand Master, that she ought to be permitted some opportunity of free  communication with her friends, for the purpose of making her condition known  to them, and procuring, if possible, some champion to fight in her behalf.          &ldquo;It is just and lawful,&rdquo; said the Grand Master; &ldquo;choose what  messenger thou shalt trust, and he shall have free communication with thee in  thy prison-chamber.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Is there,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;any one here, who, either for love  of a good cause, or for ample hire, will do the errand of a distressed  being?&rdquo;          All were silent; for none thought it safe, in the presence of the Grand Master,  to avow any interest in the calumniated prisoner, lest he should be suspected  of leaning towards Judaism. Not even the prospect of reward, far less any  feelings of compassion alone, could surmount this apprehension.          Rebecca stood for a few moments in indescribable anxiety, and then exclaimed,  &ldquo;Is it really thus?&mdash;And, in English land, am I to be deprived of  the poor chance of safety which remains to me, for want of an act of charity  which would not be refused to the worst criminal?&rdquo;          Higg, the son of Snell, at length replied, &ldquo;I am but a maimed man, but  that I can at all stir or move was owing to her charitable assistance.&mdash;I  will do thine errand,&rdquo; he added, addressing Rebecca, &ldquo;as well as a  crippled object can, and happy were my limbs fleet enough to repair the  mischief done by my tongue. Alas! when I boasted of thy charity, I little  thought I was leading thee into danger!&rdquo;          &ldquo;God,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;is the disposer of all. He can turn  back the captivity of Judah, even by the weakest instrument. To execute his  message the snail is as sure a messenger as the falcon. Seek out Isaac of  York&mdash;here is that will pay for horse and man&mdash;let him have this  scroll.&mdash;I know not if it be of Heaven the spirit which inspires me, but  most truly do I judge that I am not to die this death, and that a champion will  be raised up for me. Farewell!&mdash;Life and death are in thy haste.&rdquo;          The peasant took the scroll, which contained only a few lines in Hebrew. Many  of the crowd would have dissuaded him from touching a document so suspicious;  but Higg was resolute in the service of his benefactress. She had saved his  body, he said, and he was confident she did not mean to peril his soul.          &ldquo;I will get me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my neighbour Buthan&rsquo;s good  capul,   55   and I will be at York within as brief  space as man and beast may.&rdquo;          But as it fortuned, he had no occasion to go so far, for within a quarter of a  mile from the gate of the Preceptory he met with two riders, whom, by their  dress and their huge yellow caps, he knew to be Jews; and, on approaching more  nearly, discovered that one of them was his ancient employer, Isaac of York.  The other was the Rabbi Ben Samuel; and both had approached as near to the  Preceptory as they dared, on hearing that the Grand Master had summoned a  chapter for the trial of a sorceress.          &ldquo;Brother Ben Samuel,&rdquo; said Isaac, &ldquo;my soul is disquieted, and  I wot not why. This charge of necromancy is right often used for cloaking evil  practices on our people.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Be of good comfort, brother,&rdquo; said the physician; &ldquo;thou  canst deal with the Nazarenes as one possessing the mammon of unrighteousness,  and canst therefore purchase immunity at their hands&mdash;it rules the savage  minds of those ungodly men, even as the signet of the mighty Solomon was said  to command the evil genii.&mdash;But what poor wretch comes hither upon his  crutches, desiring, as I think, some speech of me?&mdash;Friend,&rdquo;  continued the physician, addressing Higg, the son of Snell, &ldquo;I refuse  thee not the aid of mine art, but I relieve not with one asper those who beg  for alms upon the highway. Out upon thee!&mdash;Hast thou the palsy in thy  legs? then let thy hands work for thy livelihood; for, albeit thou be&rsquo;st  unfit for a speedy post, or for a careful shepherd, or for the warfare, or for  the service of a hasty master, yet there be occupations&mdash;How now,  brother?&rdquo; said he, interrupting his harangue to look towards Isaac, who  had but glanced at the scroll which Higg offered, when, uttering a deep groan,  he fell from his mule like a dying man, and lay for a minute insensible.          The Rabbi now dismounted in great alarm, and hastily applied the remedies which  his art suggested for the recovery of his companion. He had even taken from his  pocket a cupping apparatus, and was about to proceed to phlebotomy, when the  object of his anxious solicitude suddenly revived; but it was to dash his cap  from his head, and to throw dust on his grey hairs. The physician was at first  inclined to ascribe this sudden and violent emotion to the effects of insanity;  and, adhering to his original purpose, began once again to handle his  implements. But Isaac soon convinced him of his error.          &ldquo;Child of my sorrow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;well shouldst thou be called  Benoni, instead of Rebecca! Why should thy death bring down my grey hairs to  the grave, till, in the bitterness of my heart, I curse God and die!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said the Rabbi, in great surprise, &ldquo;art thou a  father in Israel, and dost thou utter words like unto these?&mdash;I trust that  the child of thy house yet liveth?&rdquo;          &ldquo;She liveth,&rdquo; answered Isaac; &ldquo;but it is as Daniel, who was  called Beltheshazzar, even when within the den of the lions. She is captive  unto those men of Belial, and they will wreak their cruelty upon her, sparing  neither for her youth nor her comely favour. O! she was as a crown of green  palms to my grey locks; and she must wither in a night, like the gourd of  Jonah!&mdash;Child of my love!&mdash;child of my old age!&mdash;oh, Rebecca,  daughter of Rachel! the darkness of the shadow of death hath encompassed  thee.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Yet read the scroll,&rdquo; said the Rabbi; &ldquo;peradventure it may  be that we may yet find out a way of deliverance.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Do thou read, brother,&rdquo; answered Isaac, &ldquo;for mine eyes are  as a fountain of water.&rdquo;          The physician read, but in their native language, the following words:&mdash;          &ldquo;To Isaac, the son of Adonikam, whom the Gentiles call Isaac of York,  peace and the blessing of the promise be multiplied unto thee!&mdash;My father,  I am as one doomed to die for that which my soul knoweth not&mdash;even for the  crime of witchcraft. My father, if a strong man can be found to do battle for  my cause with sword and spear, according to the custom of the Nazarenes, and  that within the lists of Templestowe, on the third day from this time,  peradventure our fathers&rsquo; God will give him strength to defend the  innocent, and her who hath none to help her. But if this may not be, let the  virgins of our people mourn for me as for one cast off, and for the hart that  is stricken by the hunter, and for the flower which is cut down by the scythe  of the mower. Wherefore look now what thou doest, and whether there be any  rescue. One Nazarene warrior might indeed bear arms in my behalf, even Wilfred,  son of Cedric, whom the Gentiles call Ivanhoe. But he may not yet endure the  weight of his armour. Nevertheless, send the tidings unto him, my father; for  he hath favour among the strong men of his people, and as he was our companion  in the house of bondage, he may find some one to do battle for my sake. And say  unto him, even unto him, even unto Wilfred, the son of Cedric, that if Rebecca  live, or if Rebecca die, she liveth or dieth wholly free of the guilt she is  charged withal. And if it be the will of God that thou shalt be deprived of thy  daughter, do not thou tarry, old man, in this land of bloodshed and cruelty;  but betake thyself to Cordova, where thy brother liveth in safety, under the  shadow of the throne, even of the throne of Boabdil the Saracen; for less cruel  are the cruelties of the Moors unto the race of Jacob, than the cruelties of  the Nazarenes of England.&rdquo;          Isaac listened with tolerable composure while Ben Samuel read the letter, and  then again resumed the gestures and exclamations of Oriental sorrow, tearing  his garments, besprinkling his head with dust, and ejaculating, &ldquo;My  daughter! my daughter! flesh of my flesh, and bone of my bone!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; said the Rabbi, &ldquo;take courage, for this grief availeth  nothing. Gird up thy loins, and seek out this Wilfred, the son of Cedric. It  may be he will help thee with counsel or with strength; for the youth hath  favour in the eyes of Richard, called of the Nazarenes Cœur-de-Lion, and the  tidings that he hath returned are constant in the land. It may be that he may  obtain his letter, and his signet, commanding these men of blood, who take  their name from the Temple to the dishonour thereof, that they proceed not in  their purposed wickedness.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I will seek him out,&rdquo; said Isaac, &ldquo;for he is a good youth,  and hath compassion for the exile of Jacob. But he cannot bear his armour, and  what other Christian shall do battle for the oppressed of Zion?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay, but,&rdquo; said the Rabbi, &ldquo;thou speakest as one that  knoweth not the Gentiles. With gold shalt thou buy their valour, even as with  gold thou buyest thine own safety. Be of good courage, and do thou set forward  to find out this Wilfred of Ivanhoe. I will also up and be doing, for great sin  it were to leave thee in thy calamity. I will hie me to the city of York, where  many warriors and strong men are assembled, and doubt not I will find among  them some one who will do battle for thy daughter; for gold is their god, and  for riches will they pawn their lives as well as their lands.&mdash;Thou wilt  fulfil, my brother, such promise as I may make unto them in thy name?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Assuredly, brother,&rdquo; said Isaac, &ldquo;and Heaven be praised that  raised me up a comforter in my misery. Howbeit, grant them not their full  demand at once, for thou shalt find it the quality of this accursed people that  they will ask pounds, and peradventure accept of ounces&mdash;Nevertheless, be  it as thou willest, for I am distracted in this thing, and what would my gold  avail me if the child of my love should perish!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Farewell,&rdquo; said the physician, &ldquo;and may it be to thee as thy  heart desireth.&rdquo;          They embraced accordingly, and departed on their several roads. The crippled  peasant remained for some time looking after them.          &ldquo;These dog-Jews!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;to take no more notice of a free  guild-brother, than if I were a bond slave or a Turk, or a circumcised Hebrew  like themselves! They might have flung me a mancus or two, however. I was not  obliged to bring their unhallowed scrawls, and run the risk of being bewitched,  as more folks than one told me. And what care I for the bit of gold that the  wench gave me, if I am to come to harm from the priest next Easter at  confession, and be obliged to give him twice as much to make it up with him,  and be called the Jew&rsquo;s flying post all my life, as it may hap, into the  bargain? I think I was bewitched in earnest when I was beside that  girl!&mdash;But it was always so with Jew or Gentile, whosoever came near  her&mdash;none could stay when she had an errand to go&mdash;and still,  whenever I think of her, I would give shop and tools to save her life.&rdquo;                     CHAPTER XXXIX        O maid, unrelenting and cold as thou art,   My bosom is proud as thine own.          S EWARD           It was in the twilight of the day when her trial, if it could be called such,  had taken place, that a low knock was heard at the door of Rebecca&rsquo;s  prison-chamber. It disturbed not the inmate, who was then engaged in the  evening prayer recommended by her religion, and which concluded with a hymn we  have ventured thus to translate into English.          When Israel, of the Lord beloved,       Out of the land of bondage came,   Her father&rsquo;s God before her moved,       An awful guide, in smoke and flame.   By day, along the astonish&rsquo;d lands       The cloudy pillar glided slow;   By night, Arabia&rsquo;s crimson&rsquo;d sands       Return&rsquo;d the fiery column&rsquo;s glow.      There rose the choral hymn of praise,       And trump and timbrel answer&rsquo;d keen,   And Zion&rsquo;s daughters pour&rsquo;d their lays,       With priest&rsquo;s and warrior&rsquo;s voice between.   No portents now our foes amaze,       Forsaken Israel wanders lone;   Our fathers would not know THY ways,       And THOU hast left them to their own.      But, present still, though now unseen;       When brightly shines the prosperous day,   Be thoughts of THEE a cloudy screen       To temper the deceitful ray.   And oh, when stoops on Judah&rsquo;s path       In shade and storm the frequent night,   Be THOU, long-suffering, slow to wrath,       A burning, and a shining light!      Our harps we left by Babel&rsquo;s streams,       The tyrant&rsquo;s jest, the Gentile&rsquo;s scorn;   No censer round our altar beams,       And mute our timbrel, trump, and horn.   But THOU hast said, the blood of goat,       The flesh of rams, I will not prize;   A contrite heart, and humble thought,       Are mine accepted sacrifice.          When the sounds of Rebecca&rsquo;s devotional hymn had died away in silence,  the low knock at the door was again renewed. &ldquo;Enter,&rdquo; she said,  &ldquo;if thou art a friend; and if a foe, I have not the means of refusing thy  entrance.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Brian de Bois-Guilbert, entering the apartment,  &ldquo;friend or foe, Rebecca, as the event of this interview shall make  me.&rdquo;          Alarmed at the sight of this man, whose licentious passion she considered as  the root of her misfortunes, Rebecca drew backward with a cautious and alarmed,  yet not a timorous demeanour, into the farthest corner of the apartment, as if  determined to retreat as far as she could, but to stand her ground when retreat  became no longer possible. She drew herself into an attitude not of defiance,  but of resolution, as one that would avoid provoking assault, yet was resolute  to repel it, being offered, to the utmost of her power.          &ldquo;You have no reason to fear me, Rebecca,&rdquo; said the Templar;  &ldquo;or if I must so qualify my speech, you have at least NOW no reason to  fear me.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I fear you not, Sir Knight,&rdquo; replied Rebecca, although her  short-drawn breath seemed to belie the heroism of her accents; &ldquo;my trust  is strong, and I fear thee not.&rdquo;          &ldquo;You have no cause,&rdquo; answered Bois-Guilbert, gravely; &ldquo;my  former frantic attempts you have not now to dread. Within your call are guards,  over whom I have no authority. They are designed to conduct you to death,  Rebecca, yet would not suffer you to be insulted by any one, even by me, were  my frenzy&mdash;for frenzy it is&mdash;to urge me so far.&rdquo;          &ldquo;May Heaven be praised!&rdquo; said the Jewess; &ldquo;death is the least  of my apprehensions in this den of evil.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; replied the Templar, &ldquo;the idea of death is easily  received by the courageous mind, when the road to it is sudden and open. A  thrust with a lance, a stroke with a sword, were to me little&mdash;To you, a  spring from a dizzy battlement, a stroke with a sharp poniard, has no terrors,  compared with what either thinks disgrace. Mark me&mdash;I say  this&mdash;perhaps mine own sentiments of honour are not less fantastic,  Rebecca, than thine are; but we know alike how to die for them.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Unhappy man,&rdquo; said the Jewess; &ldquo;and art thou condemned to  expose thy life for principles, of which thy sober judgment does not  acknowledge the solidity? Surely this is a parting with your treasure for that  which is not bread&mdash;but deem not so of me. Thy resolution may fluctuate on  the wild and changeful billows of human opinion, but mine is anchored on the  Rock of Ages.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Silence, maiden,&rdquo; answered the Templar; &ldquo;such discourse now  avails but little. Thou art condemned to die not a sudden and easy death, such  as misery chooses, and despair welcomes, but a slow, wretched, protracted  course of torture, suited to what the diabolical bigotry of these men calls thy  crime.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And to whom&mdash;if such my fate&mdash;to whom do I owe this?&rdquo;  said Rebecca &ldquo;surely only to him, who, for a most selfish and brutal  cause, dragged me hither, and who now, for some unknown purpose of his own,  strives to exaggerate the wretched fate to which he exposed me.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Think not,&rdquo; said the Templar, &ldquo;that I have so exposed thee;  I would have bucklered thee against such danger with my own bosom, as freely as  ever I exposed it to the shafts which had otherwise reached thy life.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Had thy purpose been the honourable protection of the innocent,&rdquo;  said Rebecca, &ldquo;I had thanked thee for thy care&mdash;as it is, thou hast  claimed merit for it so often, that I tell thee life is worth nothing to me,  preserved at the price which thou wouldst exact for it.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Truce with thine upbraidings, Rebecca,&rdquo; said the Templar; &ldquo;I  have my own cause of grief, and brook not that thy reproaches should add to  it.&rdquo;          &ldquo;What is thy purpose, then, Sir Knight?&rdquo; said the Jewess;  &ldquo;speak it briefly.&mdash;If thou hast aught to do, save to witness the  misery thou hast caused, let me know it; and then, if so it please you, leave  me to myself&mdash;the step between time and eternity is short but terrible,  and I have few moments to prepare for it.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I perceive, Rebecca,&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert, &ldquo;that thou dost  continue to burden me with the charge of distresses, which most fain would I  have prevented.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Sir Knight,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;I would avoid  reproaches&mdash;But what is more certain than that I owe my death to thine  unbridled passion?&rdquo;          &ldquo;You err&mdash;you err,&rdquo;&mdash;said the Templar, hastily, &ldquo;if  you impute what I could neither foresee nor prevent to my purpose or  agency.&mdash;Could I guess the unexpected arrival of yon dotard, whom some  flashes of frantic valour, and the praises yielded by fools to the stupid  self-torments of an ascetic, have raised for the present above his own merits,  above common sense, above me, and above the hundreds of our Order, who think  and feel as men free from such silly and fantastic prejudices as are the  grounds of his opinions and actions?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;you sate a judge upon me,  innocent&mdash;most innocent&mdash;as you knew me to be&mdash;you concurred in  my condemnation, and, if I aright understood, are yourself to appear in arms to  assert my guilt, and assure my punishment.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thy patience, maiden,&rdquo; replied the Templar. &ldquo;No race knows  so well as thine own tribes how to submit to the time, and so to trim their  bark as to make advantage even of an adverse wind.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Lamented be the hour,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;that has taught such  art to the House of Israel! but adversity bends the heart as fire bends the  stubborn steel, and those who are no longer their own governors, and the  denizens of their own free independent state, must crouch before strangers. It  is our curse, Sir Knight, deserved, doubtless, by our own misdeeds and those of  our fathers; but you&mdash;you who boast your freedom as your birthright, how  much deeper is your disgrace when you stoop to soothe the prejudices of others,  and that against your own conviction?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Your words are bitter, Rebecca,&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert, pacing the  apartment with impatience, &ldquo;but I came not hither to bandy reproaches  with you.&mdash;Know that Bois-Guilbert yields not to created man, although  circumstances may for a time induce him to alter his plan. His will is the  mountain stream, which may indeed be turned for a little space aside by the  rock, but fails not to find its course to the ocean. That scroll which warned  thee to demand a champion, from whom couldst thou think it came, if not from  Bois-Guilbert? In whom else couldst thou have excited such interest?&rdquo;          &ldquo;A brief respite from instant death,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;which  will little avail me&mdash;was this all thou couldst do for one, on whose head  thou hast heaped sorrow, and whom thou hast brought near even to the verge of  the tomb?&rdquo;          &ldquo;No maiden,&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert, &ldquo;this was NOT all that I  purposed. Had it not been for the accursed interference of yon fanatical  dotard, and the fool of Goodalricke, who, being a Templar, affects to think and  judge according to the ordinary rules of humanity, the office of the Champion  Defender had devolved, not on a Preceptor, but on a Companion of the Order.  Then I myself&mdash;such was my purpose&mdash;had, on the sounding of the  trumpet, appeared in the lists as thy champion, disguised indeed in the fashion  of a roving knight, who seeks adventures to prove his shield and spear; and  then, let Beaumanoir have chosen not one, but two or three of the brethren here  assembled, I had not doubted to cast them out of the saddle with my single  lance. Thus, Rebecca, should thine innocence have been avouched, and to thine  own gratitude would I have trusted for the reward of my victory.&rdquo;          &ldquo;This, Sir Knight,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;is but idle  boasting&mdash;a brag of what you would have done had you not found it  convenient to do otherwise. You received my glove, and my champion, if a  creature so desolate can find one, must encounter your lance in the  lists&mdash;yet you would assume the air of my friend and protector!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thy friend and protector,&rdquo; said the Templar, gravely, &ldquo;I  will yet be&mdash;but mark at what risk, or rather at what certainty, of  dishonour; and then blame me not if I make my stipulations, before I offer up  all that I have hitherto held dear, to save the life of a Jewish maiden.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; said Rebecca; &ldquo;I understand thee not.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert, &ldquo;I will speak as freely as  ever did doting penitent to his ghostly father, when placed in the tricky  confessional.&mdash;Rebecca, if I appear not in these lists I lose fame and  rank&mdash;lose that which is the breath of my nostrils, the esteem, I mean, in  which I am held by my brethren, and the hopes I have of succeeding to that  mighty authority, which is now wielded by the bigoted dotard Lucas de  Beaumanoir, but of which I should make a different use. Such is my certain  doom, except I appear in arms against thy cause. Accursed be he of Goodalricke,  who baited this trap for me! and doubly accursed Albert de Malvoisin, who  withheld me from the resolution I had formed, of hurling back the glove at the  face of the superstitious and superannuated fool, who listened to a charge so  absurd, and against a creature so high in mind, and so lovely in form as thou  art!&rdquo;          &ldquo;And what now avails rant or flattery?&rdquo; answered Rebecca.  &ldquo;Thou hast made thy choice between causing to be shed the blood of an  innocent woman, or of endangering thine own earthly state and earthly  hopes&mdash;What avails it to reckon together?&mdash;thy choice is made.&rdquo;          &ldquo;No, Rebecca,&rdquo; said the knight, in a softer tone, and drawing  nearer towards her; &ldquo;my choice is NOT made&mdash;nay, mark, it is thine  to make the election. If I appear in the lists, I must maintain my name in  arms; and if I do so, championed or unchampioned, thou diest by the stake and  faggot, for there lives not the knight who hath coped with me in arms on equal  issue, or on terms of vantage, save Richard Cœur-de-Lion, and his minion of  Ivanhoe. Ivanhoe, as thou well knowest, is unable to bear his corslet, and  Richard is in a foreign prison. If I appear, then thou diest, even although thy  charms should instigate some hot-headed youth to enter the lists in thy  defence.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And what avails repeating this so often?&rdquo; said Rebecca.          &ldquo;Much,&rdquo; replied the Templar; &ldquo;for thou must learn to look at  thy fate on every side.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Well, then, turn the tapestry,&rdquo; said the Jewess, &ldquo;and let me  see the other side.&rdquo;          &ldquo;If I appear,&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert, &ldquo;in the fatal lists, thou  diest by a slow and cruel death, in pain such as they say is destined to the  guilty hereafter. But if I appear not, then am I a degraded and dishonoured  knight, accused of witchcraft and of communion with infidels&mdash;the  illustrious name which has grown yet more so under my wearing, becomes a  hissing and a reproach. I lose fame, I lose honour, I lose the prospect of such  greatness as scarce emperors attain to&mdash;I sacrifice mighty ambition, I  destroy schemes built as high as the mountains with which heathens say their  heaven was once nearly scaled&mdash;and yet, Rebecca,&rdquo; he added, throwing  himself at her feet, &ldquo;this greatness will I sacrifice, this fame will I  renounce, this power will I forego, even now when it is half within my grasp,  if thou wilt say, Bois-Guilbert, I receive thee for my lover.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Think not of such foolishness, Sir Knight,&rdquo; answered Rebecca,  &ldquo;but hasten to the Regent, the Queen Mother, and to Prince  John&mdash;they cannot, in honour to the English crown, allow of the  proceedings of your Grand Master. So shall you give me protection without  sacrifice on your part, or the pretext of requiring any requital from  me.&rdquo;          &ldquo;With these I deal not,&rdquo; he continued, holding the train of her  robe&mdash;&ldquo;it is thee only I address; and what can counterbalance thy  choice? Bethink thee, were I a fiend, yet death is a worse, and it is death who  is my rival.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I weigh not these evils,&rdquo; said Rebecca, afraid to provoke the wild  knight, yet equally determined neither to endure his passion, nor even feign to  endure it. &ldquo;Be a man, be a Christian! If indeed thy faith recommends that  mercy which rather your tongues than your actions pretend, save me from this  dreadful death, without seeking a requital which would change thy magnanimity  into base barter.&rdquo;          &ldquo;No, damsel!&rdquo; said the proud Templar, springing up, &ldquo;thou  shalt not thus impose on me&mdash;if I renounce present fame and future  ambition, I renounce it for thy sake, and we will escape in company. Listen to  me, Rebecca,&rdquo; he said, again softening his tone;  &ldquo;England,&mdash;Europe,&mdash;is not the world. There are spheres in  which we may act, ample enough even for my ambition. We will go to Palestine,  where Conrade, Marquis of Montserrat, is my friend&mdash;a friend free as  myself from the doting scruples which fetter our free-born reason&mdash;rather  with Saladin will we league ourselves, than endure the scorn of the bigots whom  we contemn.&mdash;I will form new paths to greatness,&rdquo; he continued,  again traversing the room with hasty strides&mdash;&ldquo;Europe shall hear the  loud step of him she has driven from her sons!&mdash;Not the millions whom her  crusaders send to slaughter, can do so much to defend Palestine&mdash;not the  sabres of the thousands and ten thousands of Saracens can hew their way so deep  into that land for which nations are striving, as the strength and policy of me  and those brethren, who, in despite of yonder old bigot, will adhere to me in  good and evil. Thou shalt be a queen, Rebecca&mdash;on Mount Carmel shall we  pitch the throne which my valour will gain for you, and I will exchange my  long-desired batoon for a sceptre!&rdquo;          &ldquo;A dream,&rdquo; said Rebecca; &ldquo;an empty vision of the night,  which, were it a waking reality, affects me not. Enough, that the power which  thou mightest acquire, I will never share; nor hold I so light of country or  religious faith, as to esteem him who is willing to barter these ties, and cast  away the bonds of the Order of which he is a sworn member, in order to gratify  an unruly passion for the daughter of another people.&mdash;Put not a price on  my deliverance, Sir Knight&mdash;sell not a deed of generosity&mdash;protect  the oppressed for the sake of charity, and not for a selfish advantage&mdash;Go  to the throne of England; Richard will listen to my appeal from these cruel  men.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Never, Rebecca!&rdquo; said the Templar, fiercely. &ldquo;If I renounce  my Order, for thee alone will I renounce it&mdash;Ambition shall remain mine,  if thou refuse my love; I will not be fooled on all hands.&mdash;Stoop my crest  to Richard?&mdash;ask a boon of that heart of pride?&mdash;Never, Rebecca, will  I place the Order of the Temple at his feet in my person. I may forsake the  Order, I never will degrade or betray it.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Now God be gracious to me,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;for the succour  of man is well-nigh hopeless!&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is indeed,&rdquo; said the Templar; &ldquo;for, proud as thou art,  thou hast in me found thy match. If I enter the lists with my spear in rest,  think not any human consideration shall prevent my putting forth my strength;  and think then upon thine own fate&mdash;to die the dreadful death of the worst  of criminals&mdash;to be consumed upon a blazing pile&mdash;dispersed to the  elements of which our strange forms are so mystically composed&mdash;not a  relic left of that graceful frame, from which we could say this lived and  moved!&mdash;Rebecca, it is not in woman to sustain this prospect&mdash;thou  wilt yield to my suit.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Bois-Guilbert,&rdquo; answered the Jewess, &ldquo;thou knowest not the  heart of woman, or hast only conversed with those who are lost to her best  feelings. I tell thee, proud Templar, that not in thy fiercest battles hast  thou displayed more of thy vaunted courage, than has been shown by woman when  called upon to suffer by affection or duty. I am myself a woman, tenderly  nurtured, naturally fearful of danger, and impatient of pain&mdash;yet, when we  enter those fatal lists, thou to fight and I to suffer, I feel the strong  assurance within me, that my courage shall mount higher than thine.  Farewell&mdash;I waste no more words on thee; the time that remains on earth to  the daughter of Jacob must be otherwise spent&mdash;she must seek the  Comforter, who may hide his face from his people, but who ever opens his ear to  the cry of those who seek him in sincerity and in truth.&rdquo;          &ldquo;We part then thus?&rdquo; said the Templar, after a short pause;  &ldquo;would to Heaven that we had never met, or that thou hadst been noble in  birth and Christian in faith!&mdash;Nay, by Heaven! when I gaze on thee, and  think when and how we are next to meet, I could even wish myself one of thine  own degraded nation; my hand conversant with ingots and shekels, instead of  spear and shield; my head bent down before each petty noble, and my look only  terrible to the shivering and bankrupt debtor&mdash;this could I wish, Rebecca,  to be near to thee in life, and to escape the fearful share I must have in thy  death.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou hast spoken the Jew,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;as the persecution  of such as thou art has made him. Heaven in ire has driven him from his  country, but industry has opened to him the only road to power and to  influence, which oppression has left unbarred. Read the ancient history of the  people of God, and tell me if those, by whom Jehovah wrought such marvels among  the nations, were then a people of misers and of usurers!&mdash;And know, proud  knight, we number names amongst us to which your boasted northern nobility is  as the gourd compared with the cedar&mdash;names that ascend far back to those  high times when the Divine Presence shook the mercy-seat between the cherubim,  and which derive their splendour from no earthly prince, but from the awful  Voice, which bade their fathers be nearest of the congregation to the  Vision&mdash;Such were the princes of the House of Jacob.&rdquo;          Rebecca&rsquo;s colour rose as she boasted the ancient glories of her race, but  faded as she added, with at sigh, &ldquo;Such WERE the princes of Judah, now  such no more!&mdash;They are trampled down like the shorn grass, and mixed with  the mire of the ways. Yet are there those among them who shame not such high  descent, and of such shall be the daughter of Isaac the son of Adonikam!  Farewell!&mdash;I envy not thy blood-won honours&mdash;I envy not thy barbarous  descent from northern heathens&mdash;I envy thee not thy faith, which is ever  in thy mouth, but never in thy heart nor in thy practice.&rdquo;          &ldquo;There is a spell on me, by Heaven!&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert. &ldquo;I  almost think yon besotted skeleton spoke truth, and that the reluctance with  which I part from thee hath something in it more than is natural.&mdash;Fair  creature!&rdquo; he said, approaching near her, but with great  respect,&mdash;&ldquo;so young, so beautiful, so fearless of death! and yet  doomed to die, and with infamy and agony. Who would not weep for  thee?&mdash;The tear, that has been a stranger to these eyelids for twenty  years, moistens them as I gaze on thee. But it must be&mdash;nothing may now  save thy life. Thou and I are but the blind instruments of some irresistible  fatality, that hurries us along, like goodly vessels driving before the storm,  which are dashed against each other, and so perish. Forgive me, then, and let  us part, at least, as friends part. I have assailed thy resolution in vain, and  mine own is fixed as the adamantine decrees of fate.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thus,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;do men throw on fate the issue of  their own wild passions. But I do forgive thee, Bois-Guilbert, though the  author of my early death. There are noble things which cross over thy powerful  mind; but it is the garden of the sluggard, and the weeds have rushed up, and  conspired to choke the fair and wholesome blossom.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Templar, &ldquo;I am, Rebecca, as thou hast spoken  me, untaught, untamed&mdash;and proud, that, amidst a shoal of empty fools and  crafty bigots, I have retained the preeminent fortitude that places me above  them. I have been a child of battle from my youth upward, high in my views,  steady and inflexible in pursuing them. Such must I remain&mdash;proud,  inflexible, and unchanging; and of this the world shall have proof.&mdash;But  thou forgivest me, Rebecca?&rdquo;          &ldquo;As freely as ever victim forgave her executioner.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Farewell, then,&rdquo; said the Templar, and left the apartment.          The Preceptor Albert waited impatiently in an adjacent chamber the return of  Bois-Guilbert.          &ldquo;Thou hast tarried long,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I have been as if  stretched on red-hot iron with very impatience. What if the Grand Master, or  his spy Conrade, had come hither? I had paid dear for my  complaisance.&mdash;But what ails thee, brother?&mdash;Thy step totters, thy  brow is as black as night. Art thou well, Bois-Guilbert?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; answered the Templar, &ldquo;as well as the wretch who is  doomed to die within an hour.&mdash;Nay, by the rood, not half so  well&mdash;for there be those in such state, who can lay down life like a  cast-off garment. By Heaven, Malvoisin, yonder girl hath well-nigh unmanned me.  I am half resolved to go to the Grand Master, abjure the Order to his very  teeth, and refuse to act the brutality which his tyranny has imposed on  me.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou art mad,&rdquo; answered Malvoisin; &ldquo;thou mayst thus indeed  utterly ruin thyself, but canst not even find a chance thereby to save the life  of this Jewess, which seems so precious in thine eyes. Beaumanoir will name  another of the Order to defend his judgment in thy place, and the accused will  as assuredly perish as if thou hadst taken the duty imposed on thee.&rdquo;          &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis false&mdash;I will myself take arms in her behalf,&rdquo;  answered the Templar, haughtily; &ldquo;and, should I do so, I think,  Malvoisin, that thou knowest not one of the Order, who will keep his saddle  before the point of my lance.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay, but thou forgettest,&rdquo; said the wily adviser, &ldquo;thou wilt  have neither leisure nor opportunity to execute this mad project. Go to Lucas  Beaumanoir, and say thou hast renounced thy vow of obedience, and see how long  the despotic old man will leave thee in personal freedom. The words shall  scarce have left thy lips, ere thou wilt either be an hundred feet under  ground, in the dungeon of the Preceptory, to abide trial as a recreant knight;  or, if his opinion holds concerning thy possession, thou wilt be enjoying  straw, darkness, and chains, in some distant convent cell, stunned with  exorcisms, and drenched with holy water, to expel the foul fiend which hath  obtained dominion over thee. Thou must to the lists, Brian, or thou art a lost  and dishonoured man.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I will break forth and fly,&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert&mdash;&ldquo;fly  to some distant land, to which folly and fanaticism have not yet found their  way. No drop of the blood of this most excellent creature shall be spilled by  my sanction.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou canst not fly,&rdquo; said the Preceptor; &ldquo;thy ravings have  excited suspicion, and thou wilt not be permitted to leave the Preceptory. Go  and make the essay&mdash;present thyself before the gate, and command the  bridge to be lowered, and mark what answer thou shalt receive.&mdash;Thou are  surprised and offended; but is it not the better for thee? Wert thou to fly,  what would ensue but the reversal of thy arms, the dishonour of thine ancestry,  the degradation of thy rank?&mdash;Think on it. Where shall thine old  companions in arms hide their heads when Brian de Bois-Guilbert, the best lance  of the Templars, is proclaimed recreant, amid the hisses of the assembled  people? What grief will be at the Court of France! With what joy will the  haughty Richard hear the news, that the knight that set him hard in Palestine,  and well-nigh darkened his renown, has lost fame and honour for a Jewish girl,  whom he could not even save by so costly a sacrifice!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Malvoisin,&rdquo; said the Knight, &ldquo;I thank thee&mdash;thou hast  touched the string at which my heart most readily thrills!&mdash;Come of it  what may, recreant shall never be added to the name of Bois-Guilbert. Would to  God, Richard, or any of his vaunting minions of England, would appear in these  lists! But they will be empty&mdash;no one will risk to break a lance for the  innocent, the forlorn.&rdquo;          &ldquo;The better for thee, if it prove so,&rdquo; said the Preceptor;  &ldquo;if no champion appears, it is not by thy means that this unlucky damsel  shall die, but by the doom of the Grand Master, with whom rests all the blame,  and who will count that blame for praise and commendation.&rdquo;          &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert; &ldquo;if no champion appears, I am but  a part of the pageant, sitting indeed on horseback in the lists, but having no  part in what is to follow.&rdquo;          &ldquo;None whatever,&rdquo; said Malvoisin; &ldquo;no more than the armed  image of Saint George when it makes part of a procession.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Well, I will resume my resolution,&rdquo; replied the haughty Templar.  &ldquo;She has despised me&mdash;repulsed me&mdash;reviled me&mdash;And  wherefore should I offer up for her whatever of estimation I have in the  opinion of others? Malvoisin, I will appear in the lists.&rdquo;          He left the apartment hastily as he uttered these words, and the Preceptor  followed, to watch and confirm him in his resolution; for in  Bois-Guilbert&rsquo;s fame he had himself a strong interest, expecting much  advantage from his being one day at the head of the Order, not to mention the  preferment of which Mont-Fitchet had given him hopes, on condition he would  forward the condemnation of the unfortunate Rebecca. Yet although, in combating  his friend&rsquo;s better feelings, he possessed all the advantage which a  wily, composed, selfish disposition has over a man agitated by strong and  contending passions, it required all Malvoisin&rsquo;s art to keep  Bois-Guilbert steady to the purpose he had prevailed on him to adopt. He was  obliged to watch him closely to prevent his resuming his purpose of flight, to  intercept his communication with the Grand Master, lest he should come to an  open rupture with his Superior, and to renew, from time to time, the various  arguments by which he endeavoured to show, that, in appearing as champion on  this occasion, Bois-Guilbert, without either accelerating or ensuring the fate  of Rebecca, would follow the only course by which he could save himself from  degradation and disgrace.                     CHAPTER XL        Shadows avaunt!&mdash;Richard&rsquo;s himself again.          R ICHARD  III          When the Black Knight&mdash;for it becomes necessary to resume the train of his  adventures&mdash;left the Trysting-tree of the generous Outlaw, he held his way  straight to a neighbouring religious house, of small extent and revenue, called  the Priory of Saint Botolph, to which the wounded Ivanhoe had been removed when  the castle was taken, under the guidance of the faithful Gurth, and the  magnanimous Wamba. It is unnecessary at present to mention what took place in  the interim betwixt Wilfred and his deliverer; suffice it to say, that after  long and grave communication, messengers were dispatched by the Prior in  several directions, and that on the succeeding morning the Black Knight was  about to set forth on his journey, accompanied by the jester Wamba, who  attended as his guide.          &ldquo;We will meet,&rdquo; he said to Ivanhoe, &ldquo;at Coningsburgh, the  castle of the deceased Athelstane, since there thy father Cedric holds the  funeral feast for his noble relation. I would see your Saxon kindred together,  Sir Wilfred, and become better acquainted with them than heretofore. Thou also  wilt meet me; and it shall be my task to reconcile thee to thy father.&rdquo;          So saying, he took an affectionate farewell of Ivanhoe, who expressed an  anxious desire to attend upon his deliverer. But the Black Knight would not  listen to the proposal.          &ldquo;Rest this day; thou wilt have scarce strength enough to travel on the  next. I will have no guide with me but honest Wamba, who can play priest or  fool as I shall be most in the humour.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;will attend you with all my heart. I  would fain see the feasting at the funeral of Athelstane; for, if it be not  full and frequent, he will rise from the dead to rebuke cook, sewer, and  cupbearer; and that were a sight worth seeing. Always, Sir Knight, I will trust  your valour with making my excuse to my master Cedric, in case mine own wit  should fail.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And how should my poor valour succeed, Sir Jester, when thy light wit  halts?&mdash;resolve me that.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Wit, Sir Knight,&rdquo; replied the Jester, &ldquo;may do much. He is a  quick, apprehensive knave, who sees his neighbours blind side, and knows how to  keep the lee-gage when his passions are blowing high. But valour is a sturdy  fellow, that makes all split. He rows against both wind and tide, and makes way  notwithstanding; and, therefore, good Sir Knight, while I take advantage of the  fair weather in our noble master&rsquo;s temper, I will expect you to bestir  yourself when it grows rough.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Sir Knight of the Fetterlock, since it is your pleasure so to be  distinguished,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe, &ldquo;I fear me you have chosen a  talkative and a troublesome fool to be your guide. But he knows every path and  alley in the woods as well as e&rsquo;er a hunter who frequents them; and the  poor knave, as thou hast partly seen, is as faithful as steel.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the Knight, &ldquo;an he have the gift of showing my  road, I shall not grumble with him that he desires to make it  pleasant.&mdash;Fare thee well, kind Wilfred&mdash;I charge thee not to attempt  to travel till to-morrow at earliest.&rdquo;          So saying, he extended his hand to Ivanhoe, who pressed it to his lips, took  leave of the Prior, mounted his horse, and departed, with Wamba for his  companion. Ivanhoe followed them with his eyes, until they were lost in the  shades of the surrounding forest, and then returned into the convent.          But shortly after matin-song, he requested to see the Prior. The old man came  in haste, and enquired anxiously after the state of his health.          &ldquo;It is better,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;than my fondest hope could have  anticipated; either my wound has been slighter than the effusion of blood led  me to suppose, or this balsam hath wrought a wonderful cure upon it. I feel  already as if I could bear my corslet; and so much the better, for thoughts  pass in my mind which render me unwilling to remain here longer in  inactivity.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Now, the saints forbid,&rdquo; said the Prior, &ldquo;that the son of  the Saxon Cedric should leave our convent ere his wounds were healed! It were  shame to our profession were we to suffer it.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nor would I desire to leave your hospitable roof, venerable  father,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe, &ldquo;did I not feel myself able to endure the  journey, and compelled to undertake it.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And what can have urged you to so sudden a departure?&rdquo; said the  Prior.          &ldquo;Have you never, holy father,&rdquo; answered the Knight, &ldquo;felt an  apprehension of approaching evil, for which you in vain attempted to assign a  cause?&mdash;Have you never found your mind darkened, like the sunny landscape,  by the sudden cloud, which augurs a coming tempest?&mdash;And thinkest thou not  that such impulses are deserving of attention, as being the hints of our  guardian spirits, that danger is impending?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I may not deny,&rdquo; said the Prior, crossing himself, &ldquo;that  such things have been, and have been of Heaven; but then such communications  have had a visibly useful scope and tendency. But thou, wounded as thou art,  what avails it thou shouldst follow the steps of him whom thou couldst not aid,  were he to be assaulted?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Prior,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe, &ldquo;thou dost mistake&mdash;I am stout  enough to exchange buffets with any who will challenge me to such a  traffic&mdash;But were it otherwise, may I not aid him were he in danger, by  other means than by force of arms? It is but too well known that the Saxons  love not the Norman race, and who knows what may be the issue, if he break in  upon them when their hearts are irritated by the death of Athelstane, and their  heads heated by the carousal in which they will indulge themselves? I hold his  entrance among them at such a moment most perilous, and I am resolved to share  or avert the danger; which, that I may the better do, I would crave of thee the  use of some palfrey whose pace may be softer than that of my  &lsquo;destrier&rsquo;.&rdquo;   56            &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said the worthy churchman; &ldquo;you shall have mine own  ambling jennet, and I would it ambled as easy for your sake as that of the  Abbot of Saint Albans. Yet this will I say for Malkin, for so I call her, that  unless you were to borrow a ride on the juggler&rsquo;s steed that paces a  hornpipe amongst the eggs, you could not go a journey on a creature so gentle  and smooth-paced. I have composed many a homily on her back, to the edification  of my brethren of the convent, and many poor Christian souls.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I pray you, reverend father,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe, &ldquo;let Malkin be  got ready instantly, and bid Gurth attend me with mine arms.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay, but fair sir,&rdquo; said the Prior, &ldquo;I pray you to remember  that Malkin hath as little skill in arms as her master, and that I warrant not  her enduring the sight or weight of your full panoply. O, Malkin, I promise  you, is a beast of judgment, and will contend against any undue weight&mdash;I  did but borrow the &lsquo;Fructus Temporum&rsquo; from the priest of Saint  Bees, and I promise you she would not stir from the gate until I had exchanged  the huge volume for my little breviary.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Trust me, holy father,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe, &ldquo;I will not distress  her with too much weight; and if she calls a combat with me, it is odds but she  has the worst.&rdquo;          This reply was made while Gurth was buckling on the Knight&rsquo;s heels a pair  of large gilded spurs, capable of convincing any restive horse that his best  safety lay in being conformable to the will of his rider.          The deep and sharp rowels with which Ivanhoe&rsquo;s heels were now armed,  began to make the worthy Prior repent of his courtesy, and  ejaculate,&mdash;&ldquo;Nay, but fair sir, now I bethink me, my Malkin abideth  not the spur&mdash;Better it were that you tarry for the mare of our manciple  down at the Grange, which may be had in little more than an hour, and cannot  but be tractable, in respect that she draweth much of our winter fire-wood, and  eateth no corn.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I thank you, reverend father, but will abide by your first offer, as I  see Malkin is already led forth to the gate. Gurth shall carry mine armour; and  for the rest, rely on it, that as I will not overload Malkin&rsquo;s back, she  shall not overcome my patience. And now, farewell!&rdquo;          Ivanhoe now descended the stairs more hastily and easily than his wound  promised, and threw himself upon the jennet, eager to escape the importunity of  the Prior, who stuck as closely to his side as his age and fatness would  permit, now singing the praises of Malkin, now recommending caution to the  Knight in managing her.          &ldquo;She is at the most dangerous period for maidens as well as mares,&rdquo;  said the old man, laughing at his own jest, &ldquo;being barely in her  fifteenth year.&rdquo;          Ivanhoe, who had other web to weave than to stand canvassing a palfrey&rsquo;s  paces with its owner, lent but a deaf ear to the Prior&rsquo;s grave advices  and facetious jests, and having leapt on his mare, and commanded his squire  (for such Gurth now called himself) to keep close by his side, he followed the  track of the Black Knight into the forest, while the Prior stood at the gate of  the convent looking after him, and ejaculating,&mdash;&ldquo;Saint Mary! how  prompt and fiery be these men of war! I would I had not trusted Malkin to his  keeping, for, crippled as I am with the cold rheum, I am undone if aught but  good befalls her. And yet,&rdquo; said he, recollecting himself, &ldquo;as I  would not spare my own old and disabled limbs in the good cause of Old England,  so Malkin must e&rsquo;en run her hazard on the same venture; and it may be  they will think our poor house worthy of some munificent guerdon&mdash;or, it  may be, they will send the old Prior a pacing nag. And if they do none of  these, as great men will forget little men&rsquo;s service, truly I shall hold  me well repaid in having done that which is right. And it is now well-nigh the  fitting time to summon the brethren to breakfast in the refectory&mdash;Ah! I  doubt they obey that call more cheerily than the bells for primes and  matins.&rdquo;          So the Prior of Saint Botolph&rsquo;s hobbled back again into the refectory, to  preside over the stockfish and ale, which was just serving out for the  friars&rsquo; breakfast. Busy and important, he sat him down at the table, and  many a dark word he threw out, of benefits to be expected to the convent, and  high deeds of service done by himself, which, at another season, would have  attracted observation. But as the stockfish was highly salted, and the ale  reasonably powerful, the jaws of the brethren were too anxiously employed to  admit of their making much use of their ears; nor do we read of any of the  fraternity, who was tempted to speculate upon the mysterious hints of their  Superior, except Father Diggory, who was severely afflicted by the toothache,  so that he could only eat on one side of his jaws.          In the meantime, the Black Champion and his guide were pacing at their leisure  through the recesses of the forest; the good Knight whiles humming to himself  the lay of some enamoured troubadour, sometimes encouraging by questions the  prating disposition of his attendant, so that their dialogue formed a whimsical  mixture of song and jest, of which we would fain give our readers some idea.  You are then to imagine this Knight, such as we have already described him,  strong of person, tall, broad-shouldered, and large of bone, mounted on his  mighty black charger, which seemed made on purpose to bear his weight, so  easily he paced forward under it, having the visor of his helmet raised, in  order to admit freedom of breath, yet keeping the beaver, or under part,  closed, so that his features could be but imperfectly distinguished. But his  ruddy embrowned cheek-bones could be plainly seen, and the large and bright  blue eyes, that flashed from under the dark shade of the raised visor; and the  whole gesture and look of the champion expressed careless gaiety and fearless  confidence&mdash;a mind which was unapt to apprehend danger, and prompt to defy  it when most imminent&mdash;yet with whom danger was a familiar thought, as  with one whose trade was war and adventure.          The Jester wore his usual fantastic habit, but late accidents had led him to  adopt a good cutting falchion, instead of his wooden sword, with a targe to  match it; of both which weapons he had, notwithstanding his profession, shown  himself a skilful master during the storming of Torquilstone. Indeed, the  infirmity of Wamba&rsquo;s brain consisted chiefly in a kind of impatient  irritability, which suffered him not long to remain quiet in any posture, or  adhere to any certain train of ideas, although he was for a few minutes alert  enough in performing any immediate task, or in apprehending any immediate  topic. On horseback, therefore, he was perpetually swinging himself backwards  and forwards, now on the horse&rsquo;s ears, then anon on the very rump of the  animal,&mdash;now hanging both his legs on one side, and now sitting with his  face to the tail, moping, mowing, and making a thousand apish gestures, until  his palfrey took his freaks so much to heart, as fairly to lay him at his  length on the green grass&mdash;an incident which greatly amused the Knight,  but compelled his companion to ride more steadily thereafter.          At the point of their journey at which we take them up, this joyous pair were  engaged in singing a virelai, as it was called, in which the clown bore a  mellow burden, to the better instructed Knight of the Fetterlock. And thus run  the ditty:&mdash;          Anna-Marie, love, up is the sun,   Anna-Marie, love, morn is begun,   Mists are dispersing, love, birds singing free,   Up in the morning, love, Anna-Marie.   Anna-Marie, love, up in the morn,   The hunter is winding blithe sounds on his horn,   The echo rings merry from rock and from tree,   &rsquo;Tis time to arouse thee, love, Anna-Marie.          Wamba.          O Tybalt, love, Tybalt, awake me not yet,   Around my soft pillow while softer dreams flit,   For what are the joys that in waking we prove,   Compared with these visions, O, Tybalt, my love?   Let the birds to the rise of the mist carol shrill,   Let the hunter blow out his loud horn on the hill,   Softer sounds, softer pleasures, in slumber I prove,&mdash;   But think not I dreamt of thee, Tybalt, my love.          &ldquo;A dainty song,&rdquo; said Wamba, when they had finished their carol,  &ldquo;and I swear by my bauble, a pretty moral!&mdash;I used to sing it with  Gurth, once my playfellow, and now, by the grace of God and his master, no less  than a freemen; and we once came by the cudgel for being so entranced by the  melody, that we lay in bed two hours after sunrise, singing the ditty betwixt  sleeping and waking&mdash;my bones ache at thinking of the tune ever since.  Nevertheless, I have played the part of Anna-Marie, to please you, fair  sir.&rdquo;          The Jester next struck into another carol, a sort of comic ditty, to which the  Knight, catching up the tune, replied in the like manner.          Knight and Wamba.          There came three merry men from south, west, and north,       Ever more sing the roundelay;   To win the Widow of Wycombe forth,       And where was the widow might say them nay?      The first was a knight, and from Tynedale he came,       Ever more sing the roundelay;   And his fathers, God save us, were men of great fame,       And where was the widow might say him nay?      Of his father the laird, of his uncle the squire,       He boasted in rhyme and in roundelay;   She bade him go bask by his sea-coal fire,       For she was the widow would say him nay.          Wamba.          The next that came forth, swore by blood and by nails,       Merrily sing the roundelay;   Hur&rsquo;s a gentleman, God wot, and hur&rsquo;s lineage was of Wales,       And where was the widow might say him nay?      Sir David ap Morgan ap Griffith ap Hugh       Ap Tudor ap Rhice, quoth his roundelay   She said that one widow for so many was too few,       And she bade the Welshman wend his way.      But then next came a yeoman, a yeoman of Kent,       Jollily singing his roundelay;   He spoke to the widow of living and rent,       And where was the widow could say him nay?          Both.          So the knight and the squire were both left in the mire,       There for to sing their roundelay;   For a yeoman of Kent, with his yearly rent,       There never was a widow could say him nay.          &ldquo;I would, Wamba,&rdquo; said the knight, &ldquo;that our host of the  Trysting-tree, or the jolly Friar, his chaplain, heard this thy ditty in praise  of our bluff yeoman.&rdquo;          &ldquo;So would not I,&rdquo; said Wamba&mdash;&ldquo;but for the horn that  hangs at your baldric.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said the Knight,&mdash;&ldquo;this is a pledge of  Locksley&rsquo;s goodwill, though I am not like to need it. Three mots on this  bugle will, I am assured, bring round, at our need, a jolly band of yonder  honest yeomen.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I would say, Heaven forefend,&rdquo; said the Jester, &ldquo;were it not  that that fair gift is a pledge they would let us pass peaceably.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Why, what meanest thou?&rdquo; said the Knight; &ldquo;thinkest thou  that but for this pledge of fellowship they would assault us?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay, for me I say nothing,&rdquo; said Wamba; &ldquo;for green trees  have ears as well as stone walls. But canst thou construe me this, Sir  Knight&mdash;When is thy wine-pitcher and thy purse better empty than  full?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Why, never, I think,&rdquo; replied the Knight.          &ldquo;Thou never deservest to have a full one in thy hand, for so simple an  answer! Thou hadst best empty thy pitcher ere thou pass it to a Saxon, and  leave thy money at home ere thou walk in the greenwood.&rdquo;          &ldquo;You hold our friends for robbers, then?&rdquo; said the Knight of the  Fetterlock.          &ldquo;You hear me not say so, fair sir,&rdquo; said Wamba; &ldquo;it may  relieve a man&rsquo;s steed to take of his mail when he hath a long journey to  make; and, certes, it may do good to the rider&rsquo;s soul to ease him of that  which is the root of evil; therefore will I give no hard names to those who do  such services. Only I would wish my mail at home, and my purse in my chamber,  when I meet with these good fellows, because it might save them some  trouble.&rdquo;          &ldquo;WE are bound to pray for them, my friend, notwithstanding the fair  character thou dost afford them.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Pray for them with all my heart,&rdquo; said Wamba; &ldquo;but in the  town, not in the greenwood, like the Abbot of Saint Bees, whom they caused to  say mass with an old hollow oak-tree for his stall.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Say as thou list, Wamba,&rdquo; replied the Knight, &ldquo;these yeomen  did thy master Cedric yeomanly service at Torquilstone.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay, truly,&rdquo; answered Wamba; &ldquo;but that was in the fashion of  their trade with Heaven.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Their trade, Wamba! how mean you by that?&rdquo; replied his companion.          &ldquo;Marry, thus,&rdquo; said the Jester. &ldquo;They make up a balanced  account with Heaven, as our old cellarer used to call his ciphering, as fair as  Isaac the Jew keeps with his debtors, and, like him, give out a very little,  and take large credit for doing so; reckoning, doubtless, on their own behalf  the seven-fold usury which the blessed text hath promised to charitable  loans.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Give me an example of your meaning, Wamba,&mdash;I know nothing of  ciphers or rates of usage,&rdquo; answered the Knight.          &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;an your valour be so dull, you will  please to learn that those honest fellows balance a good deed with one not  quite so laudable; as a crown given to a begging friar with an hundred byzants  taken from a fat abbot, or a wench kissed in the greenwood with the relief of a  poor widow.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Which of these was the good deed, which was the felony?&rdquo;  interrupted the Knight.          &ldquo;A good gibe! a good gibe!&rdquo; said Wamba; &ldquo;keeping witty  company sharpeneth the apprehension. You said nothing so well, Sir Knight, I  will be sworn, when you held drunken vespers with the bluff Hermit.&mdash;But  to go on. The merry-men of the forest set off the building of a cottage with  the burning of a castle,&mdash;the thatching of a choir against the robbing of  a church,&mdash;the setting free a poor prisoner against the murder of a proud  sheriff; or, to come nearer to our point, the deliverance of a Saxon franklin  against the burning alive of a Norman baron. Gentle thieves they are, in short,  and courteous robbers; but it is ever the luckiest to meet with them when they  are at the worst.&rdquo;          &ldquo;How so, Wamba?&rdquo; said the Knight.          &ldquo;Why, then they have some compunction, and are for making up matters with  Heaven. But when they have struck an even balance, Heaven help them with whom  they next open the account! The travellers who first met them after their good  service at Torquilstone would have a woeful flaying.&mdash;And yet,&rdquo; said  Wamba, coming close up to the Knight&rsquo;s side, &ldquo;there be companions  who are far more dangerous for travellers to meet than yonder outlaws.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And who may they be, for you have neither bears nor wolves, I  trow?&rdquo; said the Knight.          &ldquo;Marry, sir, but we have Malvoisin&rsquo;s men-at-arms,&rdquo; said  Wamba; &ldquo;and let me tell you, that, in time of civil war, a halfscore of  these is worth a band of wolves at any time. They are now expecting their  harvest, and are reinforced with the soldiers that escaped from Torquilstone.  So that, should we meet with a band of them, we are like to pay for our feats  of arms.&mdash;Now, I pray you, Sir Knight, what would you do if we met two of  them?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Pin the villains to the earth with my lance, Wamba, if they offered us  any impediment.&rdquo;          &ldquo;But what if there were four of them?&rdquo;          &ldquo;They should drink of the same cup,&rdquo; answered the Knight.          &ldquo;What if six,&rdquo; continued Wamba, &ldquo;and we as we now are, barely  two&mdash;would you not remember Locksley&rsquo;s horn?&rdquo;          &ldquo;What! sound for aid,&rdquo; exclaimed the Knight, &ldquo;against a score  of such &lsquo;rascaille&rsquo; as these, whom one good knight could drive  before him, as the wind drives the withered leaves?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay, then,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;I will pray you for a close sight  of that same horn that hath so powerful a breath.&rdquo;          The Knight undid the clasp of the baldric, and indulged his fellow-traveller,  who immediately hung the bugle round his own neck.          &ldquo;Tra-lira-la,&rdquo; said he, whistling the notes; &ldquo;nay, I know my  gamut as well as another.&rdquo;          &ldquo;How mean you, knave?&rdquo; said the Knight; &ldquo;restore me the  bugle.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Content you, Sir Knight, it is in safe keeping. When Valour and Folly  travel, Folly should bear the horn, because she can blow the best.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay but, rogue,&rdquo; said the Black Knight, &ldquo;this exceedeth thy  license&mdash;Beware ye tamper not with my patience.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Urge me not with violence, Sir Knight,&rdquo; said the Jester, keeping  at a distance from the impatient champion, &ldquo;or Folly will show a clean  pair of heels, and leave Valour to find out his way through the wood as best he  may.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay, thou hast hit me there,&rdquo; said the Knight; &ldquo;and, sooth  to say, I have little time to jangle with thee. Keep the horn an thou wilt, but  let us proceed on our journey.&rdquo;          &ldquo;You will not harm me, then?&rdquo; said Wamba.          &ldquo;I tell thee no, thou knave!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay, but pledge me your knightly word for it,&rdquo; continued Wamba, as  he approached with great caution.          &ldquo;My knightly word I pledge; only come on with thy foolish self.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay, then, Valour and Folly are once more boon companions,&rdquo; said  the Jester, coming up frankly to the Knight&rsquo;s side; &ldquo;but, in truth,  I love not such buffets as that you bestowed on the burly Friar, when his  holiness rolled on the green like a king of the nine-pins. And now that Folly  wears the horn, let Valour rouse himself, and shake his mane; for, if I mistake  not, there are company in yonder brake that are on the look-out for us.&rdquo;          &ldquo;What makes thee judge so?&rdquo; said the Knight.          &ldquo;Because I have twice or thrice noticed the glance of a motion from  amongst the green leaves. Had they been honest men, they had kept the path. But  yonder thicket is a choice chapel for the Clerks of Saint Nicholas.&rdquo;          &ldquo;By my faith,&rdquo; said the Knight, closing his visor, &ldquo;I think  thou be&rsquo;st in the right on&rsquo;t.&rdquo;          And in good time did he close it, for three arrows, flew at the same instant  from the suspected spot against his head and breast, one of which would have  penetrated to the brain, had it not been turned aside by the steel visor. The  other two were averted by the gorget, and by the shield which hung around his  neck.          &ldquo;Thanks, trusty armourers,&rdquo; said the Knight.&mdash;&ldquo;Wamba,  let us close with them,&rdquo;&mdash;and he rode straight to the thicket. He  was met by six or seven men-at-arms, who ran against him with their lances at  full career. Three of the weapons struck against him, and splintered with as  little effect as if they had been driven against a tower of steel. The Black  Knight&rsquo;s eyes seemed to flash fire even through the aperture of his  visor. He raised himself in his stirrups with an air of inexpressible dignity,  and exclaimed, &ldquo;What means this, my masters!&rdquo;&mdash;The men made no  other reply than by drawing their swords and attacking him on every side,  crying, &ldquo;Die, tyrant!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ha! Saint Edward! Ha! Saint George!&rdquo; said the Black Knight,  striking down a man at every invocation; &ldquo;have we traitors here?&rdquo;          His opponents, desperate as they were, bore back from an arm which carried  death in every blow, and it seemed as if the terror of his single strength was  about to gain the battle against such odds, when a knight, in blue armour, who  had hitherto kept himself behind the other assailants, spurred forward with his  lance, and taking aim, not at the rider but at the steed, wounded the noble  animal mortally.          &ldquo;That was a felon stroke!&rdquo; exclaimed the Black Knight, as the steed  fell to the earth, bearing his rider along with him.          And at this moment, Wamba winded the bugle, for the whole had passed so  speedily, that he had not time to do so sooner. The sudden sound made the  murderers bear back once more, and Wamba, though so imperfectly weaponed, did  not hesitate to rush in and assist the Black Knight to rise.          &ldquo;Shame on ye, false cowards!&rdquo; exclaimed he in the blue harness, who  seemed to lead the assailants, &ldquo;do ye fly from the empty blast of a horn  blown by a Jester?&rdquo;          Animated by his words, they attacked the Black Knight anew, whose best refuge  was now to place his back against an oak, and defend himself with his sword.  The felon knight, who had taken another spear, watching the moment when his  formidable antagonist was most closely pressed, galloped against him in hopes  to nail him with his lance against the tree, when his purpose was again  intercepted by Wamba. The Jester, making up by agility the want of strength,  and little noticed by the men-at-arms, who were busied in their more important  object, hovered on the skirts of the fight, and effectually checked the fatal  career of the Blue Knight, by hamstringing his horse with a stroke of his  sword. Horse and man went to the ground; yet the situation of the Knight of the  Fetterlock continued very precarious, as he was pressed close by several men  completely armed, and began to be fatigued by the violent exertions necessary  to defend himself on so many points at nearly the same moment, when a  grey-goose shaft suddenly stretched on the earth one of the most formidable of  his assailants, and a band of yeomen broke forth from the glade, headed by  Locksley and the jovial Friar, who, taking ready and effectual part in the  fray, soon disposed of the ruffians, all of whom lay on the spot dead or  mortally wounded. The Black Knight thanked his deliverers with a dignity they  had not observed in his former bearing, which hitherto had seemed rather that  of a blunt bold soldier, than of a person of exalted rank.          &ldquo;It concerns me much,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;even before I express my  full gratitude to my ready friends, to discover, if I may, who have been my  unprovoked enemies.&mdash;Open the visor of that Blue Knight, Wamba, who seems  the chief of these villains.&rdquo;          The Jester instantly made up to the leader of the assassins, who, bruised by  his fall, and entangled under the wounded steed, lay incapable either of flight  or resistance.          &ldquo;Come, valiant sir,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;I must be your armourer as  well as your equerry&mdash;I have dismounted you, and now I will unhelm  you.&rdquo;          So saying, with no very gentle hand he undid the helmet of the Blue Knight,  which, rolling to a distance on the grass, displayed to the Knight of the  Fetterlock grizzled locks, and a countenance he did not expect to have seen  under such circumstances.          &ldquo;Waldemar Fitzurse!&rdquo; he said in astonishment; &ldquo;what could  urge one of thy rank and seeming worth to so foul an undertaking?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; said the captive Knight, looking up to him, &ldquo;thou  knowest little of mankind, if thou knowest not to what ambition and revenge can  lead every child of Adam.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Revenge?&rdquo; answered the Black Knight; &ldquo;I never wronged  thee&mdash;On me thou hast nought to revenge.&rdquo;          &ldquo;My daughter, Richard, whose alliance thou didst scorn&mdash;was that no  injury to a Norman, whose blood is noble as thine own?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thy daughter?&rdquo; replied the Black Knight; &ldquo;a proper cause of  enmity, and followed up to a bloody issue!&mdash;Stand back, my masters, I  would speak to him alone.&mdash;And now, Waldemar Fitzurse, say me the  truth&mdash;confess who set thee on this traitorous deed.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thy father&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; answered Waldemar, &ldquo;who, in so  doing, did but avenge on thee thy disobedience to thy father.&rdquo;          Richard&rsquo;s eyes sparkled with indignation, but his better nature overcame  it. He pressed his hand against his brow, and remained an instant gazing on the  face of the humbled baron, in whose features pride was contending with shame.          &ldquo;Thou dost not ask thy life, Waldemar,&rdquo; said the King.          &ldquo;He that is in the lion&rsquo;s clutch,&rdquo; answered Fitzurse,  &ldquo;knows it were needless.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Take it, then, unasked,&rdquo; said Richard; &ldquo;the lion preys not  on prostrate carcasses.&mdash;Take thy life, but with this condition, that in  three days thou shalt leave England, and go to hide thine infamy in thy Norman  castle, and that thou wilt never mention the name of John of Anjou as connected  with thy felony. If thou art found on English ground after the space I have  allotted thee, thou diest&mdash;or if thou breathest aught that can attaint the  honour of my house, by Saint George! not the altar itself shall be a sanctuary.  I will hang thee out to feed the ravens, from the very pinnacle of thine own  castle.&mdash;Let this knight have a steed, Locksley, for I see your yeomen  have caught those which were running loose, and let him depart unharmed.&rdquo;          &ldquo;But that I judge I listen to a voice whose behests must not be  disputed,&rdquo; answered the yeoman, &ldquo;I would send a shaft after the  skulking villain that should spare him the labour of a long journey.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou bearest an English heart, Locksley,&rdquo; said the Black Knight,  &ldquo;and well dost judge thou art the more bound to obey my behest&mdash;I am  Richard of England!&rdquo;          At these words, pronounced in a tone of majesty suited to the high rank, and no  less distinguished character of Cœur-de-Lion, the yeomen at once kneeled down  before him, and at the same time tendered their allegiance, and implored pardon  for their offences.          &ldquo;Rise, my friends,&rdquo; said Richard, in a gracious tone, looking on  them with a countenance in which his habitual good-humour had already conquered  the blaze of hasty resentment, and whose features retained no mark of the late  desperate conflict, excepting the flush arising from  exertion,&mdash;&ldquo;Arise,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my friends!&mdash;Your  misdemeanours, whether in forest or field, have been atoned by the loyal  services you rendered my distressed subjects before the walls of Torquilstone,  and the rescue you have this day afforded to your sovereign. Arise, my  liegemen, and be good subjects in future.&mdash;And thou, brave  Locksley&mdash;&rdquo;          &ldquo;Call me no longer Locksley, my Liege, but know me under the name, which,  I fear, fame hath blown too widely not to have reached even your royal  ears&mdash;I am Robin Hood of Sherwood Forest.&rdquo;   561            &ldquo;King of Outlaws, and Prince of good fellows!&rdquo; said the King,  &ldquo;who hath not heard a name that has been borne as far as Palestine? But  be assured, brave Outlaw, that no deed done in our absence, and in the  turbulent times to which it hath given rise, shall be remembered to thy  disadvantage.&rdquo;          &ldquo;True says the proverb,&rdquo; said Wamba, interposing his word, but with  some abatement of his usual petulance,&mdash;          &ldquo;&lsquo;When the cat is away,   The mice will play.&rsquo;&rdquo;          &ldquo;What, Wamba, art thou there?&rdquo; said Richard; &ldquo;I have been so  long of hearing thy voice, I thought thou hadst taken flight.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I take flight!&rdquo; said Wamba; &ldquo;when do you ever find Folly  separated from Valour? There lies the trophy of my sword, that good grey  gelding, whom I heartily wish upon his legs again, conditioning his master lay  there houghed in his place. It is true, I gave a little ground at first, for a  motley jacket does not brook lance-heads, as a steel doublet will. But if I  fought not at sword&rsquo;s point, you will grant me that I sounded the  onset.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And to good purpose, honest Wamba,&rdquo; replied the King. &ldquo;Thy  good service shall not be forgotten.&rdquo;          &ldquo;&lsquo;Confiteor! Confiteor!&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;exclaimed, in a  submissive tone, a voice near the King&rsquo;s side&mdash;&ldquo;my Latin will  carry me no farther&mdash;but I confess my deadly treason, and pray leave to  have absolution before I am led to execution!&rdquo;          Richard looked around, and beheld the jovial Friar on his knees, telling his  rosary, while his quarter-staff, which had not been idle during the skirmish,  lay on the grass beside him. His countenance was gathered so as he thought  might best express the most profound contrition, his eyes being turned up, and  the corners of his mouth drawn down, as Wamba expressed it, like the tassels at  the mouth of a purse. Yet this demure affectation of extreme penitence was  whimsically belied by a ludicrous meaning which lurked in his huge features,  and seemed to pronounce his fear and repentance alike hypocritical.          &ldquo;For what art thou cast down, mad Priest?&rdquo; said Richard; &ldquo;art  thou afraid thy diocesan should learn how truly thou dost serve Our Lady and  Saint Dunstan?&mdash;Tush, man! fear it not; Richard of England betrays no  secrets that pass over the flagon.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay, most gracious sovereign,&rdquo; answered the Hermit, (well known to  the curious in penny-histories of Robin Hood, by the name of Friar Tuck,)  &ldquo;it is not the crosier I fear, but the sceptre.&mdash;Alas! that my  sacrilegious fist should ever have been applied to the ear of the Lord&rsquo;s  anointed!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;sits the wind there?&mdash;In truth  I had forgotten the buffet, though mine ear sung after it for a whole day. But  if the cuff was fairly given, I will be judged by the good men around, if it  was not as well repaid&mdash;or, if thou thinkest I still owe thee aught, and  will stand forth for another counterbuff&mdash;&rdquo;          &ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; replied Friar Tuck, &ldquo;I had mine own returned,  and with usury&mdash;may your Majesty ever pay your debts as fully!&rdquo;          &ldquo;If I could do so with cuffs,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;my creditors  should have little reason to complain of an empty exchequer.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said the Friar, resuming his demure hypocritical  countenance, &ldquo;I know not what penance I ought to perform for that most  sacrilegious blow!&mdash;-&rdquo;          &ldquo;Speak no more of it, brother,&rdquo; said the King; &ldquo;after having  stood so many cuffs from Paynims and misbelievers, I were void of reason to  quarrel with the buffet of a clerk so holy as he of Copmanhurst. Yet, mine  honest Friar, I think it would be best both for the church and thyself, that I  should procure a license to unfrock thee, and retain thee as a yeoman of our  guard, serving in care of our person, as formerly in attendance upon the altar  of Saint Dunstan.&rdquo;          &ldquo;My Liege,&rdquo; said the Friar, &ldquo;I humbly crave your pardon; and  you would readily grant my excuse, did you but know how the sin of laziness has  beset me. Saint Dunstan&mdash;may he be gracious to us!&mdash;stands quiet in  his niche, though I should forget my orisons in killing a fat buck&mdash;I stay  out of my cell sometimes a night, doing I wot not what&mdash;Saint Dunstan  never complains&mdash;a quiet master he is, and a peaceful, as ever was made of  wood.&mdash;But to be a yeoman in attendance on my sovereign the King&mdash;the  honour is great, doubtless&mdash;yet, if I were but to step aside to comfort a  widow in one corner, or to kill a deer in another, it would be, &lsquo;where is  the dog Priest?&rsquo; says one. &lsquo;Who has seen the accursed Tuck?&rsquo;  says another. &lsquo;The unfrocked villain destroys more venison than half the  country besides,&rsquo; says one keeper; &lsquo;And is hunting after every shy  doe in the country!&rsquo; quoth a second.&mdash;In fine, good my Liege, I pray  you to leave me as you found me; or, if in aught you desire to extend your  benevolence to me, that I may be considered as the poor Clerk of Saint  Dunstan&rsquo;s cell in Copmanhurst, to whom any small donation will be most  thankfully acceptable.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I understand thee,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;and the Holy Clerk shall  have a grant of vert and venison in my woods of Warncliffe. Mark, however, I  will but assign thee three bucks every season; but if that do not prove an  apology for thy slaying thirty, I am no Christian knight nor true king.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Your Grace may be well assured,&rdquo; said the Friar, &ldquo;that, with  the grace of Saint Dunstan, I shall find the way of multiplying your most  bounteous gift.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I nothing doubt it, good brother,&rdquo; said the King; &ldquo;and as  venison is but dry food, our cellarer shall have orders to deliver to thee a  butt of sack, a runlet of Malvoisie, and three hogsheads of ale of the first  strike, yearly&mdash;If that will not quench thy thirst, thou must come to  court, and become acquainted with my butler.&rdquo;          &ldquo;But for Saint Dunstan?&rdquo; said the Friar&mdash;          &ldquo;A cope, a stole, and an altar-cloth shalt thou also have,&rdquo;  continued the King, crossing himself&mdash;&ldquo;But we may not turn our game  into earnest, lest God punish us for thinking more on our follies than on his  honour and worship.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I will answer for my patron,&rdquo; said the Priest, joyously.          &ldquo;Answer for thyself, Friar,&rdquo; said King Richard, something sternly;  but immediately stretching out his hand to the Hermit, the latter, somewhat  abashed, bent his knee, and saluted it. &ldquo;Thou dost less honour to my  extended palm than to my clenched fist,&rdquo; said the Monarch; &ldquo;thou  didst only kneel to the one, and to the other didst prostrate thyself.&rdquo;          But the Friar, afraid perhaps of again giving offence by continuing the  conversation in too jocose a style&mdash;a false step to be particularly  guarded against by those who converse with monarchs&mdash;bowed profoundly, and  fell into the rear.          At the same time, two additional personages appeared on the scene.                     CHAPTER XLI        All hail to the lordlings of high degree,   Who live not more happy, though greater than we!       Our pastimes to see,       Under every green tree,   In all the gay woodland, right welcome ye be.          M ACDONALD           The new comers were Wilfred of Ivanhoe, on the Prior of Botolph&rsquo;s  palfrey, and Gurth, who attended him, on the Knight&rsquo;s own war-horse. The  astonishment of Ivanhoe was beyond bounds, when he saw his master besprinkled  with blood, and six or seven dead bodies lying around in the little glade in  which the battle had taken place. Nor was he less surprised to see Richard  surrounded by so many silvan attendants, the outlaws, as they seemed to be, of  the forest, and a perilous retinue therefore for a prince. He hesitated whether  to address the King as the Black Knight-errant, or in what other manner to  demean himself towards him. Richard saw his embarrassment.          &ldquo;Fear not, Wilfred,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to address Richard Plantagenet  as himself, since thou seest him in the company of true English hearts,  although it may be they have been urged a few steps aside by warm English  blood.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe,&rdquo; said the gallant Outlaw, stepping  forward, &ldquo;my assurances can add nothing to those of our sovereign; yet,  let me say somewhat proudly, that of men who have suffered much, he hath not  truer subjects than those who now stand around him.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I cannot doubt it, brave man,&rdquo; said Wilfred, &ldquo;since thou art  of the number&mdash;But what mean these marks of death and danger? these slain  men, and the bloody armour of my Prince?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Treason hath been with us, Ivanhoe,&rdquo; said the King; &ldquo;but,  thanks to these brave men, treason hath met its meed&mdash;But, now I bethink  me, thou too art a traitor,&rdquo; said Richard, smiling; &ldquo;a most  disobedient traitor; for were not our orders positive, that thou shouldst  repose thyself at Saint Botolph&rsquo;s until thy wound was healed?&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is healed,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe; &ldquo;it is not of more consequence  than the scratch of a bodkin. But why, oh why, noble Prince, will you thus vex  the hearts of your faithful servants, and expose your life by lonely journeys  and rash adventures, as if it were of no more value than that of a mere  knight-errant, who has no interest on earth but what lance and sword may  procure him?&rdquo;          &ldquo;And Richard Plantagenet,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;desires no more  fame than his good lance and sword may acquire him&mdash;and Richard  Plantagenet is prouder of achieving an adventure, with only his good sword, and  his good arm to speed, than if he led to battle a host of an hundred thousand  armed men.&rdquo;          &ldquo;But your kingdom, my Liege,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe, &ldquo;your kingdom is  threatened with dissolution and civil war&mdash;your subjects menaced with  every species of evil, if deprived of their sovereign in some of those dangers  which it is your daily pleasure to incur, and from which you have but this  moment narrowly escaped.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ho! ho! my kingdom and my subjects?&rdquo; answered Richard,  impatiently; &ldquo;I tell thee, Sir Wilfred, the best of them are most willing  to repay my follies in kind&mdash;For example, my very faithful servant,  Wilfred of Ivanhoe, will not obey my positive commands, and yet reads his king  a homily, because he does not walk exactly by his advice. Which of us has most  reason to upbraid the other?&mdash;Yet forgive me, my faithful Wilfred. The  time I have spent, and am yet to spend in concealment, is, as I explained to  thee at Saint Botolph&rsquo;s, necessary to give my friends and faithful nobles  time to assemble their forces, that when Richard&rsquo;s return is announced,  he should be at the head of such a force as enemies shall tremble to face, and  thus subdue the meditated treason, without even unsheathing a sword.  Estoteville and Bohun will not be strong enough to move forward to York for  twenty-four hours. I must have news of Salisbury from the south; and of  Beauchamp, in Warwickshire; and of Multon and Percy in the north. The  Chancellor must make sure of London. Too sudden an appearance would subject me  to dangers, other than my lance and sword, though backed by the bow of bold  Robin, or the quarter-staff of Friar Tuck, and the horn of the sage Wamba, may  be able to rescue me from.&rdquo;          Wilfred bowed in submission, well knowing how vain it was to contend with the  wild spirit of chivalry which so often impelled his master upon dangers which  he might easily have avoided, or rather, which it was unpardonable in him to  have sought out. The young knight sighed, therefore, and held his peace; while  Richard, rejoiced at having silenced his counsellor, though his heart  acknowledged the justice of the charge he had brought against him, went on in  conversation with Robin Hood.&mdash;&ldquo;King of Outlaws,&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;have you no refreshment to offer to your brother sovereign? for these  dead knaves have found me both in exercise and appetite.&rdquo;          &ldquo;In troth,&rdquo; replied the Outlaw, &ldquo;for I scorn to lie to your  Grace, our larder is chiefly supplied with&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped, and was  somewhat embarrassed.          &ldquo;With venison, I suppose?&rdquo; said Richard, gaily; &ldquo;better food  at need there can be none&mdash;and truly, if a king will not remain at home  and slay his own game, methinks he should not brawl too loud if he finds it  killed to his hand.&rdquo;          &ldquo;If your Grace, then,&rdquo; said Robin, &ldquo;will again honour with  your presence one of Robin Hood&rsquo;s places of rendezvous, the venison shall  not be lacking; and a stoup of ale, and it may be a cup of reasonably good  wine, to relish it withal.&rdquo;          The Outlaw accordingly led the way, followed by the buxom Monarch, more happy,  probably, in this chance meeting with Robin Hood and his foresters, than he  would have been in again assuming his royal state, and presiding over a  splendid circle of peers and nobles. Novelty in society and adventure were the  zest of life to Richard Cœur-de-Lion, and it had its highest relish when  enhanced by dangers encountered and surmounted. In the lion-hearted King, the  brilliant, but useless character, of a knight of romance, was in a great  measure realized and revived; and the personal glory which he acquired by his  own deeds of arms, was far more dear to his excited imagination, than that  which a course of policy and wisdom would have spread around his government.  Accordingly, his reign was like the course of a brilliant and rapid meteor,  which shoots along the face of Heaven, shedding around an unnecessary and  portentous light, which is instantly swallowed up by universal darkness; his  feats of chivalry furnishing themes for bards and minstrels, but affording none  of those solid benefits to his country on which history loves to pause, and  hold up as an example to posterity. But in his present company Richard showed  to the greatest imaginable advantage. He was gay, good-humoured, and fond of  manhood in every rank of life.          Beneath a huge oak-tree the silvan repast was hastily prepared for the King of  England, surrounded by men outlaws to his government, but who now formed his  court and his guard. As the flagon went round, the rough foresters soon lost  their awe for the presence of Majesty. The song and the jest were  exchanged&mdash;the stories of former deeds were told with advantage; and at  length, and while boasting of their successful infraction of the laws, no one  recollected they were speaking in presence of their natural guardian. The merry  King, nothing heeding his dignity any more than his company, laughed, quaffed,  and jested among the jolly band. The natural and rough sense of Robin Hood led  him to be desirous that the scene should be closed ere any thing should occur  to disturb its harmony, the more especially that he observed Ivanhoe&rsquo;s  brow clouded with anxiety. &ldquo;We are honoured,&rdquo; he said to Ivanhoe,  apart, &ldquo;by the presence of our gallant Sovereign; yet I would not that he  dallied with time, which the circumstances of his kingdom may render  precious.&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is well and wisely spoken, brave Robin Hood,&rdquo; said Wilfred,  apart; &ldquo;and know, moreover, that they who jest with Majesty even in its  gayest mood are but toying with the lion&rsquo;s whelp, which, on slight  provocation, uses both fangs and claws.&rdquo;          &ldquo;You have touched the very cause of my fear,&rdquo; said the Outlaw;  &ldquo;my men are rough by practice and nature, the King is hasty as well as  good-humoured; nor know I how soon cause of offence may arise, or how warmly it  may be received&mdash;it is time this revel were broken off.&rdquo;          &ldquo;It must be by your management then, gallant yeoman,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe;  &ldquo;for each hint I have essayed to give him serves only to induce him to  prolong it.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Must I so soon risk the pardon and favour of my Sovereign?&rdquo; said  Robin Hood, pausing for all instant; &ldquo;but by Saint Christopher, it shall  be so. I were undeserving his grace did I not peril it for his  good.&mdash;Here, Scathlock, get thee behind yonder thicket, and wind me a  Norman blast on thy bugle, and without an instant&rsquo;s delay on peril of  your life.&rdquo;          Scathlock obeyed his captain, and in less than five minutes the revellers were  startled by the sound of his horn.          &ldquo;It is the bugle of Malvoisin,&rdquo; said the Miller, starting to his  feet, and seizing his bow. The Friar dropped the flagon, and grasped his  quarter-staff. Wamba stopt short in the midst of a jest, and betook himself to  sword and target. All the others stood to their weapons.          Men of their precarious course of life change readily from the banquet to the  battle; and, to Richard, the exchange seemed but a succession of pleasure. He  called for his helmet and the most cumbrous parts of his armour, which he had  laid aside; and while Gurth was putting them on, he laid his strict injunctions  on Wilfred, under pain of his highest displeasure, not to engage in the  skirmish which he supposed was approaching.          &ldquo;Thou hast fought for me an hundred times, Wilfred,&mdash;and I have seen  it. Thou shalt this day look on, and see how Richard will fight for his friend  and liegeman.&rdquo;          In the meantime, Robin Hood had sent off several of his followers in different  directions, as if to reconnoitre the enemy; and when he saw the company  effectually broken up, he approached Richard, who was now completely armed,  and, kneeling down on one knee, craved pardon of his Sovereign.          &ldquo;For what, good yeoman?&rdquo; said Richard, somewhat impatiently.  &ldquo;Have we not already granted thee a full pardon for all transgressions?  Thinkest thou our word is a feather, to be blown backward and forward between  us? Thou canst not have had time to commit any new offence since that  time?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay, but I have though,&rdquo; answered the yeoman, &ldquo;if it be an  offence to deceive my prince for his own advantage. The bugle you have heard  was none of Malvoisin&rsquo;s, but blown by my direction, to break off the  banquet, lest it trenched upon hours of dearer import than to be thus dallied  with.&rdquo;          He then rose from his knee, folded his arm on his bosom, and in a manner rather  respectful than submissive, awaited the answer of the King,&mdash;like one who  is conscious he may have given offence, yet is confident in the rectitude of  his motive. The blood rushed in anger to the countenance of Richard; but it was  the first transient emotion, and his sense of justice instantly subdued it.          &ldquo;The King of Sherwood,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;grudges his venison and his  wine-flask to the King of England? It is well, bold Robin!&mdash;but when you  come to see me in merry London, I trust to be a less niggard host. Thou art  right, however, good fellow. Let us therefore to horse and away&mdash;Wilfred  has been impatient this hour. Tell me, bold Robin, hast thou never a friend in  thy band, who, not content with advising, will needs direct thy motions, and  look miserable when thou dost presume to act for thyself?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Such a one,&rdquo; said Robin, &ldquo;is my Lieutenant, Little John, who  is even now absent on an expedition as far as the borders of Scotland; and I  will own to your Majesty, that I am sometimes displeased by the freedom of his  councils&mdash;but, when I think twice, I cannot be long angry with one who can  have no motive for his anxiety save zeal for his master&rsquo;s service.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou art right, good yeoman,&rdquo; answered Richard; &ldquo;and if I  had Ivanhoe, on the one hand, to give grave advice, and recommend it by the sad  gravity of his brow, and thee, on the other, to trick me into what thou  thinkest my own good, I should have as little the freedom of mine own will as  any king in Christendom or Heathenesse.&mdash;But come, sirs, let us merrily on  to Coningsburgh, and think no more on&rsquo;t.&rdquo;          Robin Hood assured them that he had detached a party in the direction of the  road they were to pass, who would not fail to discover and apprize them of any  secret ambuscade; and that he had little doubt they would find the ways secure,  or, if otherwise, would receive such timely notice of the danger as would  enable them to fall back on a strong troop of archers, with which he himself  proposed to follow on the same route.          The wise and attentive precautions adopted for his safety touched  Richard&rsquo;s feelings, and removed any slight grudge which he might retain  on account of the deception the Outlaw Captain had practised upon him. He once  more extended his hand to Robin Hood, assured him of his full pardon and future  favour, as well as his firm resolution to restrain the tyrannical exercise of  the forest rights and other oppressive laws, by which so many English yeomen  were driven into a state of rebellion. But Richard&rsquo;s good intentions  towards the bold Outlaw were frustrated by the King&rsquo;s untimely death; and  the Charter of the Forest was extorted from the unwilling hands of King John  when he succeeded to his heroic brother. As for the rest of Robin Hood&rsquo;s  career, as well as the tale of his treacherous death, they are to be found in  those black-letter garlands, once sold at the low and easy rate of one  halfpenny.          &ldquo;Now cheaply purchased at their weight in gold.&rdquo;          The Outlaw&rsquo;s opinion proved true; and the King, attended by Ivanhoe,  Gurth, and Wamba, arrived, without any interruption, within view of the Castle  of Coningsburgh, while the sun was yet in the horizon.          There are few more beautiful or striking scenes in England, than are presented  by the vicinity of this ancient Saxon fortress. The soft and gentle river Don  sweeps through an amphitheatre, in which cultivation is richly blended with  woodland, and on a mount, ascending from the river, well defended by walls and  ditches, rises this ancient edifice, which, as its Saxon name implies, was,  previous to the Conquest, a royal residence of the kings of England. The outer  walls have probably been added by the Normans, but the inner keep bears token  of very great antiquity. It is situated on a mount at one angle of the inner  court, and forms a complete circle of perhaps twenty-five feet in diameter. The  wall is of immense thickness, and is propped or defended by six huge external  buttresses which project from the circle, and rise up against the sides of the  tower as if to strengthen or to support it. These massive buttresses are solid  when they arise from the foundation, and a good way higher up; but are hollowed  out towards the top, and terminate in a sort of turrets communicating with the  interior of the keep itself. The distant appearance of this huge building, with  these singular accompaniments, is as interesting to the lovers of the  picturesque, as the interior of the castle is to the eager antiquary, whose  imagination it carries back to the days of the Heptarchy. A barrow, in the  vicinity of the castle, is pointed out as the tomb of the memorable Hengist;  and various monuments, of great antiquity and curiosity, are shown in the  neighbouring churchyard.   57            When Cœur-de-Lion and his retinue approached this rude yet stately building,  it was not, as at present, surrounded by external fortifications. The Saxon  architect had exhausted his art in rendering the main keep defensible, and  there was no other circumvallation than a rude barrier of palisades.          A huge black banner, which floated from the top of the tower, announced that  the obsequies of the late owner were still in the act of being solemnized. It  bore no emblem of the deceased&rsquo;s birth or quality, for armorial bearings  were then a novelty among the Norman chivalry themselves and, were totally  unknown to the Saxons. But above the gate was another banner, on which the  figure of a white horse, rudely painted, indicated the nation and rank of the  deceased, by the well-known symbol of Hengist and his Saxon warriors.          All around the castle was a scene of busy commotion; for such funeral banquets  were times of general and profuse hospitality, which not only every one who  could claim the most distant connexion with the deceased, but all passengers  whatsoever, were invited to partake. The wealth and consequence of the deceased  Athelstane, occasioned this custom to be observed in the fullest extent.          Numerous parties, therefore, were seen ascending and descending the hill on  which the castle was situated; and when the King and his attendants entered the  open and unguarded gates of the external barrier, the space within presented a  scene not easily reconciled with the cause of the assemblage. In one place  cooks were toiling to roast huge oxen, and fat sheep; in another, hogsheads of  ale were set abroach, to be drained at the freedom of all comers. Groups of  every description were to be seen devouring the food and swallowing the liquor  thus abandoned to their discretion. The naked Saxon serf was drowning the sense  of his half-year&rsquo;s hunger and thirst, in one day of gluttony and  drunkenness&mdash;the more pampered burgess and guild-brother was eating his  morsel with gust, or curiously criticising the quantity of the malt and the  skill of the brewer. Some few of the poorer Norman gentry might also be seen,  distinguished by their shaven chins and short cloaks, and not less so by their  keeping together, and looking with great scorn on the whole solemnity, even  while condescending to avail themselves of the good cheer which was so  liberally supplied.          Mendicants were of course assembled by the score, together with strolling  soldiers returned from Palestine, (according to their own account at least,)  pedlars were displaying their wares, travelling mechanics were enquiring after  employment, and wandering palmers, hedge-priests, Saxon minstrels, and Welsh  bards, were muttering prayers, and extracting mistuned dirges from their harps,  crowds, and rotes.   58            One sent forth the praises of Athelstane in a doleful panegyric; another, in a  Saxon genealogical poem, rehearsed the uncouth and harsh names of his noble  ancestry. Jesters and jugglers were not awanting, nor was the occasion of the  assembly supposed to render the exercise of their profession indecorous or  improper. Indeed the ideas of the Saxons on these occasions were as natural as  they were rude. If sorrow was thirsty, there was drink&mdash;if hungry, there  was food&mdash;if it sunk down upon and saddened the heart, here were the means  supplied of mirth, or at least of amusement. Nor did the assistants scorn to  avail themselves of those means of consolation, although, every now and then,  as if suddenly recollecting the cause which had brought them together, the men  groaned in unison, while the females, of whom many were present, raised up  their voices and shrieked for very woe.          Such was the scene in the castle-yard at Coningsburgh when it was entered by  Richard and his followers. The seneschal or steward deigned not to take notice  of the groups of inferior guests who were perpetually entering and withdrawing,  unless so far as was necessary to preserve order; nevertheless he was struck by  the good mien of the Monarch and Ivanhoe, more especially as he imagined the  features of the latter were familiar to him. Besides, the approach of two  knights, for such their dress bespoke them, was a rare event at a Saxon  solemnity, and could not but be regarded as a sort of honour to the deceased  and his family. And in his sable dress, and holding in his hand his white wand  of office, this important personage made way through the miscellaneous  assemblage of guests, thus conducting Richard and Ivanhoe to the entrance of  the tower. Gurth and Wamba speedily found acquaintances in the court-yard, nor  presumed to intrude themselves any farther until their presence should be  required.                     CHAPTER XLII        I found them winding of Marcello&rsquo;s corpse.   And there was such a solemn melody,   &rsquo;Twixt doleful songs, tears, and sad elegies,&mdash;   Such as old grandames, watching by the dead,   Are wont to outwear the night with.          O LD  P LAY           The mode of entering the great tower of Coningsburgh Castle is very peculiar,  and partakes of the rude simplicity of the early times in which it was erected.  A flight of steps, so deep and narrow as to be almost precipitous, leads up to  a low portal in the south side of the tower, by which the adventurous antiquary  may still, or at least could a few years since, gain access to a small stair  within the thickness of the main wall of the tower, which leads up to the third  story of the building,&mdash;the two lower being dungeons or vaults, which  neither receive air nor light, save by a square hole in the third story, with  which they seem to have communicated by a ladder. The access to the upper  apartments in the tower which consist in all of four stories, is given by  stairs which are carried up through the external buttresses.          By this difficult and complicated entrance, the good King Richard, followed by  his faithful Ivanhoe, was ushered into the round apartment which occupies the  whole of the third story from the ground. Wilfred, by the difficulties of the  ascent, gained time to muffle his face in his mantle, as it had been held  expedient that he should not present himself to his father until the King  should give him the signal.          There were assembled in this apartment, around a large oaken table, about a  dozen of the most distinguished representatives of the Saxon families in the  adjacent counties. They were all old, or, at least, elderly men; for the  younger race, to the great displeasure of the seniors, had, like Ivanhoe,  broken down many of the barriers which separated for half a century the Norman  victors from the vanquished Saxons. The downcast and sorrowful looks of these  venerable men, their silence and their mournful posture, formed a strong  contrast to the levity of the revellers on the outside of the castle. Their  grey locks and long full beards, together with their antique tunics and loose  black mantles, suited well with the singular and rude apartment in which they  were seated, and gave the appearance of a band of ancient worshippers of Woden,  recalled to life to mourn over the decay of their national glory.          Cedric, seated in equal rank among his countrymen, seemed yet, by common  consent, to act as chief of the assembly. Upon the entrance of Richard (only  known to him as the valorous Knight of the Fetterlock) he arose gravely, and  gave him welcome by the ordinary salutation, &ldquo;Waes hael&rdquo;, raising  at the same time a goblet to his head. The King, no stranger to the customs of  his English subjects, returned the greeting with the appropriate words,  &ldquo;Drinc hael&rdquo;, and partook of a cup which was handed to him by the  sewer. The same courtesy was offered to Ivanhoe, who pledged his father in  silence, supplying the usual speech by an inclination of his head, lest his  voice should have been recognised.          When this introductory ceremony was performed, Cedric arose, and, extending his  hand to Richard, conducted him into a small and very rude chapel, which was  excavated, as it were, out of one of the external buttresses. As there was no  opening, saving a little narrow loop-hole, the place would have been nearly  quite dark but for two flambeaux or torches, which showed, by a red and smoky  light, the arched roof and naked walls, the rude altar of stone, and the  crucifix of the same material.          Before this altar was placed a bier, and on each side of this bier kneeled  three priests, who told their beads, and muttered their prayers, with the  greatest signs of external devotion. For this service a splendid  &ldquo;soul-scat&rdquo; was paid to the convent of Saint Edmund&rsquo;s by the  mother of the deceased; and, that it might be fully deserved, the whole  brethren, saving the lame Sacristan, had transferred themselves to  Coningsburgh, where, while six of their number were constantly on guard in the  performance of divine rites by the bier of Athelstane, the others failed not to  take their share of the refreshments and amusements which went on at the  castle. In maintaining this pious watch and ward, the good monks were  particularly careful not to interrupt their hymns for an instant, lest  Zernebock, the ancient Saxon Apollyon, should lay his clutches on the departed  Athelstane. Nor were they less careful to prevent any unhallowed layman from  touching the pall, which, having been that used at the funeral of Saint Edmund,  was liable to be desecrated, if handled by the profane. If, in truth, these  attentions could be of any use to the deceased, he had some right to expect  them at the hands of the brethren of Saint Edmund&rsquo;s, since, besides a  hundred mancuses of gold paid down as the soul-ransom, the mother of Athelstane  had announced her intention of endowing that foundation with the better part of  the lands of the deceased, in order to maintain perpetual prayers for his soul,  and that of her departed husband. Richard and Wilfred followed the Saxon Cedric  into the apartment of death, where, as their guide pointed with solemn air to  the untimely bier of Athelstane, they followed his example in devoutly crossing  themselves, and muttering a brief prayer for the weal of the departed soul.          This act of pious charity performed, Cedric again motioned them to follow him,  gliding over the stone floor with a noiseless tread; and, after ascending a few  steps, opened with great caution the door of a small oratory, which adjoined to  the chapel. It was about eight feet square, hollowed, like the chapel itself,  out of the thickness of the wall; and the loop-hole, which enlightened it,  being to the west, and widening considerably as it sloped inward, a beam of the  setting sun found its way into its dark recess, and showed a female of a  dignified mien, and whose countenance retained the marked remains of majestic  beauty. Her long mourning robes and her flowing wimple of black cypress,  enhanced the whiteness of her skin, and the beauty of her light-coloured and  flowing tresses, which time had neither thinned nor mingled with silver. Her  countenance expressed the deepest sorrow that is consistent with resignation.  On the stone table before her stood a crucifix of ivory, beside which was laid  a missal, having its pages richly illuminated, and its boards adorned with  clasps of gold, and bosses of the same precious metal.          &ldquo;Noble Edith,&rdquo; said Cedric, after having stood a moment silent, as  if to give Richard and Wilfred time to look upon the lady of the mansion,  &ldquo;these are worthy strangers, come to take a part in thy sorrows. And  this, in especial, is the valiant Knight who fought so bravely for the  deliverance of him for whom we this day mourn.&rdquo;          &ldquo;His bravery has my thanks,&rdquo; returned the lady; &ldquo;although it  be the will of Heaven that it should be displayed in vain. I thank, too, his  courtesy, and that of his companion, which hath brought them hither to behold  the widow of Adeling, the mother of Athelstane, in her deep hour of sorrow and  lamentation. To your care, kind kinsman, I intrust them, satisfied that they  will want no hospitality which these sad walls can yet afford.&rdquo;          The guests bowed deeply to the mourning parent, and withdrew from their  hospitable guide.          Another winding stair conducted them to an apartment of the same size with that  which they had first entered, occupying indeed the story immediately above.  From this room, ere yet the door was opened, proceeded a low and melancholy  strain of vocal music. When they entered, they found themselves in the presence  of about twenty matrons and maidens of distinguished Saxon lineage. Four  maidens, Rowena leading the choir, raised a hymn for the soul of the deceased,  of which we have only been able to decipher two or three stanzas:&mdash;          Dust unto dust,   To this all must;   The tenant hath resign&rsquo;d   The faded form   To waste and worm&mdash;   Corruption claims her kind.      Through paths unknown   Thy soul hath flown,   To seek the realms of woe,   Where fiery pain   Shall purge the stain   Of actions done below.      In that sad place,   By Mary&rsquo;s grace,   Brief may thy dwelling be   Till prayers and alms,   And holy psalms,   Shall set the captive free.          While this dirge was sung, in a low and melancholy tone, by the female  choristers, the others were divided into two bands, of which one was engaged in  bedecking, with such embroidery as their skill and taste could compass, a large  silken pall, destined to cover the bier of Athelstane, while the others busied  themselves in selecting, from baskets of flowers placed before them, garlands,  which they intended for the same mournful purpose. The behaviour of the maidens  was decorous, if not marked with deep affliction; but now and then a whisper or  a smile called forth the rebuke of the severer matrons, and here and there  might be seen a damsel more interested in endeavouring to find out how her  mourning-robe became her, than in the dismal ceremony for which they were  preparing. Neither was this propensity (if we must needs confess the truth) at  all diminished by the appearance of two strange knights, which occasioned some  looking up, peeping, and whispering. Rowena alone, too proud to be vain, paid  her greeting to her deliverer with a graceful courtesy. Her demeanour was  serious, but not dejected; and it may be doubted whether thoughts of Ivanhoe,  and of the uncertainty of his fate, did not claim as great a share in her  gravity as the death of her kinsman.          To Cedric, however, who, as we have observed, was not remarkably clear-sighted  on such occasions, the sorrow of his ward seemed so much deeper than any of the  other maidens, that he deemed it proper to whisper the  explanation&mdash;&ldquo;She was the affianced bride of the noble  Athelstane.&rdquo;&mdash;It may be doubted whether this communication went a  far way to increase Wilfred&rsquo;s disposition to sympathize with the mourners  of Coningsburgh.          Having thus formally introduced the guests to the different chambers in which  the obsequies of Athelstane were celebrated under different forms, Cedric  conducted them into a small room, destined, as he informed them, for the  exclusive accomodation of honourable guests, whose more slight connexion with  the deceased might render them unwilling to join those who were immediately  effected by the unhappy event. He assured them of every accommodation, and was  about to withdraw when the Black Knight took his hand.          &ldquo;I crave to remind you, noble Thane,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that when we  last parted, you promised, for the service I had the fortune to render you, to  grant me a boon.&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is granted ere named, noble Knight,&rdquo; said Cedric; &ldquo;yet,  at this sad moment&mdash;-&rdquo;          &ldquo;Of that also,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;I have bethought me&mdash;but  my time is brief&mdash;neither does it seem to me unfit, that, when closing the  grave on the noble Athelstane, we should deposit therein certain prejudices and  hasty opinions.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Sir Knight of the Fetterlock,&rdquo; said Cedric, colouring, and  interrupting the King in his turn, &ldquo;I trust your boon regards yourself  and no other; for in that which concerns the honour of my house, it is scarce  fitting that a stranger should mingle.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nor do I wish to mingle,&rdquo; said the King, mildly, &ldquo;unless in  so far as you will admit me to have an interest. As yet you have known me but  as the Black Knight of the Fetterlock&mdash;Know me now as Richard  Plantagenet.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Richard of Anjou!&rdquo; exclaimed Cedric, stepping backward with the  utmost astonishment.          &ldquo;No, noble Cedric&mdash;Richard of England!&mdash;whose deepest  interest&mdash;whose deepest wish, is to see her sons united with each  other.&mdash;And, how now, worthy Thane! hast thou no knee for thy  prince?&rdquo;          &ldquo;To Norman blood,&rdquo; said Cedric, &ldquo;it hath never bended.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Reserve thine homage then,&rdquo; said the Monarch, &ldquo;until I shall  prove my right to it by my equal protection of Normans and English.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; answered Cedric, &ldquo;I have ever done justice to thy  bravery and thy worth&mdash;Nor am I ignorant of thy claim to the crown through  thy descent from Matilda, niece to Edgar Atheling, and daughter to Malcolm of  Scotland. But Matilda, though of the royal Saxon blood, was not the heir to the  monarchy.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I will not dispute my title with thee, noble Thane,&rdquo; said Richard,  calmly; &ldquo;but I will bid thee look around thee, and see where thou wilt  find another to be put into the scale against it.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And hast thou wandered hither, Prince, to tell me so?&rdquo; said  Cedric&mdash;&ldquo;To upbraid me with the ruin of my race, ere the grave has  closed o&rsquo;er the last scion of Saxon royalty?&rdquo;&mdash;His countenance  darkened as he spoke.&mdash;&ldquo;It was boldly&mdash;it was rashly  done!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Not so, by the holy rood!&rdquo; replied the King; &ldquo;it was done in  the frank confidence which one brave man may repose in another, without a  shadow of danger.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou sayest well, Sir King&mdash;for King I own thou art, and wilt be,  despite of my feeble opposition.&mdash;I dare not take the only mode to prevent  it, though thou hast placed the strong temptation within my reach!&rdquo;          &ldquo;And now to my boon,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;which I ask not with  one jot the less confidence, that thou hast refused to acknowledge my lawful  sovereignty. I require of thee, as a man of thy word, on pain of being held  faithless, man-sworn, and &lsquo;nidering&rsquo;,   581   to forgive  and receive to thy paternal affection the good knight, Wilfred of Ivanhoe. In  this reconciliation thou wilt own I have an interest&mdash;the happiness of my  friend, and the quelling of dissension among my faithful people.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And this is Wilfred!&rdquo; said Cedric, pointing to his son.          &ldquo;My father!&mdash;my father!&rdquo; said Ivanhoe, prostrating himself at  Cedric&rsquo;s feet, &ldquo;grant me thy forgiveness!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thou hast it, my son,&rdquo; said Cedric, raising him up. &ldquo;The son  of Hereward knows how to keep his word, even when it has been passed to a  Norman. But let me see thee use the dress and costume of thy English  ancestry&mdash;no short cloaks, no gay bonnets, no fantastic plumage in my  decent household. He that would be the son of Cedric, must show himself of  English ancestry.&mdash;Thou art about to speak,&rdquo; he added, sternly,  &ldquo;and I guess the topic. The Lady Rowena must complete two years&rsquo;  mourning, as for a betrothed husband&mdash;all our Saxon ancestors would disown  us were we to treat of a new union for her ere the grave of him she should have  wedded&mdash;him, so much the most worthy of her hand by birth and  ancestry&mdash;is yet closed. The ghost of Athelstane himself would burst his  bloody cerements and stand before us to forbid such dishonour to his  memory.&rdquo;          It seemed as if Cedric&rsquo;s words had raised a spectre; for, scarce had he  uttered them ere the door flew open, and Athelstane, arrayed in the garments of  the grave, stood before them, pale, haggard, and like something arisen from the  dead!   59            The effect of this apparition on the persons present was utterly appalling.  Cedric started back as far as the wall of the apartment would permit, and,  leaning against it as one unable to support himself, gazed on the figure of his  friend with eyes that seemed fixed, and a mouth which he appeared incapable of  shutting. Ivanhoe crossed himself, repeating prayers in Saxon, Latin, or  Norman-French, as they occurred to his memory, while Richard alternately said,  &ldquo;Benedicite&rdquo;, and swore, &ldquo;Mort de ma vie!&rdquo;          In the meantime, a horrible noise was heard below stairs, some crying,  &ldquo;Secure the treacherous monks!&rdquo;&mdash;others, &ldquo;Down with them  into the dungeon!&rdquo;&mdash;others, &ldquo;Pitch them from the highest  battlements!&rdquo;          &ldquo;In the name of God!&rdquo; said Cedric, addressing what seemed the  spectre of his departed friend, &ldquo;if thou art mortal, speak!&mdash;if a  departed spirit, say for what cause thou dost revisit us, or if I can do aught  that can set thy spirit at repose.&mdash;Living or dead, noble Athelstane,  speak to Cedric!&rdquo;          &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said the spectre, very composedly, &ldquo;when I have  collected breath, and when you give me time&mdash;Alive, saidst thou?&mdash;I  am as much alive as he can be who has fed on bread and water for three days,  which seem three ages&mdash;Yes, bread and water, Father Cedric! By Heaven, and  all saints in it, better food hath not passed my weasand for three livelong  days, and by God&rsquo;s providence it is that I am now here to tell it.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Why, noble Athelstane,&rdquo; said the Black Knight, &ldquo;I myself saw  you struck down by the fierce Templar towards the end of the storm at  Torquilstone, and as I thought, and Wamba reported, your skull was cloven  through the teeth.&rdquo;          &ldquo;You thought amiss, Sir Knight,&rdquo; said Athelstane, &ldquo;and Wamba  lied. My teeth are in good order, and that my supper shall presently  find&mdash;No thanks to the Templar though, whose sword turned in his hand, so  that the blade struck me flatlings, being averted by the handle of the good  mace with which I warded the blow; had my steel-cap been on, I had not valued  it a rush, and had dealt him such a counter-buff as would have spoilt his  retreat. But as it was, down I went, stunned, indeed, but unwounded. Others, of  both sides, were beaten down and slaughtered above me, so that I never  recovered my senses until I found myself in a coffin&mdash;(an open one, by  good luck)&mdash;placed before the altar of the church of Saint Edmund&rsquo;s.  I sneezed repeatedly&mdash;groaned&mdash;awakened and would have arisen, when  the Sacristan and Abbot, full of terror, came running at the noise, surprised,  doubtless, and no way pleased to find the man alive, whose heirs they had  proposed themselves to be. I asked for wine&mdash;they gave me some, but it  must have been highly medicated, for I slept yet more deeply than before, and  wakened not for many hours. I found my arms swathed down&mdash;my feet tied so  fast that mine ankles ache at the very remembrance&mdash;the place was utterly  dark&mdash;the oubliette, as I suppose, of their accursed convent, and from the  close, stifled, damp smell, I conceive it is also used for a place of  sepulture. I had strange thoughts of what had befallen me, when the door of my  dungeon creaked, and two villain monks entered. They would have persuaded me I  was in purgatory, but I knew too well the pursy short-breathed voice of the  Father Abbot.&mdash;Saint Jeremy! how different from that tone with which he  used to ask me for another slice of the haunch!&mdash;the dog has feasted with  me from Christmas to Twelfth-night.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Have patience, noble Athelstane,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;take  breath&mdash;tell your story at leisure&mdash;beshrew me but such a tale is as  well worth listening to as a romance.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay but, by the rood of Bromeholm, there was no romance in the  matter!&rdquo; said Athelstane.&mdash;&ldquo;A barley loaf and a pitcher of  water&mdash;that THEY gave me, the niggardly traitors, whom my father, and I  myself, had enriched, when their best resources were the flitches of bacon and  measures of corn, out of which they wheedled poor serfs and bondsmen, in  exchange for their prayers&mdash;the nest of foul ungrateful  vipers&mdash;barley bread and ditch water to such a patron as I had been! I  will smoke them out of their nest, though I be excommunicated!&rdquo;          &ldquo;But, in the name of Our Lady, noble Athelstane,&rdquo; said Cedric,  grasping the hand of his friend, &ldquo;how didst thou escape this imminent  danger&mdash;did their hearts relent?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Did their hearts relent!&rdquo; echoed Athelstane.&mdash;&ldquo;Do rocks  melt with the sun? I should have been there still, had not some stir in the  Convent, which I find was their procession hitherward to eat my funeral feast,  when they well knew how and where I had been buried alive, summoned the swarm  out of their hive. I heard them droning out their death-psalms, little judging  they were sung in respect for my soul by those who were thus famishing my body.  They went, however, and I waited long for food&mdash;no wonder&mdash;the gouty  Sacristan was even too busy with his own provender to mind mine. At length down  he came, with an unstable step and a strong flavour of wine and spices about  his person. Good cheer had opened his heart, for he left me a nook of pasty and  a flask of wine, instead of my former fare. I ate, drank, and was invigorated;  when, to add to my good luck, the Sacristan, too totty to discharge his duty of  turnkey fitly, locked the door beside the staple, so that it fell ajar. The  light, the food, the wine, set my invention to work. The staple to which my  chains were fixed, was more rusted than I or the villain Abbot had supposed.  Even iron could not remain without consuming in the damps of that infernal  dungeon.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Take breath, noble Athelstane,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;and partake  of some refreshment, ere you proceed with a tale so dreadful.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Partake!&rdquo; quoth Athelstane; &ldquo;I have been partaking five  times to-day&mdash;and yet a morsel of that savoury ham were not altogether  foreign to the matter; and I pray you, fair sir, to do me reason in a cup of  wine.&rdquo;          The guests, though still agape with astonishment, pledged their resuscitated  landlord, who thus proceeded in his story:&mdash;He had indeed now many more  auditors than those to whom it was commenced, for Edith, having given certain  necessary orders for arranging matters within the Castle, had followed the  dead-alive up to the stranger&rsquo;s apartment attended by as many of the  guests, male and female, as could squeeze into the small room, while others,  crowding the staircase, caught up an erroneous edition of the story, and  transmitted it still more inaccurately to those beneath, who again sent it  forth to the vulgar without, in a fashion totally irreconcilable to the real  fact. Athelstane, however, went on as follows, with the history of his  escape:&mdash;          &ldquo;Finding myself freed from the staple, I dragged myself up stairs as well  as a man loaded with shackles, and emaciated with fasting, might; and after  much groping about, I was at length directed, by the sound of a jolly  roundelay, to the apartment where the worthy Sacristan, an it so please ye, was  holding a devil&rsquo;s mass with a huge beetle-browed, broad-shouldered  brother of the grey-frock and cowl, who looked much more like a thief than a  clergyman. I burst in upon them, and the fashion of my grave-clothes, as well  as the clanking of my chains, made me more resemble an inhabitant of the other  world than of this. Both stood aghast; but when I knocked down the Sacristan  with my fist, the other fellow, his pot-companion, fetched a blow at me with a  huge quarter-staff.&rdquo;          &ldquo;This must be our Friar Tuck, for a count&rsquo;s ransom,&rdquo; said  Richard, looking at Ivanhoe.          &ldquo;He may be the devil, an he will,&rdquo; said Athelstane.  &ldquo;Fortunately he missed the aim; and on my approaching to grapple with  him, took to his heels and ran for it. I failed not to set my own heels at  liberty by means of the fetter-key, which hung amongst others at the  sexton&rsquo;s belt; and I had thoughts of beating out the knave&rsquo;s brains  with the bunch of keys, but gratitude for the nook of pasty and the flask of  wine which the rascal had imparted to my captivity, came over my heart; so,  with a brace of hearty kicks, I left him on the floor, pouched some baked meat,  and a leathern bottle of wine, with which the two venerable brethren had been  regaling, went to the stable, and found in a private stall mine own best  palfrey, which, doubtless, had been set apart for the holy Father Abbot&rsquo;s  particular use. Hither I came with all the speed the beast could  compass&mdash;man and mother&rsquo;s son flying before me wherever I came,  taking me for a spectre, the more especially as, to prevent my being  recognised, I drew the corpse-hood over my face. I had not gained admittance  into my own castle, had I not been supposed to be the attendant of a juggler  who is making the people in the castle-yard very merry, considering they are  assembled to celebrate their lord&rsquo;s funeral&mdash;I say the sewer thought  I was dressed to bear a part in the tregetour&rsquo;s mummery, and so I got  admission, and did but disclose myself to my mother, and eat a hasty morsel,  ere I came in quest of you, my noble friend.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And you have found me,&rdquo; said Cedric, &ldquo;ready to resume our  brave projects of honour and liberty. I tell thee, never will dawn a morrow so  auspicious as the next, for the deliverance of the noble Saxon race.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Talk not to me of delivering any one,&rdquo; said Athelstane; &ldquo;it  is well I am delivered myself. I am more intent on punishing that villain  Abbot. He shall hang on the top of this Castle of Coningsburgh, in his cope and  stole; and if the stairs be too strait to admit his fat carcass, I will have  him craned up from without.&rdquo;          &ldquo;But, my son,&rdquo; said Edith, &ldquo;consider his sacred  office.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Consider my three days&rsquo; fast,&rdquo; replied Athelstane; &ldquo;I  will have their blood every one of them. Front-de-Bœuf was burnt alive for a  less matter, for he kept a good table for his prisoners, only put too much  garlic in his last dish of pottage. But these hypocritical, ungrateful slaves,  so often the self-invited flatterers at my board, who gave me neither pottage  nor garlic, more or less, they die, by the soul of Hengist!&rdquo;          &ldquo;But the Pope, my noble friend,&rdquo;&mdash;said Cedric&mdash;          &ldquo;But the devil, my noble friend,&rdquo;&mdash;answered Athelstane;  &ldquo;they die, and no more of them. Were they the best monks upon earth, the  world would go on without them.&rdquo;          &ldquo;For shame, noble Athelstane,&rdquo; said Cedric; &ldquo;forget such  wretches in the career of glory which lies open before thee. Tell this Norman  prince, Richard of Anjou, that, lion-hearted as he is, he shall not hold  undisputed the throne of Alfred, while a male descendant of the Holy Confessor  lives to dispute it.&rdquo;          &ldquo;How!&rdquo; said Athelstane, &ldquo;is this the noble King  Richard?&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is Richard Plantagenet himself,&rdquo; said Cedric; &ldquo;yet I need  not remind thee that, coming hither a guest of free-will, he may neither be  injured nor detained prisoner&mdash;thou well knowest thy duty to him as his  host.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay, by my faith!&rdquo; said Athelstane; &ldquo;and my duty as a subject  besides, for I here tender him my allegiance, heart and hand.&rdquo;          &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said Edith, &ldquo;think on thy royal rights!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Think on the freedom of England, degenerate Prince!&rdquo; said Cedric.          &ldquo;Mother and friend,&rdquo; said Athelstane, &ldquo;a truce to your  upbraidings&mdash;bread and water and a dungeon are marvellous mortifiers of  ambition, and I rise from the tomb a wiser man than I descended into it. One  half of those vain follies were puffed into mine ear by that perfidious Abbot  Wolfram, and you may now judge if he is a counsellor to be trusted. Since these  plots were set in agitation, I have had nothing but hurried journeys,  indigestions, blows and bruises, imprisonments and starvation; besides that  they can only end in the murder of some thousands of quiet folk. I tell you, I  will be king in my own domains, and nowhere else; and my first act of dominion  shall be to hang the Abbot.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And my ward Rowena,&rdquo; said Cedric&mdash;&ldquo;I trust you intend  not to desert her?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Father Cedric,&rdquo; said Athelstane, &ldquo;be reasonable. The Lady  Rowena cares not for me&mdash;she loves the little finger of my kinsman  Wilfred&rsquo;s glove better than my whole person. There she stands to avouch  it&mdash;Nay, blush not, kinswoman, there is no shame in loving a courtly  knight better than a country franklin&mdash;and do not laugh neither, Rowena,  for grave-clothes and a thin visage are, God knows, no matter of  merriment&mdash;Nay, an thou wilt needs laugh, I will find thee a better  jest&mdash;Give me thy hand, or rather lend it me, for I but ask it in the way  of friendship.&mdash;Here, cousin Wilfred of Ivanhoe, in thy favour I renounce  and abjure&mdash;-Hey! by Saint Dunstan, our cousin Wilfred hath  vanished!&mdash;Yet, unless my eyes are still dazzled with the fasting I have  undergone, I saw him stand there but even now.&rdquo;          All now looked around and enquired for Ivanhoe, but he had vanished. It was at  length discovered that a Jew had been to seek him; and that, after very brief  conference, he had called for Gurth and his armour, and had left the castle.          &ldquo;Fair cousin,&rdquo; said Athelstane to Rowena, &ldquo;could I think that  this sudden disappearance of Ivanhoe was occasioned by other than the  weightiest reason, I would myself resume&mdash;&rdquo;          But he had no sooner let go her hand, on first observing that Ivanhoe had  disappeared, than Rowena, who had found her situation extremely embarrassing,  had taken the first opportunity to escape from the apartment.          &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; quoth Athelstane, &ldquo;women are the least to be  trusted of all animals, monks and abbots excepted. I am an infidel, if I  expected not thanks from her, and perhaps a kiss to boot&mdash;These cursed  grave-clothes have surely a spell on them, every one flies from me.&mdash;To  you I turn, noble King Richard, with the vows of allegiance, which, as a  liege-subject&mdash;&rdquo;          But King Richard was gone also, and no one knew whither. At length it was  learned that he had hastened to the court-yard, summoned to his presence the  Jew who had spoken with Ivanhoe, and after a moment&rsquo;s speech with him,  had called vehemently to horse, thrown himself upon a steed, compelled the Jew  to mount another, and set off at a rate, which, according to Wamba, rendered  the old Jew&rsquo;s neck not worth a penny&rsquo;s purchase.          &ldquo;By my halidome!&rdquo; said Athelstane, &ldquo;it is certain that  Zernebock hath possessed himself of my castle in my absence. I return in my  grave-clothes, a pledge restored from the very sepulchre, and every one I speak  to vanishes as soon as they hear my voice!&mdash;But it skills not talking of  it. Come, my friends&mdash;such of you as are left, follow me to the  banquet-hall, lest any more of us disappear&mdash;it is, I trust, as yet  tolerably furnished, as becomes the obsequies of an ancient Saxon noble; and  should we tarry any longer, who knows but the devil may fly off with the  supper?&rdquo;                     CHAPTER XLIII        Be Mowbray&rsquo;s sins so heavy in his bosom,   That they may break his foaming courser&rsquo;s back,   And throw the rider headlong in the lists,   A caitiff recreant!          R ICHARD  II          Our scene now returns to the exterior of the Castle, or Preceptory, of  Templestowe, about the hour when the bloody die was to be cast for the life or  death of Rebecca. It was a scene of bustle and life, as if the whole vicinity  had poured forth its inhabitants to a village wake, or rural feast. But the  earnest desire to look on blood and death, is not peculiar to those dark ages;  though in the gladiatorial exercise of single combat and general tourney, they  were habituated to the bloody spectacle of brave men falling by each  other&rsquo;s hands. Even in our own days, when morals are better understood,  an execution, a bruising match, a riot, or a meeting of radical reformers,  collects, at considerable hazard to themselves, immense crowds of spectators,  otherwise little interested, except to see how matters are to be conducted, or  whether the heroes of the day are, in the heroic language of insurgent tailors,  flints or dunghills.          The eyes, therefore, of a very considerable multitude, were bent on the gate of  the Preceptory of Templestowe, with the purpose of witnessing the procession;  while still greater numbers had already surrounded the tiltyard belonging to  that establishment. This enclosure was formed on a piece of level ground  adjoining to the Preceptory, which had been levelled with care, for the  exercise of military and chivalrous sports. It occupied the brow of a soft and  gentle eminence, was carefully palisaded around, and, as the Templars willingly  invited spectators to be witnesses of their skill in feats of chivalry, was  amply supplied with galleries and benches for their use.          On the present occasion, a throne was erected for the Grand Master at the east  end, surrounded with seats of distinction for the Preceptors and Knights of the  Order. Over these floated the sacred standard, called &ldquo;Le  Beau-seant&rdquo;, which was the ensign, as its name was the battle-cry, of the  Templars.          At the opposite end of the lists was a pile of faggots, so arranged around a  stake, deeply fixed in the ground, as to leave a space for the victim whom they  were destined to consume, to enter within the fatal circle, in order to be  chained to the stake by the fetters which hung ready for that purpose. Beside  this deadly apparatus stood four black slaves, whose colour and African  features, then so little known in England, appalled the multitude, who gazed on  them as on demons employed about their own diabolical exercises. These men  stirred not, excepting now and then, under the direction of one who seemed  their chief, to shift and replace the ready fuel. They looked not on the  multitude. In fact, they seemed insensible of their presence, and of every  thing save the discharge of their own horrible duty.          And when, in speech with each other, they expanded their blubber lips, and  showed their white fangs, as if they grinned at the thoughts of the expected  tragedy, the startled commons could scarcely help believing that they were  actually the familiar spirits with whom the witch had communed, and who, her  time being out, stood ready to assist in her dreadful punishment. They  whispered to each other, and communicated all the feats which Satan had  performed during that busy and unhappy period, not failing, of course, to give  the devil rather more than his due.          &ldquo;Have you not heard, Father Dennet,&rdquo; quoth one boor to another  advanced in years, &ldquo;that the devil has carried away bodily the great  Saxon Thane, Athelstane of Coningsburgh?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay, but he brought him back though, by the blessing of God and Saint  Dunstan.&rdquo;          &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said a brisk young fellow, dressed in a green  cassock embroidered with gold, and having at his heels a stout lad bearing a  harp upon his back, which betrayed his vocation. The Minstrel seemed of no  vulgar rank; for, besides the splendour of his gaily braidered doublet, he wore  around his neck a silver chain, by which hung the &ldquo;wrest&rdquo;, or key,  with which he tuned his harp. On his right arm was a silver plate, which,  instead of bearing, as usual, the cognizance or badge of the baron to whose  family he belonged, had barely the word SHERWOOD engraved upon  it.&mdash;&ldquo;How mean you by that?&rdquo; said the gay Minstrel, mingling  in the conversation of the peasants; &ldquo;I came to seek one subject for my  rhyme, and, by&rsquo;r Lady, I were glad to find two.&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is well avouched,&rdquo; said the elder peasant, &ldquo;that after  Athelstane of Coningsburgh had been dead four weeks&mdash;&rdquo;          &ldquo;That is impossible,&rdquo; said the Minstrel; &ldquo;I saw him in life  at the Passage of Arms at Ashby-de-la-Zouche.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Dead, however, he was, or else translated,&rdquo; said the younger  peasant; &ldquo;for I heard the Monks of Saint Edmund&rsquo;s singing the  death&rsquo;s hymn for him; and, moreover, there was a rich death-meal and dole  at the Castle of Coningsburgh, as right was; and thither had I gone, but for  Mabel Parkins, who&mdash;&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ay, dead was Athelstane,&rdquo; said the old man, shaking his head,  &ldquo;and the more pity it was, for the old Saxon blood&mdash;&rdquo;          &ldquo;But, your story, my masters&mdash;your story,&rdquo; said the Minstrel,  somewhat impatiently.          &ldquo;Ay, ay&mdash;construe us the story,&rdquo; said a burly Friar, who stood  beside them, leaning on a pole that exhibited an appearance between a  pilgrim&rsquo;s staff and a quarter-staff, and probably acted as either when  occasion served,&mdash;&ldquo;Your story,&rdquo; said the stalwart churchman;  &ldquo;burn not daylight about it&mdash;we have short time to spare.&rdquo;          &ldquo;An please your reverence,&rdquo; said Dennet, &ldquo;a drunken priest  came to visit the Sacristan at Saint Edmund&rsquo;s&mdash;-&rdquo;          &ldquo;It does not please my reverence,&rdquo; answered the churchman,  &ldquo;that there should be such an animal as a drunken priest, or, if there  were, that a layman should so speak him. Be mannerly, my friend, and conclude  the holy man only wrapt in meditation, which makes the head dizzy and foot  unsteady, as if the stomach were filled with new wine&mdash;I have felt it  myself.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; answered Father Dennet, &ldquo;a holy brother came to  visit the Sacristan at Saint Edmund&rsquo;s&mdash;a sort of hedge-priest is the  visitor, and kills half the deer that are stolen in the forest, who loves the  tinkling of a pint-pot better than the sacring-bell, and deems a flitch of  bacon worth ten of his breviary; for the rest, a good fellow and a merry, who  will flourish a quarter-staff, draw a bow, and dance a Cheshire round, with  e&rsquo;er a man in Yorkshire.&rdquo;          &ldquo;That last part of thy speech, Dennet,&rdquo; said the Minstrel,  &ldquo;has saved thee a rib or twain.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Tush, man, I fear him not,&rdquo; said Dennet; &ldquo;I am somewhat old  and stiff, but when I fought for the bell and ram at Doncaster&mdash;&rdquo;          &ldquo;But the story&mdash;the story, my friend,&rdquo; again said the  Minstrel.          &ldquo;Why, the tale is but this&mdash;Athelstane of Coningsburgh was buried at  Saint Edmund&rsquo;s.&rdquo;          &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie, and a loud one,&rdquo; said the Friar, &ldquo;for I  saw him borne to his own Castle of Coningsburgh.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay, then, e&rsquo;en tell the story yourself, my masters,&rdquo; said  Dennet, turning sulky at these repeated contradictions; and it was with some  difficulty that the boor could be prevailed on, by the request of his comrade  and the Minstrel, to renew his tale.&mdash;&ldquo;These two &lsquo;sober&rsquo;  friars,&rdquo; said he at length, &ldquo;since this reverend man will needs  have them such, had continued drinking good ale, and wine, and what not, for  the best part for a summer&rsquo;s day, when they were aroused by a deep groan,  and a clanking of chains, and the figure of the deceased Athelstane entered the  apartment, saying, &lsquo;Ye evil shep-herds!&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is false,&rdquo; said the Friar, hastily, &ldquo;he never spoke a  word.&rdquo;          &ldquo;So ho! Friar Tuck,&rdquo; said the Minstrel, drawing him apart from the  rustics; &ldquo;we have started a new hare, I find.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I tell thee, Allan-a-Dale,&rdquo; said the Hermit, &ldquo;I saw  Athelstane of Coningsburgh as much as bodily eyes ever saw a living man. He had  his shroud on, and all about him smelt of the sepulchre&mdash;A butt of sack  will not wash it out of my memory.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; answered the Minstrel; &ldquo;thou dost but jest with  me!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Never believe me,&rdquo; said the Friar, &ldquo;an I fetched not a knock  at him with my quarter-staff that would have felled an ox, and it glided  through his body as it might through a pillar of smoke!&rdquo;          &ldquo;By Saint Hubert,&rdquo; said the Minstrel, &ldquo;but it is a wondrous  tale, and fit to be put in metre to the ancient tune, &lsquo;Sorrow came to the  old Friar.&rsquo;&rdquo;          &ldquo;Laugh, if ye list,&rdquo; said Friar Tuck; &ldquo;but an ye catch me  singing on such a theme, may the next ghost or devil carry me off with him  headlong! No, no&mdash;I instantly formed the purpose of assisting at some good  work, such as the burning of a witch, a judicial combat, or the like matter of  godly service, and therefore am I here.&rdquo;          As they thus conversed, the heavy bell of the church of Saint Michael of  Templestowe, a venerable building, situated in a hamlet at some distance from  the Preceptory, broke short their argument. One by one the sullen sounds fell  successively on the ear, leaving but sufficient space for each to die away in  distant echo, ere the air was again filled by repetition of the iron knell.  These sounds, the signal of the approaching ceremony, chilled with awe the  hearts of the assembled multitude, whose eyes were now turned to the  Preceptory, expecting the approach of the Grand Master, the champion, and the  criminal.          At length the drawbridge fell, the gates opened, and a knight, bearing the  great standard of the Order, sallied from the castle, preceded by six trumpets,  and followed by the Knights Preceptors, two and two, the Grand Master coming  last, mounted on a stately horse, whose furniture was of the simplest kind.  Behind him came Brian de Bois-Guilbert, armed cap-a-pie in bright armour, but  without his lance, shield, and sword, which were borne by his two esquires  behind him. His face, though partly hidden by a long plume which floated down  from his barrel-cap, bore a strong and mingled expression of passion, in which  pride seemed to contend with irresolution. He looked ghastly pale, as if he had  not slept for several nights, yet reined his pawing war-horse with the habitual  ease and grace proper to the best lance of the Order of the Temple. His general  appearance was grand and commanding; but, looking at him with attention, men  read that in his dark features, from which they willingly withdrew their eyes.          On either side rode Conrade of Mont-Fitchet, and Albert de Malvoisin, who acted  as godfathers to the champion. They were in their robes of peace, the white  dress of the Order. Behind them followed other Companions of the Temple, with a  long train of esquires and pages clad in black, aspirants to the honour of  being one day Knights of the Order. After these neophytes came a guard of  warders on foot, in the same sable livery, amidst whose partisans might be seen  the pale form of the accused, moving with a slow but undismayed step towards  the scene of her fate. She was stript of all her ornaments, lest perchance  there should be among them some of those amulets which Satan was supposed to  bestow upon his victims, to deprive them of the power of confession even when  under the torture. A coarse white dress, of the simplest form, had been  substituted for her Oriental garments; yet there was such an exquisite mixture  of courage and resignation in her look, that even in this garb, and with no  other ornament than her long black tresses, each eye wept that looked upon her,  and the most hardened bigot regretted the fate that had converted a creature so  goodly into a vessel of wrath, and a waged slave of the devil.          A crowd of inferior personages belonging to the Preceptory followed the victim,  all moving with the utmost order, with arms folded, and looks bent upon the  ground.          This slow procession moved up the gentle eminence, on the summit of which was  the tiltyard, and, entering the lists, marched once around them from right to  left, and when they had completed the circle, made a halt. There was then a  momentary bustle, while the Grand Master and all his attendants, excepting the  champion and his godfathers, dismounted from their horses, which were  immediately removed out of the lists by the esquires, who were in attendance  for that purpose.          The unfortunate Rebecca was conducted to the black chair placed near the pile.  On her first glance at the terrible spot where preparations were making for a  death alike dismaying to the mind and painful to the body, she was observed to  shudder and shut her eyes, praying internally doubtless, for her lips moved  though no speech was heard. In the space of a minute she opened her eyes,  looked fixedly on the pile as if to familiarize her mind with the object, and  then slowly and naturally turned away her head.          Meanwhile, the Grand Master had assumed his seat; and when the chivalry of his  order was placed around and behind him, each in his due rank, a loud and long  flourish of the trumpets announced that the Court were seated for judgment.  Malvoisin, then, acting as godfather of the champion, stepped forward, and laid  the glove of the Jewess, which was the pledge of battle, at the feet of the  Grand Master.          &ldquo;Valorous Lord, and reverend Father,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;here standeth  the good Knight, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, Knight Preceptor of the Order of the  Temple, who, by accepting the pledge of battle which I now lay at your  reverence&rsquo;s feet, hath become bound to do his devoir in combat this day,  to maintain that this Jewish maiden, by name Rebecca, hath justly deserved the  doom passed upon her in a Chapter of this most Holy Order of the Temple of  Zion, condemning her to die as a sorceress;&mdash;here, I say, he standeth,  such battle to do, knightly and honourable, if such be your noble and  sanctified pleasure.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Hath he made oath,&rdquo; said the Grand Master, &ldquo;that his quarrel  is just and honourable? Bring forward the Crucifix and the &lsquo;Te  igitur&rsquo;.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Sir, and most reverend father,&rdquo; answered Malvoisin, readily,  &ldquo;our brother here present hath already sworn to the truth of his  accusation in the hand of the good Knight Conrade de Mont-Fitchet; and  otherwise he ought not to be sworn, seeing that his adversary is an unbeliever,  and may take no oath.&rdquo;          This explanation was satisfactory, to Albert&rsquo;s great joy; for the wily  knight had foreseen the great difficulty, or rather impossibility, of  prevailing upon Brian de Bois-Guilbert to take such an oath before the  assembly, and had invented this excuse to escape the necessity of his doing so.          The Grand Master, having allowed the apology of Albert Malvoisin, commanded the  herald to stand forth and do his devoir. The trumpets then again flourished,  and a herald, stepping forward, proclaimed aloud,&mdash;&ldquo;Oyez, oyez,  oyez.&mdash;Here standeth the good Knight, Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert, ready to  do battle with any knight of free blood, who will sustain the quarrel allowed  and allotted to the Jewess Rebecca, to try by champion, in respect of lawful  essoine of her own body; and to such champion the reverend and valorous Grand  Master here present allows a fair field, and equal partition of sun and wind,  and whatever else appertains to a fair combat.&rdquo; The trumpets again  sounded, and there was a dead pause of many minutes.          &ldquo;No champion appears for the appellant,&rdquo; said the Grand Master.  &ldquo;Go, herald, and ask her whether she expects any one to do battle for her  in this her cause.&rdquo; The herald went to the chair in which Rebecca was  seated, and Bois-Guilbert suddenly turning his horse&rsquo;s head toward that  end of the lists, in spite of hints on either side from Malvoisin and  Mont-Fitchet, was by the side of Rebecca&rsquo;s chair as soon as the herald.          &ldquo;Is this regular, and according to the law of combat?&rdquo; said  Malvoisin, looking to the Grand Master.          &ldquo;Albert de Malvoisin, it is,&rdquo; answered Beaumanoir; &ldquo;for in  this appeal to the judgment of God, we may not prohibit parties from having  that communication with each other, which may best tend to bring forth the  truth of the quarrel.&rdquo;          In the meantime, the herald spoke to Rebecca in these  terms:&mdash;&ldquo;Damsel, the Honourable and Reverend the Grand Master  demands of thee, if thou art prepared with a champion to do battle this day in  thy behalf, or if thou dost yield thee as one justly condemned to a deserved  doom?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Say to the Grand Master,&rdquo; replied Rebecca, &ldquo;that I maintain  my innocence, and do not yield me as justly condemned, lest I become guilty of  mine own blood. Say to him, that I challenge such delay as his forms will  permit, to see if God, whose opportunity is in man&rsquo;s extremity, will  raise me up a deliverer; and when such uttermost space is passed, may His holy  will be done!&rdquo; The herald retired to carry this answer to the Grand  Master.          &ldquo;God forbid,&rdquo; said Lucas Beaumanoir, &ldquo;that Jew or Pagan  should impeach us of injustice!&mdash;Until the shadows be cast from the west  to the eastward, will we wait to see if a champion shall appear for this  unfortunate woman. When the day is so far passed, let her prepare for  death.&rdquo;          The herald communicated the words of the Grand Master to Rebecca, who bowed her  head submissively, folded her arms, and, looking up towards heaven, seemed to  expect that aid from above which she could scarce promise herself from man.  During this awful pause, the voice of Bois-Guilbert broke upon her ear&mdash;it  was but a whisper, yet it startled her more than the summons of the herald had  appeared to do.          &ldquo;Rebecca,&rdquo; said the Templar, &ldquo;dost thou hear me?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I have no portion in thee, cruel, hard-hearted man,&rdquo; said the  unfortunate maiden.          &ldquo;Ay, but dost thou understand my words?&rdquo; said the Templar;  &ldquo;for the sound of my voice is frightful in mine own ears. I scarce know  on what ground we stand, or for what purpose they have brought us  hither.&mdash;This listed space&mdash;that chair&mdash;these faggots&mdash;I  know their purpose, and yet it appears to me like something unreal&mdash;the  fearful picture of a vision, which appals my sense with hideous fantasies, but  convinces not my reason.&rdquo;          &ldquo;My mind and senses keep touch and time,&rdquo; answered Rebecca,  &ldquo;and tell me alike that these faggots are destined to consume my earthly  body, and open a painful but a brief passage to a better world.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Dreams, Rebecca,&mdash;dreams,&rdquo; answered the Templar; &ldquo;idle  visions, rejected by the wisdom of your own wiser Sadducees. Hear me,  Rebecca,&rdquo; he said, proceeding with animation; &ldquo;a better chance hast  thou for life and liberty than yonder knaves and dotard dream of. Mount thee  behind me on my steed&mdash;on Zamor, the gallant horse that never failed his  rider. I won him in single fight from the Soldan of Trebizond&mdash;mount, I  say, behind me&mdash;in one short hour is pursuit and enquiry far  behind&mdash;a new world of pleasure opens to thee&mdash;to me a new career of  fame. Let them speak the doom which I despise, and erase the name of  Bois-Guilbert from their list of monastic slaves! I will wash out with blood  whatever blot they may dare to cast on my scutcheon.&rdquo;                      &ldquo;Tempter,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;begone!&mdash;Not in this last  extremity canst thou move me one hair&rsquo;s-breadth from my resting  place&mdash;surrounded as I am by foes, I hold thee as my worst and most deadly  enemy&mdash;avoid thee, in the name of God!&rdquo;          Albert Malvoisin, alarmed and impatient at the duration of their conference,  now advanced to interrupt it.          &ldquo;Hath the maiden acknowledged her guilt?&rdquo; he demanded of  Bois-Guilbert; &ldquo;or is she resolute in her denial?&rdquo;          &ldquo;She is indeed resolute,&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert.          &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Malvoisin, &ldquo;must thou, noble brother, resume thy  place to attend the issue&mdash;The shades are changing on the circle of the  dial&mdash;Come, brave Bois-Guilbert&mdash;come, thou hope of our holy Order,  and soon to be its head.&rdquo;          As he spoke in this soothing tone, he laid his hand on the knight&rsquo;s  bridle, as if to lead him back to his station.          &ldquo;False villain! what meanest thou by thy hand on my rein?&rdquo; said Sir  Brian, angrily. And shaking off his companion&rsquo;s grasp, he rode back to  the upper end of the lists.          &ldquo;There is yet spirit in him,&rdquo; said Malvoisin apart to Mont-Fitchet,  &ldquo;were it well directed&mdash;but, like the Greek fire, it burns whatever  approaches it.&rdquo;          The Judges had now been two hours in the lists, awaiting in vain the appearance  of a champion.          &ldquo;And reason good,&rdquo; said Friar Tuck, &ldquo;seeing she is a  Jewess&mdash;and yet, by mine Order, it is hard that so young and beautiful a  creature should perish without one blow being struck in her behalf! Were she  ten times a witch, provided she were but the least bit of a Christian, my  quarter-staff should ring noon on the steel cap of yonder fierce Templar, ere  he carried the matter off thus.&rdquo;          It was, however, the general belief that no one could or would appear for a  Jewess, accused of sorcery; and the knights, instigated by Malvoisin, whispered  to each other, that it was time to declare the pledge of Rebecca forfeited. At  this instant a knight, urging his horse to speed, appeared on the plain  advancing towards the lists. A hundred voices exclaimed, &ldquo;A champion! a  champion!&rdquo; And despite the prepossessions and prejudices of the  multitude, they shouted unanimously as the knight rode into the tiltyard. The  second glance, however, served to destroy the hope that his timely arrival had  excited. His horse, urged for many miles to its utmost speed, appeared to reel  from fatigue, and the rider, however undauntedly he presented himself in the  lists, either from weakness, weariness, or both, seemed scarce able to support  himself in the saddle.          To the summons of the herald, who demanded his rank, his name, and purpose, the  stranger knight answered readily and boldly, &ldquo;I am a good knight and  noble, come hither to sustain with lance and sword the just and lawful quarrel  of this damsel, Rebecca, daughter of Isaac of York; to uphold the doom  pronounced against her to be false and truthless, and to defy Sir Brian de  Bois-Guilbert, as a traitor, murderer, and liar; as I will prove in this field  with my body against his, by the aid of God, of Our Lady, and of Monseigneur  Saint George, the good knight.&rdquo;          &ldquo;The stranger must first show,&rdquo; said Malvoisin, &ldquo;that he is  good knight, and of honourable lineage. The Temple sendeth not forth her  champions against nameless men.&rdquo;          &ldquo;My name,&rdquo; said the Knight, raising his helmet, &ldquo;is better  known, my lineage more pure, Malvoisin, than thine own. I am Wilfred of  Ivanhoe.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I will not fight with thee at present,&rdquo; said the Templar, in a  changed and hollow voice. &ldquo;Get thy wounds healed, purvey thee a better  horse, and it may be I will hold it worth my while to scourge out of thee this  boyish spirit of bravado.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Ha! proud Templar,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe, &ldquo;hast thou forgotten that  twice didst thou fall before this lance? Remember the lists at  Acre&mdash;remember the Passage of Arms at Ashby&mdash;remember thy proud vaunt  in the halls of Rotherwood, and the gage of your gold chain against my  reliquary, that thou wouldst do battle with Wilfred of Ivanhoe, and recover the  honour thou hadst lost! By that reliquary and the holy relic it contains, I  will proclaim thee, Templar, a coward in every court in Europe&mdash;in every  Preceptory of thine Order&mdash;unless thou do battle without farther  delay.&rdquo;          Bois-Guilbert turned his countenance irresolutely towards Rebecca, and then  exclaimed, looking fiercely at Ivanhoe, &ldquo;Dog of a Saxon! take thy lance,  and prepare for the death thou hast drawn upon thee!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Does the Grand Master allow me the combat?&rdquo; said Ivanhoe.          &ldquo;I may not deny what thou hast challenged,&rdquo; said the Grand Master,  &ldquo;provided the maiden accepts thee as her champion. Yet I would thou wert  in better plight to do battle. An enemy of our Order hast thou ever been, yet  would I have thee honourably met with.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thus&mdash;thus as I am, and not otherwise,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe;  &ldquo;it is the judgment of God&mdash;to his keeping I commend  myself.&mdash;Rebecca,&rdquo; said he, riding up to the fatal chair,  &ldquo;dost thou accept of me for thy champion?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; fluttered by an emotion  which the fear of death had been unable to produce, &ldquo;I do accept thee as  the champion whom Heaven hath sent me. Yet, no&mdash;no&mdash;thy wounds are  uncured&mdash;Meet not that proud man&mdash;why shouldst thou perish  also?&rdquo;          But Ivanhoe was already at his post, and had closed his visor, and assumed his  lance. Bois-Guilbert did the same; and his esquire remarked, as he clasped his  visor, that his face, which had, notwithstanding the variety of emotions by  which he had been agitated, continued during the whole morning of an ashy  paleness, was now become suddenly very much flushed.          The herald, then, seeing each champion in his place, uplifted his voice,  repeating thrice&mdash;&ldquo;Faites vos devoirs, preux chevaliers!&rdquo;  After the third cry, he withdrew to one side of the lists, and again  proclaimed, that none, on peril of instant death, should dare, by word, cry, or  action, to interfere with or disturb this fair field of combat. The Grand  Master, who held in his hand the gage of battle, Rebecca&rsquo;s glove, now  threw it into the lists, and pronounced the fatal signal words, &ldquo;Laissez  aller&rdquo;.          The trumpets sounded, and the knights charged each other in full career. The  wearied horse of Ivanhoe, and its no less exhausted rider, went down, as all  had expected, before the well-aimed lance and vigorous steed of the Templar.  This issue of the combat all had foreseen; but although the spear of Ivanhoe  did but, in comparison, touch the shield of Bois-Guilbert, that champion, to  the astonishment of all who beheld it reeled in his saddle, lost his stirrups,  and fell in the lists.          Ivanhoe, extricating himself from his fallen horse, was soon on foot, hastening  to mend his fortune with his sword; but his antagonist arose not. Wilfred,  placing his foot on his breast, and the sword&rsquo;s point to his throat,  commanded him to yield him, or die on the spot. Bois-Guilbert returned no  answer.          &ldquo;Slay him not, Sir Knight,&rdquo; cried the Grand Master,  &ldquo;unshriven and unabsolved&mdash;kill not body and soul! We allow him  vanquished.&rdquo;          He descended into the lists, and commanded them to unhelm the conquered  champion. His eyes were closed&mdash;the dark red flush was still on his brow.  As they looked on him in astonishment, the eyes opened&mdash;but they were  fixed and glazed. The flush passed from his brow, and gave way to the pallid  hue of death. Unscathed by the lance of his enemy, he had died a victim to the  violence of his own contending passions.          &ldquo;This is indeed the judgment of God,&rdquo; said the Grand Master,  looking upwards&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;Fiat voluntas tua!&rsquo;&rdquo;                     CHAPTER XLIV        So! now &rsquo;tis ended, like an old wife&rsquo;s story.          W EBSTER           When the first moments of surprise were over, Wilfred of Ivanhoe demanded of  the Grand Master, as judge of the field, if he had manfully and rightfully done  his duty in the combat? &ldquo;Manfully and rightfully hath it been  done,&rdquo; said the Grand Master. &ldquo;I pronounce the maiden free and  guiltless&mdash;The arms and the body of the deceased knight are at the will of  the victor.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I will not despoil him of his weapons,&rdquo; said the Knight of  Ivanhoe, &ldquo;nor condemn his corpse to shame&mdash;he hath fought for  Christendom&mdash;God&rsquo;s arm, no human hand, hath this day struck him  down. But let his obsequies be private, as becomes those of a man who died in  an unjust quarrel.&mdash;And for the maiden&mdash;&rdquo;          He was interrupted by a clattering of horses&rsquo; feet, advancing in such  numbers, and so rapidly, as to shake the ground before them; and the Black  Knight galloped into the lists. He was followed by a numerous band of  men-at-arms, and several knights in complete armour.          &ldquo;I am too late,&rdquo; he said, looking around him. &ldquo;I had doomed  Bois-Guilbert for mine own property.&mdash;Ivanhoe, was this well, to take on  thee such a venture, and thou scarce able to keep thy saddle?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Heaven, my Liege,&rdquo; answered Ivanhoe, &ldquo;hath taken this proud  man for its victim. He was not to be honoured in dying as your will had  designed.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Peace be with him,&rdquo; said Richard, looking steadfastly on the  corpse, &ldquo;if it may be so&mdash;he was a gallant knight, and has died in  his steel harness full knightly. But we must waste no time&mdash;Bohun, do  thine office!&rdquo;          A Knight stepped forward from the King&rsquo;s attendants, and, laying his hand  on the shoulder of Albert de Malvoisin, said, &ldquo;I arrest thee of High  Treason.&rdquo;          The Grand Master had hitherto stood astonished at the appearance of so many  warriors.&mdash;He now spoke.          &ldquo;Who dares to arrest a Knight of the Temple of Zion, within the girth of  his own Preceptory, and in the presence of the Grand Master? and by whose  authority is this bold outrage offered?&rdquo;          &ldquo;I make the arrest,&rdquo; replied the Knight&mdash;&ldquo;I, Henry  Bohun, Earl of Essex, Lord High Constable of England.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And he arrests Malvoisin,&rdquo; said the King, raising his visor,  &ldquo;by the order of Richard Plantagenet, here present.&mdash;Conrade  Mont-Fitchet, it is well for thee thou art born no subject of mine.&mdash;But  for thee, Malvoisin, thou diest with thy brother Philip, ere the world be a  week older.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I will resist thy doom,&rdquo; said the Grand Master.          &ldquo;Proud Templar,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;thou canst not&mdash;look  up, and behold the Royal Standard of England floats over thy towers instead of  thy Temple banner!&mdash;Be wise, Beaumanoir, and make no bootless  opposition&mdash;Thy hand is in the lion&rsquo;s mouth.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I will appeal to Rome against thee,&rdquo; said the Grand Master,  &ldquo;for usurpation on the immunities and privileges of our Order.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; said the King; &ldquo;but for thine own sake tax me not  with usurpation now. Dissolve thy Chapter, and depart with thy followers to thy  next Preceptory, (if thou canst find one), which has not been made the scene of  treasonable conspiracy against the King of England&mdash;Or, if thou wilt,  remain, to share our hospitality, and behold our justice.&rdquo;          &ldquo;To be a guest in the house where I should command?&rdquo; said the  Templar; &ldquo;never!&mdash;Chaplains, raise the Psalm, &lsquo;Quare  fremuerunt Gentes?&rsquo;&mdash;Knights, squires, and followers of the Holy  Temple, prepare to follow the banner of &lsquo;Beau-seant!&rsquo;&rdquo;          The Grand Master spoke with a dignity which confronted even that of  England&rsquo;s king himself, and inspired courage into his surprised and  dismayed followers. They gathered around him like the sheep around the  watch-dog, when they hear the baying of the wolf. But they evinced not the  timidity of the scared flock&mdash;there were dark brows of defiance, and looks  which menaced the hostility they dared not to proffer in words. They drew  together in a dark line of spears, from which the white cloaks of the knights  were visible among the dusky garments of their retainers, like the  lighter-coloured edges of a sable cloud. The multitude, who had raised a  clamorous shout of reprobation, paused and gazed in silence on the formidable  and experienced body to which they had unwarily bade defiance, and shrunk back  from their front.          The Earl of Essex, when he beheld them pause in their assembled force, dashed  the rowels into his charger&rsquo;s sides, and galloped backwards and forwards  to array his followers, in opposition to a band so formidable. Richard alone,  as if he loved the danger his presence had provoked, rode slowly along the  front of the Templars, calling aloud, &ldquo;What, sirs! Among so many gallant  knights, will none dare splinter a spear with Richard?&mdash;Sirs of the  Temple! your ladies are but sun-burned, if they are not worth the shiver of a  broken lance?&rdquo;          &ldquo;The Brethren of the Temple,&rdquo; said the Grand Master, riding forward  in advance of their body, &ldquo;fight not on such idle and profane  quarrel&mdash;and not with thee, Richard of England, shall a Templar cross  lance in my presence. The Pope and Princes of Europe shall judge our quarrel,  and whether a Christian prince has done well in bucklering the cause which thou  hast to-day adopted. If unassailed, we depart assailing no one. To thine honour  we refer the armour and household goods of the Order which we leave behind us,  and on thy conscience we lay the scandal and offence thou hast this day given  to Christendom.&rdquo;          With these words, and without waiting a reply, the Grand Master gave the signal  of departure. Their trumpets sounded a wild march, of an Oriental character,  which formed the usual signal for the Templars to advance. They changed their  array from a line to a column of march, and moved off as slowly as their horses  could step, as if to show it was only the will of their Grand Master, and no  fear of the opposing and superior force, which compelled them to withdraw.          &ldquo;By the splendour of Our Lady&rsquo;s brow!&rdquo; said King Richard,  &ldquo;it is pity of their lives that these Templars are not so trusty as they  are disciplined and valiant.&rdquo;          The multitude, like a timid cur which waits to bark till the object of its  challenge has turned his back, raised a feeble shout as the rear of the  squadron left the ground.          During the tumult which attended the retreat of the Templars, Rebecca saw and  heard nothing&mdash;she was locked in the arms of her aged father, giddy, and  almost senseless, with the rapid change of circumstances around her. But one  word from Isaac at length recalled her scattered feelings.          &ldquo;Let us go,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my dear daughter, my recovered  treasure&mdash;let us go to throw ourselves at the feet of the good  youth.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;O no&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;I must  not at this moment dare to speak to him&mdash;Alas! I should say more  than&mdash;No, my father, let us instantly leave this evil place.&rdquo;          &ldquo;But, my daughter,&rdquo; said Isaac, &ldquo;to leave him who hath come  forth like a strong man with his spear and shield, holding his life as nothing,  so he might redeem thy captivity; and thou, too, the daughter of a people  strange unto him and his&mdash;this is service to be thankfully  acknowledged.&rdquo;          &ldquo;It is&mdash;it is&mdash;most thankfully&mdash;most devoutly  acknowledged,&rdquo; said Rebecca&mdash;&ldquo;it shall be still more  so&mdash;but not now&mdash;for the sake of thy beloved Rachel, father, grant my  request&mdash;not now!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nay, but,&rdquo; said Isaac, insisting, &ldquo;they will deem us more  thankless than mere dogs!&rdquo;          &ldquo;But thou seest, my dear father, that King Richard is in presence, and  that&mdash;-&rdquo;          &ldquo;True, my best&mdash;my wisest Rebecca!&mdash;Let us hence&mdash;let us  hence!&mdash;Money he will lack, for he has just returned from Palestine, and,  as they say, from prison&mdash;and pretext for exacting it, should he need any,  may arise out of my simple traffic with his brother John. Away, away, let us  hence!&rdquo;          And hurrying his daughter in his turn, he conducted her from the lists, and by  means of conveyance which he had provided, transported her safely to the house  of the Rabbi Nathan.          The Jewess, whose fortunes had formed the principal interest of the day, having  now retired unobserved, the attention of the populace was transferred to the  Black Knight. They now filled the air with &ldquo;Long life to Richard with the  Lion&rsquo;s Heart, and down with the usurping Templars!&rdquo;          &ldquo;Notwithstanding all this lip-loyalty,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe to the Earl of  Essex, &ldquo;it was well the King took the precaution to bring thee with him,  noble Earl, and so many of thy trusty followers.&rdquo;          The Earl smiled and shook his head.          &ldquo;Gallant Ivanhoe,&rdquo; said Essex, &ldquo;dost thou know our Master so  well, and yet suspect him of taking so wise a precaution! I was drawing towards  York having heard that Prince John was making head there, when I met King  Richard, like a true knight-errant, galloping hither to achieve in his own  person this adventure of the Templar and the Jewess, with his own single arm. I  accompanied him with my band, almost maugre his consent.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And what news from York, brave Earl?&rdquo; said Ivanhoe; &ldquo;will  the rebels bide us there?&rdquo;          &ldquo;No more than December&rsquo;s snow will bide July&rsquo;s sun,&rdquo;  said the Earl; &ldquo;they are dispersing; and who should come posting to bring  us the news, but John himself!&rdquo;          &ldquo;The traitor! the ungrateful insolent traitor!&rdquo; said Ivanhoe;  &ldquo;did not Richard order him into confinement?&rdquo;          &ldquo;O! he received him,&rdquo; answered the Earl, &ldquo;as if they had met  after a hunting party; and, pointing to me and our men-at-arms, said,  &lsquo;Thou seest, brother, I have some angry men with me&mdash;thou wert best  go to our mother, carry her my duteous affection, and abide with her until  men&rsquo;s minds are pacified.&rsquo;&rdquo;          &ldquo;And this was all he said?&rdquo; enquired Ivanhoe; &ldquo;would not any  one say that this Prince invites men to treason by his clemency?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Just,&rdquo; replied the Earl, &ldquo;as the man may be said to invite  death, who undertakes to fight a combat, having a dangerous wound  unhealed.&rdquo;          &ldquo;I forgive thee the jest, Lord Earl,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe; &ldquo;but,  remember, I hazarded but my own life&mdash;Richard, the welfare of his  kingdom.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Those,&rdquo; replied Essex, &ldquo;who are specially careless of their  own welfare, are seldom remarkably attentive to that of others&mdash;But let us  haste to the castle, for Richard meditates punishing some of the subordinate  members of the conspiracy, though he has pardoned their principal.&rdquo;          From the judicial investigations which followed on this occasion, and which are  given at length in the Wardour Manuscript, it appears that Maurice de Bracy  escaped beyond seas, and went into the service of Philip of France; while  Philip de Malvoisin, and his brother Albert, the Preceptor of Templestowe, were  executed, although Waldemar Fitzurse, the soul of the conspiracy, escaped with  banishment; and Prince John, for whose behoof it was undertaken, was not even  censured by his good-natured brother. No one, however, pitied the fate of the  two Malvoisins, who only suffered the death which they had both well deserved,  by many acts of falsehood, cruelty, and oppression.          Briefly after the judicial combat, Cedric the Saxon was summoned to the court  of Richard, which, for the purpose of quieting the counties that had been  disturbed by the ambition of his brother, was then held at York. Cedric tushed  and pshawed more than once at the message&mdash;but he refused not obedience.  In fact, the return of Richard had quenched every hope that he had entertained  of restoring a Saxon dynasty in England; for, whatever head the Saxons might  have made in the event of a civil war, it was plain that nothing could be done  under the undisputed dominion of Richard, popular as he was by his personal  good qualities and military fame, although his administration was wilfully  careless, now too indulgent, and now allied to despotism.          But, moreover, it could not escape even Cedric&rsquo;s reluctant observation,  that his project for an absolute union among the Saxons, by the marriage of  Rowena and Athelstane, was now completely at an end, by the mutual dissent of  both parties concerned. This was, indeed, an event which, in his ardour for the  Saxon cause, he could not have anticipated, and even when the disinclination of  both was broadly and plainly manifested, he could scarce bring himself to  believe that two Saxons of royal descent should scruple, on personal grounds,  at an alliance so necessary for the public weal of the nation. But it was not  the less certain: Rowena had always expressed her repugnance to Athelstane, and  now Athelstane was no less plain and positive in proclaiming his resolution  never to pursue his addresses to the Lady Rowena. Even the natural obstinacy of  Cedric sunk beneath these obstacles, where he, remaining on the point of  junction, had the task of dragging a reluctant pair up to it, one with each  hand. He made, however, a last vigorous attack on Athelstane, and he found that  resuscitated sprout of Saxon royalty engaged, like country squires of our own  day, in a furious war with the clergy.          It seems that, after all his deadly menaces against the Abbot of Saint  Edmund&rsquo;s, Athelstane&rsquo;s spirit of revenge, what between the natural  indolent kindness of his own disposition, what through the prayers of his  mother Edith, attached, like most ladies, (of the period,) to the clerical  order, had terminated in his keeping the Abbot and his monks in the dungeons of  Coningsburgh for three days on a meagre diet. For this atrocity the Abbot  menaced him with excommunication, and made out a dreadful list of complaints in  the bowels and stomach, suffered by himself and his monks, in consequence of  the tyrannical and unjust imprisonment they had sustained. With this  controversy, and with the means he had adopted to counteract this clerical  persecution, Cedric found the mind of his friend Athelstane so fully occupied,  that it had no room for another idea. And when Rowena&rsquo;s name was  mentioned the noble Athelstane prayed leave to quaff a full goblet to her  health, and that she might soon be the bride of his kinsman Wilfred. It was a  desperate case therefore. There was obviously no more to be made of Athelstane;  or, as Wamba expressed it, in a phrase which has descended from Saxon times to  ours, he was a cock that would not fight.          There remained betwixt Cedric and the determination which the lovers desired to  come to, only two obstacles&mdash;his own obstinacy, and his dislike of the  Norman dynasty. The former feeling gradually gave way before the endearments of  his ward, and the pride which he could not help nourishing in the fame of his  son. Besides, he was not insensible to the honour of allying his own line to  that of Alfred, when the superior claims of the descendant of Edward the  Confessor were abandoned for ever. Cedric&rsquo;s aversion to the Norman race  of kings was also much undermined,&mdash;first, by consideration of the  impossibility of ridding England of the new dynasty, a feeling which goes far  to create loyalty in the subject to the king &ldquo;de facto&rdquo;; and,  secondly, by the personal attention of King Richard, who delighted in the blunt  humour of Cedric, and, to use the language of the Wardour Manuscript, so dealt  with the noble Saxon, that, ere he had been a guest at court for seven days, he  had given his consent to the marriage of his ward Rowena and his son Wilfred of  Ivanhoe.          The nuptials of our hero, thus formally approved by his father, were celebrated  in the most august of temples, the noble Minster of York. The King himself  attended, and from the countenance which he afforded on this and other  occasions to the distressed and hitherto degraded Saxons, gave them a safer and  more certain prospect of attaining their just rights, than they could  reasonably hope from the precarious chance of a civil war. The Church gave her  full solemnities, graced with all the splendour which she of Rome knows how to  apply with such brilliant effect.          Gurth, gallantly apparelled, attended as esquire upon his young master whom he  had served so faithfully, and the magnanimous Wamba, decorated with a new cap  and a most gorgeous set of silver bells. Sharers of Wilfred&rsquo;s dangers and  adversity, they remained, as they had a right to expect, the partakers of his  more prosperous career.          But besides this domestic retinue, these distinguished nuptials were celebrated  by the attendance of the high-born Normans, as well as Saxons, joined with the  universal jubilee of the lower orders, that marked the marriage of two  individuals as a pledge of the future peace and harmony betwixt two races,  which, since that period, have been so completely mingled, that the distinction  has become wholly invisible. Cedric lived to see this union approximate towards  its completion; for as the two nations mixed in society and formed  intermarriages with each other, the Normans abated their scorn, and the Saxons  were refined from their rusticity. But it was not until the reign of Edward the  Third that the mixed language, now termed English, was spoken at the court of  London, and that the hostile distinction of Norman and Saxon seems entirely to  have disappeared.          It was upon the second morning after this happy bridal, that the Lady Rowena  was made acquainted by her handmaid Elgitha, that a damsel desired admission to  her presence, and solicited that their parley might be without witness. Rowena  wondered, hesitated, became curious, and ended by commanding the damsel to be  admitted, and her attendants to withdraw.          She entered&mdash;a noble and commanding figure, the long white veil, in which  she was shrouded, overshadowing rather than concealing the elegance and majesty  of her shape. Her demeanour was that of respect, unmingled by the least shade  either of fear, or of a wish to propitiate favour. Rowena was ever ready to  acknowledge the claims, and attend to the feelings, of others. She arose, and  would have conducted her lovely visitor to a seat; but the stranger looked at  Elgitha, and again intimated a wish to discourse with the Lady Rowena alone.  Elgitha had no sooner retired with unwilling steps, than, to the surprise of  the Lady of Ivanhoe, her fair visitant kneeled on one knee, pressed her hands  to her forehead, and bending her head to the ground, in spite of Rowena&rsquo;s  resistance, kissed the embroidered hem of her tunic.                      &ldquo;What means this, lady?&rdquo; said the surprised bride; &ldquo;or why do  you offer to me a deference so unusual?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Because to you, Lady of Ivanhoe,&rdquo; said Rebecca, rising up and  resuming the usual quiet dignity of her manner, &ldquo;I may lawfully, and  without rebuke, pay the debt of gratitude which I owe to Wilfred of Ivanhoe. I  am&mdash;forgive the boldness which has offered to you the homage of my  country&mdash;I am the unhappy Jewess, for whom your husband hazarded his life  against such fearful odds in the tiltyard of Templestowe.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Damsel,&rdquo; said Rowena, &ldquo;Wilfred of Ivanhoe on that day  rendered back but in slight measure your unceasing charity towards him in his  wounds and misfortunes. Speak, is there aught remains in which he or I can  serve thee?&rdquo;          &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Rebecca, calmly, &ldquo;unless you will transmit to  him my grateful farewell.&rdquo;          &ldquo;You leave England then?&rdquo; said Rowena, scarce recovering the  surprise of this extraordinary visit.          &ldquo;I leave it, lady, ere this moon again changes. My father had a brother  high in favour with Mohammed Boabdil, King of Grenada&mdash;thither we go,  secure of peace and protection, for the payment of such ransom as the Moslem  exact from our people.&rdquo;          &ldquo;And are you not then as well protected in England?&rdquo; said Rowena.  &ldquo;My husband has favour with the King&mdash;the King himself is just and  generous.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;I doubt it not&mdash;but the people of  England are a fierce race, quarrelling ever with their neighbours or among  themselves, and ready to plunge the sword into the bowels of each other. Such  is no safe abode for the children of my people. Ephraim is an heartless  dove&mdash;Issachar an over-laboured drudge, which stoops between two burdens.  Not in a land of war and blood, surrounded by hostile neighbours, and  distracted by internal factions, can Israel hope to rest during her  wanderings.&rdquo;          &ldquo;But you, maiden,&rdquo; said Rowena&mdash;&ldquo;you surely can have  nothing to fear. She who nursed the sick-bed of Ivanhoe,&rdquo; she continued,  rising with enthusiasm&mdash;&ldquo;she can have nothing to fear in England,  where Saxon and Norman will contend who shall most do her honour.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Thy speech is fair, lady,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;and thy purpose  fairer; but it may not be&mdash;there is a gulf betwixt us. Our breeding, our  faith, alike forbid either to pass over it. Farewell&mdash;yet, ere I go  indulge me one request. The bridal-veil hangs over thy face; deign to raise it,  and let me see the features of which fame speaks so highly.&rdquo;          &ldquo;They are scarce worthy of being looked upon,&rdquo; said Rowena;  &ldquo;but, expecting the same from my visitant, I remove the veil.&rdquo;          She took it off accordingly; and, partly from the consciousness of beauty,  partly from bashfulness, she blushed so intensely, that cheek, brow, neck, and  bosom, were suffused with crimson. Rebecca blushed also, but it was a momentary  feeling; and, mastered by higher emotions, past slowly from her features like  the crimson cloud, which changes colour when the sun sinks beneath the horizon.          &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the countenance you have deigned to show  me will long dwell in my remembrance. There reigns in it gentleness and  goodness; and if a tinge of the world&rsquo;s pride or vanities may mix with an  expression so lovely, how should we chide that which is of earth for bearing  some colour of its original? Long, long will I remember your features, and  bless God that I leave my noble deliverer united with&mdash;&rdquo;          She stopped short&mdash;her eyes filled with tears. She hastily wiped them, and  answered to the anxious enquiries of Rowena&mdash;&ldquo;I am well,  lady&mdash;well. But my heart swells when I think of Torquilstone and the lists  of Templestowe.&mdash;Farewell. One, the most trifling part of my duty, remains  undischarged. Accept this casket&mdash;startle not at its contents.&rdquo;          Rowena opened the small silver-chased casket, and perceived a carcanet, or neck  lace, with ear-jewels, of diamonds, which were obviously of immense value.          &ldquo;It is impossible,&rdquo; she said, tendering back the casket. &ldquo;I  dare not accept a gift of such consequence.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Yet keep it, lady,&rdquo; returned Rebecca.&mdash;&ldquo;You have power,  rank, command, influence; we have wealth, the source both of our strength and  weakness; the value of these toys, ten times multiplied, would not influence  half so much as your slightest wish. To you, therefore, the gift is of little  value,&mdash;and to me, what I part with is of much less. Let me not think you  deem so wretchedly ill of my nation as your commons believe. Think ye that I  prize these sparkling fragments of stone above my liberty? or that my father  values them in comparison to the honour of his only child? Accept them,  lady&mdash;to me they are valueless. I will never wear jewels more.&rdquo;          &ldquo;You are then unhappy!&rdquo; said Rowena, struck with the manner in  which Rebecca uttered the last words. &ldquo;O, remain with us&mdash;the  counsel of holy men will wean you from your erring law, and I will be a sister  to you.&rdquo;          &ldquo;No, lady,&rdquo; answered Rebecca, the same calm melancholy reigning in  her soft voice and beautiful features&mdash;&ldquo;that&mdash;may not be. I may  not change the faith of my fathers like a garment unsuited to the climate in  which I seek to dwell, and unhappy, lady, I will not be. He, to whom I dedicate  my future life, will be my comforter, if I do His will.&rdquo;          &ldquo;Have you then convents, to one of which you mean to retire?&rdquo; asked  Rowena.          &ldquo;No, lady,&rdquo; said the Jewess; &ldquo;but among our people, since the  time of Abraham downwards, have been women who have devoted their thoughts to  Heaven, and their actions to works of kindness to men, tending the sick,  feeding the hungry, and relieving the distressed. Among these will Rebecca be  numbered. Say this to thy lord, should he chance to enquire after the fate of  her whose life he saved.&rdquo;          There was an involuntary tremour on Rebecca&rsquo;s voice, and a tenderness of  accent, which perhaps betrayed more than she would willingly have expressed.  She hastened to bid Rowena adieu.          &ldquo;Farewell,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;May He, who made both Jew and  Christian, shower down on you his choicest blessings! The bark that waits us  hence will be under weigh ere we can reach the port.&rdquo;          She glided from the apartment, leaving Rowena surprised as if a vision had  passed before her. The fair Saxon related the singular conference to her  husband, on whose mind it made a deep impression. He lived long and happily  with Rowena, for they were attached to each other by the bonds of early  affection, and they loved each other the more, from the recollection of the  obstacles which had impeded their union. Yet it would be enquiring too  curiously to ask, whether the recollection of Rebecca&rsquo;s beauty and  magnanimity did not recur to his mind more frequently than the fair descendant  of Alfred might altogether have approved.          Ivanhoe distinguished himself in the service of Richard, and was graced with  farther marks of the royal favour. He might have risen still higher, but for  the premature death of the heroic Cœur-de-Lion, before the Castle of Chaluz,  near Limoges.
