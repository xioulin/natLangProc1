TSAR CHATBOT:



Classify dialogue:
-who is talking to whom
-define class of major characters: i.e. get mentioned frequently
- define class of dialogue, assign which characters participate when
- character list
- defining features: gender, age range?, likes paris?,


named entity

Dialogue 1: Jake, Cohn, Frances (end ch1)
Dialogue 2: Jake, Cohn (entire ch2)

(ch3)
Dialogue3: Jake, girl who turns out to be Georgette, others

This is a pain, trying to manually identify speakers. better to write a
program to do the classification, then randomly sample classifications and
verify if correct. Could randomly sample like 20-30 or so, run stats on it
on go from there.

this would be part of hte machine learning thing, get the program to classify
dialogue speakers and then check for accuracy.
