Deepish dive on Presidential Inaugural Addresses


Add some visualizations, like speech bubbles or whatever.







Inaug Address Cosine Similarity:

HOw similar is each address to each other compared to a non inaugural presidential speech or
perhaps some unrelated speech?

Can you determine, based on the speech, whether the given speaker is the president of the united states
or not?

I just need to do something that will get me hired. Something fun, with the dead presidents. Something interactive
so I don't have to have a technical audience, I can just demonstrate this with regular/everyday people.
