TF-IDF in inaugural addresses for "freedom" or for duty or such ideas

what does tf-idf even tell you


tf: term frequency: number of times term t shows up in document d

    num_times t shows up / num_times for all words


idf: log (tot_num of documents / num of documents containing term t)

so what's the td-idf for
f
1. slavery
2. economy

Inaug Address Cosine Similarity:

HOw similar is each address to each other compared to a non inaugural presidential speech or
perhaps some unrelated speech?

Can you determine, based on the speech, whether the given speaker is the president of the united states
or not?

I just need to do something that will get me hired. Something fun, with the dead presidents. Something interactive
so I don't have to have a technical audience, I can just demonstrate this with regular/everyday people.
