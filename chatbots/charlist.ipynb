Besides this\\r\\nnothing that he so plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave me his\\r\\ncountenance seems to take from me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the\\r\\nplace of a brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my\\r\\neducation.

I’ll tell\\r\\nthee, Charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full of ambition,\\r\\nan envious emulator of every man’s good parts, a secret and villainous\\r\\ncontriver against me his natural brother. Therefore use thy discretion. I had\\r\\nas lief thou didst break his neck as his finger. And thou wert best look to’t;\\r\\nfor if thou dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace\\r\\nhimself on thee, he will practise against thee by poison, entrap thee by some\\r\\ntreacherous device, and never leave thee till he hath ta’en thy life by some\\r\\nindirect means or other. For I assure thee (and almost with tears I speak it)\\r\\nthere is not one so young and so villainous this day living.

In respect that it is solitary, I like\\r\\nit very well; but in respect that it is private, it is a very vile life. Now in\\r\\nrespect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect it is not in\\r\\nthe court, it is tedious. As it is a spare life, look you, it fits my humour\\r\\nwell; but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much against my stomach.\\r\\nHast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p class=\"drama\">\\r\\nCORIN.<br>\\r\\nNo more but that I know the more one sickens, the worse at ease he is; and that\\r\\nhe that wants money, means, and content is without three good friends; that\\r\\nthe property of rain is to wet, and fire to burn; that good pasture makes fat\\r\\nsheep; and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that\\r\\nhath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding or comes\\r\\nof a very dull kindred.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p class=\"drama\">\\r\\nTOUCHSTONE.<br>\\r\\nSuch a one is a natural philosopher.

Thou art in a parlous state, shepherd.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p class=\"drama\">\\r\\nCORIN.<br>\\r\\nNot a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good manners at the court are as\\r\\nridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the country is most mockable at\\r\\nthe court.

There is a man\\r\\nhaunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving “Rosalind” on their\\r\\nbarks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles; all, forsooth,\\r\\ndeifying the name of Rosalind.

Then your hose should be ungartered, your bonnet unbanded,\\r\\nyour sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe untied, and everything about you\\r\\ndemonstrating a careless desolation. But you are no such man.

He was to imagine me his love, his mistress, and\\r\\nI set him every day to woo me; at which time would I, being but a moonish\\r\\nyouth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing and liking, proud,\\r\\nfantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; for\\r\\nevery passion something and for no passion truly anything, as boys and women\\r\\nare for the most part cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe\\r\\nhim; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep for him, then spit at him;\\r\\nthat I drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of\\r\\nmadness, which was to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a\\r\\nnook merely monastic.

An Orchard near Oliver’s house  \\r\\n \\r\\nEnter  Orlando  and\\r\\n Adam .\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nAs I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a\\r\\nthousand crowns, and, as thou sayst, charged my brother, on his blessing, to\\r\\nbreed me well; and there begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at\\r\\nschool, and report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me\\r\\nrustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at home unkept;\\r\\nfor call you that keeping, for a gentleman of my birth, that differs not from\\r\\nthe stalling of an ox? His horses are bred better, for, besides that they are\\r\\nfair with their feeding, they are taught their manage and to that end riders\\r\\ndearly hired; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth, for the\\r\\nwhich his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I. Besides this\\r\\nnothing that he so plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave me his\\r\\ncountenance seems to take from me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the\\r\\nplace of a brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my\\r\\neducation. This is it, Adam, that grieves me, and the spirit of my father,\\r\\nwhich I think is within me, begins to mutiny against this servitude. I will no\\r\\nlonger endure it, though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid it.\\r\\n \\r\\n Enter  Oliver . \\r\\n \\r\\nADAM. \\r\\nYonder comes my master, your brother.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nGo apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up.\\r\\n \\r\\n [  Adam  retires. ] \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nNow, sir, what make you here?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nNothing. I am not taught to make anything.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nWhat mar you then, sir?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nMarry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God made, a poor unworthy\\r\\nbrother of yours, with idleness.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nMarry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nShall I keep your hogs, and eat husks with them? What prodigal portion have I\\r\\nspent that I should come to such penury?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nKnow you where you are, sir?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nO, sir, very well: here in your orchard.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nKnow you before whom, sir?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nAy, better than him I am before knows me. I know you are my eldest brother, and\\r\\nin the gentle condition of blood you should so know me. The courtesy of\\r\\nnations allows you my better in that you are the first-born, but the same\\r\\ntradition takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt us. I\\r\\nhave as much of my father in me as you, albeit I confess your coming before\\r\\nme is nearer to his reverence.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nWhat, boy!\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nCome, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nWilt thou lay hands on me, villain?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nI am no villain. I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys; he was my\\r\\nfather, and he is thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains. Wert\\r\\nthou not my brother, I would not take this hand from thy throat till this other\\r\\nhad pulled out thy tongue for saying so. Thou has railed on thyself.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nADAM. \\r\\n[ Coming forward .] Sweet masters, be patient. For your father’s\\r\\nremembrance, be at accord.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nLet me go, I say.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nI will not till I please. You shall hear me. My father charged you in his will\\r\\nto give me good education. You have trained me like a peasant, obscuring and\\r\\nhiding from me all gentleman-like qualities. The spirit of my father grows\\r\\nstrong in me, and I will no longer endure it. Therefore allow me such\\r\\nexercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor allottery my father\\r\\nleft me by testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nAnd what wilt thou do? Beg when that is spent? Well, sir, get you in. I will\\r\\nnot long be troubled with you. You shall have some part of your will. I pray\\r\\nyou leave me.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nI no further offend you than becomes me for my good.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nGet you with him, you old dog.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nADAM. \\r\\nIs “old dog” my reward? Most true, I have lost my teeth in your service. God be\\r\\nwith my old master. He would not have spoke such a word.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n[ Exeunt  Orlando  and\\r\\n Adam . ]\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nIs it even so? Begin you to grow upon me? I will physic your rankness, and yet\\r\\ngive no thousand crowns neither. Holla, Dennis!\\r\\n \\r\\n Enter  Dennis . \\r\\n \\r\\nDENNIS \\r\\nCalls your worship?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nWas not Charles, the Duke’s wrestler, here to speak with me?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDENNIS \\r\\nSo please you, he is here at the door and importunes access to you.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nCall him in.\\r\\n \\r\\n [ Exit  Dennis . ] \\r\\n \\r\\n’Twill be a good way, and tomorrow the wrestling is.\\r\\n \\r\\n Enter  Charles . \\r\\n \\r\\nCHARLES. \\r\\nGood morrow to your worship.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nGood Monsieur Charles. What’s the new news at the new court?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCHARLES. \\r\\nThere’s no news at the court, sir, but the old news. That is, the old Duke is\\r\\nbanished by his younger brother the new Duke, and three or four loving lords\\r\\nhave put themselves into voluntary exile with him, whose lands and revenues\\r\\nenrich the new Duke; therefore he gives them good leave to wander.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nCan you tell if Rosalind, the Duke’s daughter, be banished with her father?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCHARLES. \\r\\nO, no; for the Duke’s daughter, her cousin, so loves her, being ever from their\\r\\ncradles bred together, that she would have followed her exile or have died to\\r\\nstay behind her. She is at the court and no less beloved of her uncle than his\\r\\nown daughter, and never two ladies loved as they do.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nWhere will the old Duke live?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCHARLES. \\r\\nThey say he is already in the Forest of Arden, and a many merry men with him;\\r\\nand there they live like the old Robin Hood of England. They say many young\\r\\ngentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time carelessly, as they did in\\r\\nthe golden world.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nWhat, you wrestle tomorrow before the new Duke?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCHARLES. \\r\\nMarry, do I, sir, and I came to acquaint you with a matter. I am given, sir,\\r\\nsecretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition\\r\\nto come in disguised against me to try a fall. Tomorrow, sir, I wrestle for my\\r\\ncredit, and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well.\\r\\nYour brother is but young and tender, and for your love I would be loath to\\r\\nfoil him, as I must for my own honour if he come in. Therefore, out of my\\r\\nlove to you, I came hither to acquaint you withal, that either you might stay\\r\\nhim from his intendment, or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in\\r\\nthat it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nCharles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt find I will most\\r\\nkindly requite. I had myself notice of my brother’s purpose herein, and have by\\r\\nunderhand means laboured to dissuade him from it; but he is resolute. I’ll tell\\r\\nthee, Charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full of ambition,\\r\\nan envious emulator of every man’s good parts, a secret and villainous\\r\\ncontriver against me his natural brother. Therefore use thy discretion. I had\\r\\nas lief thou didst break his neck as his finger. And thou wert best look to’t;\\r\\nfor if thou dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace\\r\\nhimself on thee, he will practise against thee by poison, entrap thee by some\\r\\ntreacherous device, and never leave thee till he hath ta’en thy life by some\\r\\nindirect means or other. For I assure thee (and almost with tears I speak it)\\r\\nthere is not one so young and so villainous this day living. I speak but\\r\\nbrotherly of him, but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush and\\r\\nweep, and thou must look pale and wonder.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCHARLES. \\r\\nI am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come tomorrow I’ll give him his\\r\\npayment. If ever he go alone again I’ll never wrestle for prize more. And so,\\r\\nGod keep your worship.\\r\\n \\r\\n [ Exit. ] \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nFarewell, good Charles. Now will I stir this gamester. I hope I shall see an\\r\\nend of him; for my soul—yet I know not why—hates nothing more than he. Yet\\r\\nhe’s gentle, never schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of all sorts\\r\\nenchantingly beloved, and indeed so much in the heart of the world, and\\r\\nespecially of my own people, who best know him, that I am altogether misprized.\\r\\nBut it shall not be so long; this wrestler shall clear all. Nothing remains but\\r\\nthat I kindle the boy thither, which now I’ll go about.\\r\\n \\r\\n [ Exit. ] \\r\\n     SCENE II. A Lawn before the Duke’s Palace  \\r\\n \\r\\nEnter  Rosalind  and\\r\\n Celia .\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nI pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nDear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of, and would you yet I were\\r\\nmerrier? Unless you could teach me to forget a banished father, you must not\\r\\nlearn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nHerein I see thou lov’st me not with the full weight that I love thee. If my\\r\\nuncle, thy banished father, had banished thy uncle, the Duke my father, so thou\\r\\nhadst been still with me, I could have taught my love to take thy father for\\r\\nmine. So wouldst thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously\\r\\ntempered as mine is to thee.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nWell, I will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nYou know my father hath no child but I, nor none is like to have; and truly,\\r\\nwhen he dies thou shalt be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy\\r\\nfather perforce, I will render thee again in affection. By mine honour I will!\\r\\nAnd when I break that oath, let me turn monster. Therefore, my sweet Rose, my\\r\\ndear Rose, be merry.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nFrom henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let me see—what think you of\\r\\nfalling in love?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nMarry, I prithee do, to make sport withal; but love no man in good earnest,\\r\\nnor no further in sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in\\r\\nhonour come off again.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nWhat shall be our sport, then?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nLet us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her wheel, that her gifts\\r\\nmay henceforth be bestowed equally.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nI would we could do so, for her benefits are mightily misplaced, and the\\r\\nbountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\n’Tis true, for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest, and those\\r\\nthat she makes honest she makes very ill-favouredly.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nNay, now thou goest from Fortune’s office to Nature’s. Fortune reigns in gifts\\r\\nof the world, not in the lineaments of Nature.\\r\\n \\r\\n Enter  Touchstone . \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nNo? When Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by Fortune fall into the\\r\\nfire? Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune\\r\\nsent in this fool to cut off the argument?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nIndeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when Fortune makes Nature’s\\r\\nnatural the cutter-off of Nature’s wit.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nPeradventure this is not Fortune’s work neither, but Nature’s, who perceiveth\\r\\nour natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses, and hath sent this\\r\\nnatural for our whetstone; for always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone\\r\\nof the wits.—How now, wit, whither wander you?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nMistress, you must come away to your father.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nWere you made the messenger?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nNo, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nWhere learned you that oath, fool?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nOf a certain knight that swore by his honour they were good pancakes, and swore\\r\\nby his honour the mustard was naught. Now, I’ll stand to it, the pancakes were\\r\\nnaught and the mustard was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nHow prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nAy, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nStand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and swear by your beards that I am\\r\\na knave.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nBy our beards, if we had them, thou art.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nBy my knavery, if I had it, then I were. But if you swear by that that is not,\\r\\nyou are not forsworn. No more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he\\r\\nnever had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those\\r\\npancackes or that mustard.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nPrithee, who is’t that thou mean’st?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nOne that old Frederick, your father, loves.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nMy father’s love is enough to honour him. Enough! Speak no more of him. You’ll\\r\\nbe whipped for taxation one of these days.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nThe more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nBy my troth, thou sayest true. For since the little wit that fools have was\\r\\nsilenced, the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes\\r\\nMonsieur Le Beau.\\r\\n \\r\\n Enter  Le Beau . \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nWith his mouth full of news.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nWhich he will put on us as pigeons feed their young.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nThen shall we be news-crammed.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nAll the better; we shall be the more marketable. \\r\\n Bonjour , Monsieur Le Beau. What’s the news?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nLE BEAU. \\r\\nFair princess, you have lost much good sport.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nSport! Of what colour?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nLE BEAU. \\r\\nWhat colour, madam? How shall I answer you?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nAs wit and fortune will.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nOr as the destinies decrees.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nWell said. That was laid on with a trowel.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nNay, if I keep not my rank—\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nThou losest thy old smell.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nLE BEAU. \\r\\nYou amaze me, ladies. I would have told you of good wrestling, which you have\\r\\nlost the sight of.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nYet tell us the manner of the wrestling.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nLE BEAU. \\r\\nI will tell you the beginning and, if it please your ladyships, you may see\\r\\nthe end, for the best is yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming to\\r\\nperform it.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nWell, the beginning that is dead and buried.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nLE BEAU. \\r\\nThere comes an old man and his three sons—\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nI could match this beginning with an old tale.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nLE BEAU. \\r\\nThree proper young men of excellent growth and presence.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nWith bills on their necks: “Be it known unto all men by these presents.”\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nLE BEAU. \\r\\nThe eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the Duke’s wrestler, which\\r\\nCharles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs, that there is\\r\\nlittle hope of life in him. So he served the second, and so the third. Yonder\\r\\nthey lie, the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them\\r\\nthat all the beholders take his part with weeping.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nAlas!\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nBut what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have lost?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nLE BEAU. \\r\\nWhy, this that I speak of.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nThus men may grow wiser every day. It is the first time that ever I heard\\r\\nbreaking of ribs was sport for ladies.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nOr I, I promise thee.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nBut is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides? Is there yet\\r\\nanother dotes upon rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nLE BEAU. \\r\\nYou must if you stay here, for here is the place appointed for the wrestling,\\r\\nand they are ready to perform it.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nYonder, sure, they are coming. Let us now stay and see it.\\r\\n \\r\\n Flourish. Enter  Duke Frederick,\\r\\nLords, Orlando, Charles  and Attendants. \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK. \\r\\nCome on. Since the youth will not be entreated, his own peril on his\\r\\nforwardness.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nIs yonder the man?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nLE BEAU. \\r\\nEven he, madam.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nAlas, he is too young. Yet he looks successfully.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK. \\r\\nHow now, daughter and cousin? Are you crept hither to see the wrestling?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nAy, my liege, so please you give us leave.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK. \\r\\nYou will take little delight in it, I can tell you, there is such odds in the\\r\\nman. In pity of the challenger’s youth I would fain dissuade him, but he will\\r\\nnot be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if you can move him.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nCall him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK. \\r\\nDo so; I’ll not be by.\\r\\n \\r\\n [  Duke Frederick  steps\\r\\naside. ] \\r\\n \\r\\nLE BEAU. \\r\\nMonsieur the challenger, the Princess calls for you.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nI attend them with all respect and duty.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nYoung man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nNo, fair princess. He is the general challenger. I come but in as others do,\\r\\nto try with him the strength of my youth.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nYoung gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years. You have seen cruel\\r\\nproof of this man’s strength. If you saw yourself with your eyes or knew\\r\\nyourself with your judgement, the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a\\r\\nmore equal enterprise. We pray you for your own sake to embrace your own\\r\\nsafety and give over this attempt.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nDo, young sir. Your reputation shall not therefore be misprized. We will make\\r\\nit our suit to the Duke that the wrestling might not go forward.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nI beseech you, punish me not with your hard thoughts, wherein I confess me much\\r\\nguilty to deny so fair and excellent ladies anything. But let your fair eyes\\r\\nand gentle wishes go with me to my trial, wherein if I be foiled there is but\\r\\none shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one dead that is willing to\\r\\nbe so. I shall do my friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me; the world\\r\\nno injury, for in it I have nothing. Only in the world I fill up a place, which\\r\\nmay be better supplied when I have made it empty.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nThe little strength that I have, I would it were with you.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nAnd mine to eke out hers.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nFare you well. Pray heaven I be deceived in you.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nYour heart’s desires be with you.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCHARLES. \\r\\nCome, where is this young gallant that is so desirous to lie with his mother\\r\\nearth?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nReady, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK. \\r\\nYou shall try but one fall.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCHARLES. \\r\\nNo, I warrant your grace you shall not entreat him to a second, that have so\\r\\nmightily persuaded him from a first.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nYou mean to mock me after; you should not have mocked me before. But come your\\r\\nways.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nNow, Hercules be thy speed, young man!\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nI would I were invisible, to catch the strong fellow by the leg.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n[  Orlando  and\\r\\n Charles  wrestle. ]\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nO excellent young man!\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nIf I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who should down.\\r\\n \\r\\n [  Charles  is thrown. Shout. ] \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK. \\r\\nNo more, no more.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nYes, I beseech your grace. I am not yet well breathed.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK. \\r\\nHow dost thou, Charles?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nLE BEAU. \\r\\nHe cannot speak, my lord.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK. \\r\\nBear him away.\\r\\n \\r\\n [  Charles  is carried off by Attendants. ] \\r\\n \\r\\nWhat is thy name, young man?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nOrlando, my liege, the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK. \\r\\nI would thou hadst been son to some man else. \\r\\nThe world esteemed thy father honourable, \\r\\nBut I did find him still mine enemy. \\r\\nThou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed \\r\\nHadst thou descended from another house. \\r\\nBut fare thee well, thou art a gallant youth. \\r\\nI would thou hadst told me of another father.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n[ Exeunt  Duke Frederick, Le Beau  and\\r\\nLords. ]\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nWere I my father, coz, would I do this?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nI am more proud to be Sir Rowland’s son, \\r\\nHis youngest son, and would not change that calling \\r\\nTo be adopted heir to Frederick.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nMy father loved Sir Rowland as his soul, \\r\\nAnd all the world was of my father’s mind. \\r\\nHad I before known this young man his son, \\r\\nI should have given him tears unto entreaties \\r\\nEre he should thus have ventured.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nGentle cousin, \\r\\nLet us go thank him and encourage him. \\r\\nMy father’s rough and envious disposition \\r\\nSticks me at heart.—Sir, you have well deserved. \\r\\nIf you do keep your promises in love \\r\\nBut justly, as you have exceeded promise, \\r\\nYour mistress shall be happy.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nGentleman,\\r\\n \\r\\n [ Giving him a chain from her neck .] \\r\\n \\r\\nWear this for me—one out of suits with Fortune, \\r\\nThat could give more but that her hand lacks means.— \\r\\nShall we go, coz?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nAy.—Fare you well, fair gentleman.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nCan I not say, I thank you? My better parts \\r\\nAre all thrown down, and that which here stands up \\r\\nIs but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nHe calls us back. My pride fell with my fortunes. \\r\\nI’ll ask him what he would.—Did you call, sir?— \\r\\nSir, you have wrestled well and overthrown \\r\\nMore than your enemies.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nWill you go, coz?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nHave with you.—Fare you well.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n[ Exeunt  Rosalind  and\\r\\n Celia . ]\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nWhat passion hangs these weights upon my tongue? \\r\\nI cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference. \\r\\nO poor Orlando, thou art overthrown. \\r\\nOr Charles or something weaker masters thee.\\r\\n \\r\\n Enter  Le Beau . \\r\\n \\r\\nLE BEAU. \\r\\nGood sir, I do in friendship counsel you \\r\\nTo leave this place. Albeit you have deserved \\r\\nHigh commendation, true applause, and love, \\r\\nYet such is now the Duke’s condition \\r\\nThat he misconsters all that you have done. \\r\\nThe Duke is humorous; what he is indeed \\r\\nMore suits you to conceive than I to speak of.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nI thank you, sir; and pray you tell me this: \\r\\nWhich of the two was daughter of the Duke \\r\\nThat here was at the wrestling?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nLE BEAU. \\r\\nNeither his daughter, if we judge by manners, \\r\\nBut yet indeed the smaller is his daughter. \\r\\nThe other is daughter to the banished Duke, \\r\\nAnd here detained by her usurping uncle \\r\\nTo keep his daughter company, whose loves \\r\\nAre dearer than the natural bond of sisters. \\r\\nBut I can tell you that of late this Duke \\r\\nHath ta’en displeasure ’gainst his gentle niece, \\r\\nGrounded upon no other argument \\r\\nBut that the people praise her for her virtues \\r\\nAnd pity her for her good father’s sake; \\r\\nAnd, on my life, his malice ’gainst the lady \\r\\nWill suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well. \\r\\nHereafter, in a better world than this, \\r\\nI shall desire more love and knowledge of you.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nI rest much bounden to you; fare you well!\\r\\n \\r\\n [ Exit  Le Beau . ] \\r\\n \\r\\nThus must I from the smoke into the smother, \\r\\nFrom tyrant Duke unto a tyrant brother. \\r\\nBut heavenly Rosalind!\\r\\n \\r\\n [ Exit. ] \\r\\n     SCENE III. A Room in the Palace  \\r\\n \\r\\nEnter  Celia  and\\r\\n Rosalind .\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nWhy, cousin, why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! Not a word?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nNot one to throw at a dog.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nNo, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs. Throw some of them at\\r\\nme. Come, lame me with reasons.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nThen there were two cousins laid up, when the one should be lamed with reasons\\r\\nand the other mad without any.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nBut is all this for your father?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nNo, some of it is for my child’s father. O, how full of briers is this\\r\\nworking-day world!\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nThey are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in holiday foolery. If we walk not\\r\\nin the trodden paths, our very petticoats will catch them.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nI could shake them off my coat; these burs are in my heart.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nHem them away.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nI would try, if I could cry “hem” and have him.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nCome, come, wrestle with thy affections.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nO, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nO, a good wish upon you! You will try in time, in despite of a fall. But\\r\\nturning these jests out of service, let us talk in good earnest. Is it\\r\\npossible on such a sudden you should fall into so strong a liking with old\\r\\nSir Rowland’s youngest son?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nThe Duke my father loved his father dearly.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nDoth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly? By this kind of\\r\\nchase I should hate him, for my father hated his father dearly; yet I hate not\\r\\nOrlando.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nNo, faith, hate him not, for my sake.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nWhy should I not? Doth he not deserve well?\\r\\n \\r\\n Enter  Duke Frederick  with Lords. \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nLet me love him for that, and do you love him because I do.—Look, here comes\\r\\nthe Duke.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nWith his eyes full of anger.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK. \\r\\nMistress, dispatch you with your safest haste, \\r\\nAnd get you from our court.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nMe, uncle?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK. \\r\\nYou, cousin. \\r\\nWithin these ten days if that thou be’st found \\r\\nSo near our public court as twenty miles, \\r\\nThou diest for it.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nI do beseech your Grace, \\r\\nLet me the knowledge of my fault bear with me. \\r\\nIf with myself I hold intelligence, \\r\\nOr have acquaintance with mine own desires, \\r\\nIf that I do not dream, or be not frantic— \\r\\nAs I do trust I am not—then, dear uncle, \\r\\nNever so much as in a thought unborn \\r\\nDid I offend your Highness.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK. \\r\\nThus do all traitors. \\r\\nIf their purgation did consist in words, \\r\\nThey are as innocent as grace itself. \\r\\nLet it suffice thee that I trust thee not.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nYet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor. \\r\\nTell me whereon the likelihood depends.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK. \\r\\nThou art thy father’s daughter, there’s enough.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nSo was I when your highness took his dukedom; \\r\\nSo was I when your highness banished him. \\r\\nTreason is not inherited, my lord, \\r\\nOr, if we did derive it from our friends, \\r\\nWhat’s that to me? My father was no traitor. \\r\\nThen, good my liege, mistake me not so much \\r\\nTo think my poverty is treacherous.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nDear sovereign, hear me speak.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK. \\r\\nAy, Celia, we stayed her for your sake, \\r\\nElse had she with her father ranged along.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nI did not then entreat to have her stay; \\r\\nIt was your pleasure and your own remorse. \\r\\nI was too young that time to value her, \\r\\nBut now I know her. If she be a traitor, \\r\\nWhy, so am I. We still have slept together, \\r\\nRose at an instant, learned, played, ate together, \\r\\nAnd wheresoe’er we went, like Juno’s swans, \\r\\nStill we went coupled and inseparable.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK. \\r\\nShe is too subtle for thee, and her smoothness, \\r\\nHer very silence, and her patience \\r\\nSpeak to the people, and they pity her. \\r\\nThou art a fool. She robs thee of thy name, \\r\\nAnd thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous \\r\\nWhen she is gone. Then open not thy lips. \\r\\nFirm and irrevocable is my doom \\r\\nWhich I have passed upon her. She is banished.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nPronounce that sentence then on me, my liege. \\r\\nI cannot live out of her company.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK. \\r\\nYou are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself. \\r\\nIf you outstay the time, upon mine honour \\r\\nAnd in the greatness of my word, you die.\\r\\n \\r\\n [ Exeunt  Duke Frederick \\r\\nand Lords. ] \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nO my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go? \\r\\nWilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine. \\r\\nI charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nI have more cause.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nThou hast not, cousin. \\r\\nPrithee be cheerful. Know’st thou not the Duke \\r\\nHath banished me, his daughter?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nThat he hath not.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nNo, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love \\r\\nWhich teacheth thee that thou and I am one. \\r\\nShall we be sundered? Shall we part, sweet girl? \\r\\nNo, let my father seek another heir. \\r\\nTherefore devise with me how we may fly, \\r\\nWhither to go, and what to bear with us, \\r\\nAnd do not seek to take your change upon you, \\r\\nTo bear your griefs yourself and leave me out. \\r\\nFor, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale, \\r\\nSay what thou canst, I’ll go along with thee.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nWhy, whither shall we go?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nTo seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nAlas, what danger will it be to us, \\r\\nMaids as we are, to travel forth so far? \\r\\nBeauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nI’ll put myself in poor and mean attire, \\r\\nAnd with a kind of umber smirch my face. \\r\\nThe like do you; so shall we pass along \\r\\nAnd never stir assailants.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nWere it not better, \\r\\nBecause that I am more than common tall, \\r\\nThat I did suit me all points like a man? \\r\\nA gallant curtal-axe upon my thigh, \\r\\nA boar-spear in my hand, and in my heart \\r\\nLie there what hidden woman’s fear there will, \\r\\nWe’ll have a swashing and a martial outside, \\r\\nAs many other mannish cowards have \\r\\nThat do outface it with their semblances.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nWhat shall I call thee when thou art a man?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nI’ll have no worse a name than Jove’s own page, \\r\\nAnd therefore look you call me Ganymede. \\r\\nBut what will you be called?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nSomething that hath a reference to my state: \\r\\nNo longer Celia, but Aliena.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nBut, cousin, what if we assayed to steal \\r\\nThe clownish fool out of your father’s court? \\r\\nWould he not be a comfort to our travel?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nHe’ll go along o’er the wide world with me. \\r\\nLeave me alone to woo him. Let’s away, \\r\\nAnd get our jewels and our wealth together, \\r\\nDevise the fittest time and safest way \\r\\nTo hide us from pursuit that will be made \\r\\nAfter my flight. Now go we in content \\r\\nTo liberty, and not to banishment.\\r\\n \\r\\n [ Exeunt. ] \\r\\n  \\r\\n \\r\\n     ACT II  \\r\\n   SCENE I.

Are not these woods \\r\\nMore free from peril than the envious court? \\r\\nHere feel we not the penalty of Adam, \\r\\nThe seasons’ difference, as the icy fang \\r\\nAnd churlish chiding of the winter’s wind, \\r\\nWhich when it bites and blows upon my body \\r\\nEven till I shrink with cold, I smile and say: \\r\\n“This is no flattery. These are counsellors \\r\\nThat feelingly persuade me what I am.” \\r\\nSweet are the uses of adversity, \\r\\nWhich, like the toad, ugly and venomous, \\r\\nWears yet a precious jewel in his head; \\r\\nAnd this our life, exempt from public haunt, \\r\\nFinds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, \\r\\nSermons in stones, and good in everything.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nAMIENS. \\r\\nI would not change it. Happy is your grace, \\r\\nThat can translate the stubbornness of fortune \\r\\nInto so quiet and so sweet a style.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE SENIOR. \\r\\nCome, shall we go and kill us venison? \\r\\nAnd yet it irks me the poor dappled fools, \\r\\nBeing native burghers of this desert city, \\r\\nShould in their own confines with forked heads \\r\\nHave their round haunches gored.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nFIRST LORD. \\r\\nIndeed, my lord, \\r\\nThe melancholy Jaques grieves at that, \\r\\nAnd in that kind swears you do more usurp \\r\\nThan doth your brother that hath banished you. \\r\\nToday my lord of Amiens and myself \\r\\nDid steal behind him as he lay along \\r\\nUnder an oak, whose antique root peeps out \\r\\nUpon the brook that brawls along this wood; \\r\\nTo the which place a poor sequestered stag, \\r\\nThat from the hunter’s aim had ta’en a hurt, \\r\\nDid come to languish; and indeed, my lord, \\r\\nThe wretched animal heaved forth such groans \\r\\nThat their discharge did stretch his leathern coat \\r\\nAlmost to bursting, and the big round tears \\r\\nCoursed one another down his innocent nose \\r\\nIn piteous chase. And thus the hairy fool, \\r\\nMuch marked of the melancholy Jaques, \\r\\nStood on th’ extremest verge of the swift brook, \\r\\nAugmenting it with tears.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE SENIOR. \\r\\nBut what said Jaques? \\r\\nDid he not moralize this spectacle?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nFIRST LORD. \\r\\nO yes, into a thousand similes. \\r\\nFirst, for his weeping into the needless stream: \\r\\n“Poor deer,” quoth he “thou mak’st a testament \\r\\nAs worldlings do, giving thy sum of more \\r\\nTo that which had too much.” Then, being there alone, \\r\\nLeft and abandoned of his velvet friends: \\r\\n“’Tis right”; quoth he, “thus misery doth part \\r\\nThe flux of company.” Anon a careless herd, \\r\\nFull of the pasture, jumps along by him \\r\\nAnd never stays to greet him. “Ay,” quoth Jaques, \\r\\n“Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens! \\r\\n’Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you look \\r\\nUpon that poor and broken bankrupt there?” \\r\\nThus most invectively he pierceth through \\r\\nThe body of the country, city, court, \\r\\nYea, and of this our life, swearing that we \\r\\nAre mere usurpers, tyrants, and what’s worse, \\r\\nTo fright the animals and to kill them up \\r\\nIn their assigned and native dwelling-place.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE SENIOR. \\r\\nAnd did you leave him in this contemplation?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nSECOND LORD. \\r\\nWe did, my lord, weeping and commenting \\r\\nUpon the sobbing deer.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE SENIOR. \\r\\nShow me the place. \\r\\nI love to cope him in these sullen fits, \\r\\nFor then he’s full of matter.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nFIRST LORD. \\r\\nI’ll bring you to him straight.\\r\\n \\r\\n [ Exeunt. ] \\r\\n     SCENE II. A Room in the Palace  \\r\\n Enter  Duke Frederick  with\\r\\nLords. \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK. \\r\\nCan it be possible that no man saw them? \\r\\nIt cannot be! Some villains of my court \\r\\nAre of consent and sufferance in this.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nFIRST LORD. \\r\\nI cannot hear of any that did see her. \\r\\nThe ladies, her attendants of her chamber, \\r\\nSaw her abed, and in the morning early \\r\\nThey found the bed untreasured of their mistress.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nSECOND LORD. \\r\\nMy lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft \\r\\nYour grace was wont to laugh, is also missing. \\r\\nHesperia, the princess’ gentlewoman, \\r\\nConfesses that she secretly o’erheard \\r\\nYour daughter and her cousin much commend \\r\\nThe parts and graces of the wrestler \\r\\nThat did but lately foil the sinewy Charles; \\r\\nAnd she believes wherever they are gone \\r\\nThat youth is surely in their company.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE FREDERICK. \\r\\nSend to his brother; fetch that gallant hither. \\r\\nIf he be absent, bring his brother to me. \\r\\nI’ll make him find him. Do this suddenly! \\r\\nAnd let not search and inquisition quail \\r\\nTo bring again these foolish runaways.\\r\\n \\r\\n [ Exeunt. ] \\r\\n     SCENE III. Before Oliver’s House  \\r\\n \\r\\nEnter  Orlando  and\\r\\n Adam , meeting.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nWho’s there?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nADAM. \\r\\nWhat, my young master? O my gentle master, \\r\\nO my sweet master, O you memory \\r\\nOf old Sir Rowland! Why, what make you here? \\r\\nWhy are you virtuous? Why do people love you? \\r\\nAnd wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant? \\r\\nWhy would you be so fond to overcome \\r\\nThe bonny prizer of the humorous Duke? \\r\\nYour praise is come too swiftly home before you. \\r\\nKnow you not, master, to some kind of men \\r\\nTheir graces serve them but as enemies? \\r\\nNo more do yours. Your virtues, gentle master, \\r\\nAre sanctified and holy traitors to you. \\r\\nO, what a world is this, when what is comely \\r\\nEnvenoms him that bears it!\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nWhy, what’s the matter?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nADAM. \\r\\nO unhappy youth, \\r\\nCome not within these doors! Within this roof \\r\\nThe enemy of all your graces lives. \\r\\nYour brother—no, no brother, yet the son— \\r\\nYet not the son; I will not call him son— \\r\\nOf him I was about to call his father, \\r\\nHath heard your praises, and this night he means \\r\\nTo burn the lodging where you use to lie, \\r\\nAnd you within it. If he fail of that, \\r\\nHe will have other means to cut you off; \\r\\nI overheard him and his practices. \\r\\nThis is no place; this house is but a butchery. \\r\\nAbhor it, fear it, do not enter it.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nWhy, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nADAM. \\r\\nNo matter whither, so you come not here.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nWhat, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food, \\r\\nOr with a base and boisterous sword enforce \\r\\nA thievish living on the common road? \\r\\nThis I must do, or know not what to do. \\r\\nYet this I will not do, do how I can. \\r\\nI rather will subject me to the malice \\r\\nOf a diverted blood and bloody brother.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nADAM. \\r\\nBut do not so. I have five hundred crowns, \\r\\nThe thrifty hire I saved under your father, \\r\\nWhich I did store to be my foster-nurse, \\r\\nWhen service should in my old limbs lie lame, \\r\\nAnd unregarded age in corners thrown. \\r\\nTake that, and He that doth the ravens feed, \\r\\nYea, providently caters for the sparrow, \\r\\nBe comfort to my age. Here is the gold. \\r\\nAll this I give you. Let me be your servant. \\r\\nThough I look old, yet I am strong and lusty, \\r\\nFor in my youth I never did apply \\r\\nHot and rebellious liquors in my blood, \\r\\nNor did not with unbashful forehead woo \\r\\nThe means of weakness and debility. \\r\\nTherefore my age is as a lusty winter, \\r\\nFrosty but kindly. Let me go with you. \\r\\nI’ll do the service of a younger man \\r\\nIn all your business and necessities.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nO good old man, how well in thee appears \\r\\nThe constant service of the antique world, \\r\\nWhen service sweat for duty, not for meed. \\r\\nThou art not for the fashion of these times, \\r\\nWhere none will sweat but for promotion, \\r\\nAnd having that do choke their service up \\r\\nEven with the having. It is not so with thee. \\r\\nBut, poor old man, thou prun’st a rotten tree, \\r\\nThat cannot so much as a blossom yield \\r\\nIn lieu of all thy pains and husbandry. \\r\\nBut come thy ways, we’ll go along together, \\r\\nAnd ere we have thy youthful wages spent \\r\\nWe’ll light upon some settled low content.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nADAM. \\r\\nMaster, go on and I will follow thee \\r\\nTo the last gasp with truth and loyalty. \\r\\nFrom seventeen years till now almost fourscore \\r\\nHere lived I, but now live here no more. \\r\\nAt seventeen years many their fortunes seek, \\r\\nBut at fourscore it is too late a week. \\r\\nYet fortune cannot recompense me better \\r\\nThan to die well and not my master’s debtor.\\r\\n \\r\\n [ Exeunt. ] \\r\\n     SCENE IV. The Forest of Arden  \\r\\n \\r\\nEnter  Rosalind  as Ganymede,\\r\\n Celia  as Aliena, and\\r\\n Touchstone .\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nO Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nI care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nI could find in my heart to disgrace my man’s apparel, and to cry like a woman,\\r\\nbut I must comfort the weaker vessel, as doublet and hose ought to show itself\\r\\ncourageous to petticoat. Therefore, courage, good Aliena.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nI pray you bear with me, I cannot go no further.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nFor my part, I had rather bear with you than bear you. Yet I should bear no\\r\\ncross if I did bear you, for I think you have no money in your purse.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nWell, this is the forest of Arden.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nAy, now am I in Arden, the more fool I! When I was at home I was in a better\\r\\nplace, but travellers must be content.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nEnter  Corin  and\\r\\n Silvius .\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nAy, be so, good Touchstone. Look you, who comes here? A young man and an old\\r\\nin solemn talk.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCORIN. \\r\\nThat is the way to make her scorn you still.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nSILVIUS. \\r\\nO Corin, that thou knew’st how I do love her!\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCORIN. \\r\\nI partly guess, for I have loved ere now.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nSILVIUS. \\r\\nNo, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess, \\r\\nThough in thy youth thou wast as true a lover \\r\\nAs ever sighed upon a midnight pillow. \\r\\nBut if thy love were ever like to mine— \\r\\nAs sure I think did never man love so— \\r\\nHow many actions most ridiculous \\r\\nHast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCORIN. \\r\\nInto a thousand that I have forgotten.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nSILVIUS. \\r\\nO, thou didst then never love so heartily! \\r\\nIf thou rememb’rest not the slightest folly \\r\\nThat ever love did make thee run into, \\r\\nThou hast not loved. \\r\\nOr if thou hast not sat as I do now, \\r\\nWearing thy hearer in thy mistress’ praise, \\r\\nThou hast not loved. \\r\\nOr if thou hast not broke from company \\r\\nAbruptly, as my passion now makes me, \\r\\nThou hast not loved. \\r\\nO Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe!\\r\\n \\r\\n [ Exit  Silvius . ] \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nAlas, poor shepherd, searching of thy wound, \\r\\nI have by hard adventure found mine own.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nAnd I mine. I remember when I was in love I broke my sword upon a stone and\\r\\nbid him take that for coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I remember the kissing\\r\\nof her batlet, and the cow’s dugs that her pretty chopped hands had milked; and\\r\\nI remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took two cods,\\r\\nand, giving her them again, said with weeping tears, “Wear these for my sake.”\\r\\nWe that are true lovers run into strange capers. But as all is mortal in\\r\\nnature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nThou speak’st wiser than thou art ware of.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nNay, I shall ne’er be ware of mine own wit till I break my shins against it.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nJove, Jove, this shepherd’s passion \\r\\nIs much upon my fashion.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nAnd mine, but it grows something stale with me.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nI pray you, one of you question yond man \\r\\nIf he for gold will give us any food. \\r\\nI faint almost to death.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nHolla, you clown!\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nPeace, fool, he’s not thy kinsman.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCORIN. \\r\\nWho calls?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nYour betters, sir.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCORIN. \\r\\nElse are they very wretched.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nPeace, I say.—Good even to you, friend.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCORIN. \\r\\nAnd to you, gentle sir, and to you all.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nI prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold \\r\\nCan in this desert place buy entertainment, \\r\\nBring us where we may rest ourselves and feed. \\r\\nHere’s a young maid with travel much oppressed, \\r\\nAnd faints for succour.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCORIN. \\r\\nFair sir, I pity her \\r\\nAnd wish, for her sake more than for mine own, \\r\\nMy fortunes were more able to relieve her. \\r\\nBut I am shepherd to another man \\r\\nAnd do not shear the fleeces that I graze. \\r\\nMy master is of churlish disposition \\r\\nAnd little recks to find the way to heaven \\r\\nBy doing deeds of hospitality. \\r\\nBesides, his cote, his flocks, and bounds of feed \\r\\nAre now on sale, and at our sheepcote now, \\r\\nBy reason of his absence, there is nothing \\r\\nThat you will feed on. But what is, come see, \\r\\nAnd in my voice most welcome shall you be.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nWhat is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCORIN. \\r\\nThat young swain that you saw here but erewhile, \\r\\nThat little cares for buying anything.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nI pray thee, if it stand with honesty, \\r\\nBuy thou the cottage, pasture, and the flock, \\r\\nAnd thou shalt have to pay for it of us.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nAnd we will mend thy wages. I like this place, \\r\\nAnd willingly could waste my time in it.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCORIN. \\r\\nAssuredly the thing is to be sold. \\r\\nGo with me. If you like upon report \\r\\nThe soil, the profit, and this kind of life, \\r\\nI will your very faithful feeder be, \\r\\nAnd buy it with your gold right suddenly.\\r\\n \\r\\n [ Exeunt. ] \\r\\n     SCENE V. Another part of the Forest  \\r\\n Enter  Amiens, Jaques  and\\r\\nothers. \\r\\n \\r\\nAMIENS. \\r\\n[ Sings .]\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Under the greenwood tree, \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Who loves to lie with me \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0And turn his merry note \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Unto the sweet bird’s throat, \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Come hither, come hither, come hither! \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Here shall he see \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0No enemy \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0But winter and rough weather.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nMore, more, I prithee, more.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nAMIENS. \\r\\nIt will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nI thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck melancholy out of a song as a\\r\\nweasel sucks eggs. More, I prithee, more.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nAMIENS. \\r\\nMy voice is ragged. I know I cannot please you.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nI do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to sing. Come, more, another\\r\\n stanzo . Call you ’em  stanzos? \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nAMIENS. \\r\\nWhat you will, Monsieur Jaques.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nNay, I care not for their names. They owe me nothing. Will you sing?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nAMIENS. \\r\\nMore at your request than to please myself.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nWell then, if ever I thank any man, I’ll thank you; but that they call\\r\\ncompliment is like th’ encounter of two dog-apes. And when a man thanks me\\r\\nheartily, methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me the beggarly\\r\\nthanks. Come, sing; and you that will not, hold your tongues.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nAMIENS. \\r\\nWell, I’ll end the song.—Sirs, cover the while. The Duke will drink under this\\r\\ntree; he hath been all this day to look you.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nAnd I have been all this day to avoid him. He is too disputable for my company.\\r\\nI think of as many matters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make no boast\\r\\nof them. Come, warble, come.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nAMIENS. \\r\\n[ Sings .]\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Who doth ambition shun \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0And loves to live i’ th’ sun, \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Seeking the food he eats \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0And pleased with what he gets, \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Come hither, come hither, come hither. \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Here shall he see \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0No enemy \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0But winter and rough weather.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nI’ll give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in despite of my\\r\\ninvention.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nAMIENS. \\r\\nAnd I’ll sing it.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nThus it goes:\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0If it do come to pass \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0That any man turn ass, \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Leaving his wealth and ease \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0A stubborn will to please, \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame; \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Here shall he see \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Gross fools as he, \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0An if he will come to me.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nAMIENS. \\r\\nWhat’s that “ducdame?”\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\n’Tis a Greek invocation to call fools into a circle.

Live a little, comfort a little,\\r\\ncheer thyself a little. If this uncouth forest yield anything savage, I will\\r\\neither be food for it or bring it for food to thee. Thy conceit is nearer death\\r\\nthan thy powers. For my sake, be comfortable. Hold death awhile at the arm’s\\r\\nend. I will here be with thee presently, and if I bring thee not something to\\r\\neat, I’ll give thee leave to die. But if thou diest before I come, thou art a\\r\\nmocker of my labour. Well said, thou look’st cheerly, and I’ll be with thee\\r\\nquickly. Yet thou liest in the bleak air. Come, I will bear thee to some\\r\\nshelter and thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner if there live anything in\\r\\nthis desert. Cheerly, good Adam!\\r\\n \\r\\n [ Exeunt. ] \\r\\n     SCENE VII. Another part of the Forest  \\r\\n Enter  Duke Senior, Amiens \\r\\nand  Lords  as outlaws. \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE SENIOR. \\r\\nI think he be transformed into a beast, \\r\\nFor I can nowhere find him like a man.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nFIRST LORD. \\r\\nMy lord, he is but even now gone hence; \\r\\nHere was he merry, hearing of a song.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE SENIOR. \\r\\nIf he, compact of jars, grow musical, \\r\\nWe shall have shortly discord in the spheres. \\r\\nGo seek him, tell him I would speak with him.\\r\\n \\r\\n Enter  Jaques . \\r\\n \\r\\nFIRST LORD. \\r\\nHe saves my labour by his own approach.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE SENIOR. \\r\\nWhy, how now, monsieur? What a life is this \\r\\nThat your poor friends must woo your company? \\r\\nWhat, you look merrily.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nA fool, a fool! I met a fool i’ th’ forest, \\r\\nA motley fool. A miserable world! \\r\\nAs I do live by food, I met a fool, \\r\\nWho laid him down and basked him in the sun, \\r\\nAnd railed on Lady Fortune in good terms, \\r\\nIn good set terms, and yet a motley fool. \\r\\n“Good morrow, fool,” quoth I. “No, sir,” quoth he, \\r\\n“Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune.” \\r\\nAnd then he drew a dial from his poke, \\r\\nAnd, looking on it with lack-lustre eye, \\r\\nSays very wisely, “It is ten o’clock. \\r\\nThus we may see,” quoth he, “how the world wags. \\r\\n’Tis but an hour ago since it was nine, \\r\\nAnd after one hour more ’twill be eleven. \\r\\nAnd so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe, \\r\\nAnd then from hour to hour we rot and rot, \\r\\nAnd thereby hangs a tale.” When I did hear \\r\\nThe motley fool thus moral on the time, \\r\\nMy lungs began to crow like chanticleer, \\r\\nThat fools should be so deep-contemplative, \\r\\nAnd I did laugh sans intermission \\r\\nAn hour by his dial. O noble fool! \\r\\nA worthy fool! Motley’s the only wear.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE SENIOR. \\r\\nWhat fool is this?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nO worthy fool!—One that hath been a courtier, \\r\\nAnd says if ladies be but young and fair, \\r\\nThey have the gift to know it. And in his brain, \\r\\nWhich is as dry as the remainder biscuit \\r\\nAfter a voyage, he hath strange places crammed \\r\\nWith observation, the which he vents \\r\\nIn mangled forms. O that I were a fool! \\r\\nI am ambitious for a motley coat.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE SENIOR. \\r\\nThou shalt have one.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nIt is my only suit, \\r\\nProvided that you weed your better judgements \\r\\nOf all opinion that grows rank in them \\r\\nThat I am wise. I must have liberty \\r\\nWithal, as large a charter as the wind, \\r\\nTo blow on whom I please, for so fools have. \\r\\nAnd they that are most galled with my folly, \\r\\nThey most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so? \\r\\nThe “why” is plain as way to parish church. \\r\\nHe that a fool doth very wisely hit \\r\\nDoth very foolishly, although he smart, \\r\\nNot to seem senseless of the bob.

How then, what then? Let me see wherein \\r\\nMy tongue hath wronged him. If it do him right, \\r\\nThen he hath wronged himself. If he be free, \\r\\nWhy then my taxing like a wild-goose flies \\r\\nUnclaimed of any man. But who comes here?\\r\\n \\r\\n Enter  Orlando  with sword\\r\\ndrawn. \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nForbear, and eat no more.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nWhy, I have eat none yet.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nNor shalt not till necessity be served.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nOf what kind should this cock come of?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE SENIOR. \\r\\nArt thou thus boldened, man, by thy distress? \\r\\nOr else a rude despiser of good manners, \\r\\nThat in civility thou seem’st so empty?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nYou touched my vein at first. The thorny point \\r\\nOf bare distress hath ta’en from me the show \\r\\nOf smooth civility; yet am I inland bred \\r\\nAnd know some nurture. But forbear, I say! \\r\\nHe dies that touches any of this fruit \\r\\nTill I and my affairs are answered.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nAn you will not be answered with reason, I must die.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE SENIOR. \\r\\nWhat would you have? Your gentleness shall force \\r\\nMore than your force move us to gentleness.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nI almost die for food, and let me have it.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE SENIOR. \\r\\nSit down and feed, and welcome to our table.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nSpeak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you. \\r\\nI thought that all things had been savage here \\r\\nAnd therefore put I on the countenance \\r\\nOf stern commandment. But whate’er you are \\r\\nThat in this desert inaccessible, \\r\\nUnder the shade of melancholy boughs, \\r\\nLose and neglect the creeping hours of time, \\r\\nIf ever you have looked on better days, \\r\\nIf ever been where bells have knolled to church, \\r\\nIf ever sat at any good man’s feast, \\r\\nIf ever from your eyelids wiped a tear, \\r\\nAnd know what ’tis to pity and be pitied, \\r\\nLet gentleness my strong enforcement be, \\r\\nIn the which hope I blush and hide my sword.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE SENIOR. \\r\\nTrue is it that we have seen better days, \\r\\nAnd have with holy bell been knolled to church, \\r\\nAnd sat at good men’s feasts, and wiped our eyes \\r\\nOf drops that sacred pity hath engendered. \\r\\nAnd therefore sit you down in gentleness, \\r\\nAnd take upon command what help we have \\r\\nThat to your wanting may be ministered.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nThen but forbear your food a little while, \\r\\nWhiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn, \\r\\nAnd give it food. There is an old poor man \\r\\nWho after me hath many a weary step \\r\\nLimped in pure love. Till he be first sufficed, \\r\\nOppressed with two weak evils, age and hunger, \\r\\nI will not touch a bit.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE SENIOR. \\r\\nGo find him out, \\r\\nAnd we will nothing waste till you return.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nI thank ye, and be blest for your good comfort.\\r\\n \\r\\n [ Exit. ] \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE SENIOR. \\r\\nThou seest we are not all alone unhappy. \\r\\nThis wide and universal theatre \\r\\nPresents more woeful pageants than the scene \\r\\nWherein we play in.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nAll the world’s a stage, \\r\\nAnd all the men and women merely players; \\r\\nThey have their exits and their entrances, \\r\\nAnd one man in his time plays many parts, \\r\\nHis acts being seven ages. At first the infant, \\r\\nMewling and puking in the nurse’s arms; \\r\\nThen the whining schoolboy, with his satchel \\r\\nAnd shining morning face, creeping like snail \\r\\nUnwillingly to school. And then the lover, \\r\\nSighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad \\r\\nMade to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier, \\r\\nFull of strange oaths and bearded like the pard, \\r\\nJealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel, \\r\\nSeeking the bubble reputation \\r\\nEven in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice, \\r\\nIn fair round belly with good capon lined, \\r\\nWith eyes severe and beard of formal cut, \\r\\nFull of wise saws and modern instances; \\r\\nAnd so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts \\r\\nInto the lean and slippered pantaloon, \\r\\nWith spectacles on nose and pouch on side, \\r\\nHis youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide \\r\\nFor his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice, \\r\\nTurning again toward childish treble, pipes \\r\\nAnd whistles in his sound. Last scene of all, \\r\\nThat ends this strange eventful history, \\r\\nIs second childishness and mere oblivion, \\r\\nSans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nEnter  Orlando  bearing\\r\\n Adam .\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE SENIOR. \\r\\nWelcome.

In respect that it is solitary, I like\\r\\nit very well; but in respect that it is private, it is a very vile life. Now in\\r\\nrespect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect it is not in\\r\\nthe court, it is tedious. As it is a spare life, look you, it fits my humour\\r\\nwell; but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much against my stomach.\\r\\nHast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCORIN. \\r\\nNo more but that I know the more one sickens, the worse at ease he is; and that\\r\\nhe that wants money, means, and content is without three good friends; that\\r\\nthe property of rain is to wet, and fire to burn; that good pasture makes fat\\r\\nsheep; and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that\\r\\nhath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding or comes\\r\\nof a very dull kindred.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nSuch a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in court, shepherd?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCORIN. \\r\\nNo, truly.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nThen thou art damned.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCORIN. \\r\\nNay, I hope.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nTruly, thou art damned, like an ill-roasted egg, all on one side.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCORIN. \\r\\nFor not being at court? Your reason.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nWhy, if thou never wast at court, thou never saw’st good manners; if thou never\\r\\nsaw’st good manners, then thy manners must be wicked, and wickedness is sin,\\r\\nand sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous state, shepherd.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCORIN. \\r\\nNot a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good manners at the court are as\\r\\nridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the country is most mockable at\\r\\nthe court. You told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands.\\r\\nThat courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nInstance, briefly. Come, instance.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCORIN. \\r\\nWhy, we are still handling our ewes, and their fells, you know, are greasy.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nWhy, do not your courtier’s hands sweat? And is not the grease of a mutton as\\r\\nwholesome as the sweat of a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say.\\r\\nCome.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCORIN. \\r\\nBesides, our hands are hard.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nYour lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again. A more sounder instance,\\r\\ncome.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCORIN. \\r\\nAnd they are often tarred over with the surgery of our sheep; and would you\\r\\nhave us kiss tar? The courtier’s hands are perfumed with civet.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nMost shallow man! Thou worm’s meat in respect of a good piece of flesh\\r\\nindeed! Learn of the wise and perpend. Civet is of a baser birth than tar, the\\r\\nvery uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCORIN. \\r\\nYou have too courtly a wit for me. I’ll rest.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nWilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man! God make incision in thee,\\r\\nthou art raw.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCORIN. \\r\\nSir, I am a true labourer. I earn that I eat, get that I wear, owe no man hate,\\r\\nenvy no man’s happiness, glad of other men’s good, content with my harm; and\\r\\nthe greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nThat is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes and the rams together and\\r\\nto offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a\\r\\nbell-wether and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to crooked-pated, old,\\r\\ncuckoldly ram, out of all reasonable match. If thou be’st not damned for this,\\r\\nthe devil himself will have no shepherds. I cannot see else how thou shouldst\\r\\n’scape.\\r\\n \\r\\n Enter  Rosalind  as Ganymede.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCORIN. \\r\\nHere comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress’s brother.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\n[ Reads .] \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 From the east to western Inde \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0No jewel is like Rosalind. \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Her worth being mounted on the wind, \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Through all the world bears Rosalind. \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0All the pictures fairest lined \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Are but black to Rosalind. \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Let no face be kept in mind \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0But the fair of Rosalind. \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nI’ll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and suppers and sleeping\\r\\nhours excepted.

The feet might bear the verses.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nAy, but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves without the verse,\\r\\nand therefore stood lamely in the verse.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nBut didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hanged and carved\\r\\nupon these trees?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nI was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you came; for look here\\r\\nwhat I found on a palm-tree. I was never so berhymed since Pythagoras’ time\\r\\nthat I was an Irish rat, which I can hardly remember.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nTrow you who hath done this?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nIs it a man?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nAnd a chain, that you once wore, about his neck. Change you colour?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nI prithee, who?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nO Lord, Lord, it is a hard matter for friends to meet; but mountains may be\\r\\nremoved with earthquakes and so encounter.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nNay, but who is it?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nIs it possible?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nNay, I prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell me who it is.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nO wonderful, wonderful, most wonderful wonderful, and yet again wonderful, and\\r\\nafter that, out of all whooping!\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nGood my complexion! Dost thou think, though I am caparisoned like a man, I have\\r\\na doublet and hose in my disposition? One inch of delay more is a South Sea of\\r\\ndiscovery. I prithee tell me who is it quickly, and speak apace. I would thou\\r\\ncouldst stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man out of thy mouth, as\\r\\nwine comes out of narrow-mouthed bottle—either too much at once or none at\\r\\nall. I prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that I may drink thy tidings.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nSo you may put a man in your belly.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nIs he of God’s making? What manner of man? Is his head worth a hat, or his chin\\r\\nworth a beard?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nNay, he hath but a little beard.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nWhy, God will send more if the man will be thankful. Let me stay the growth of\\r\\nhis beard, if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nIt is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler’s heels and your heart both\\r\\nin an instant.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nNay, but the devil take mocking! Speak sad brow and true maid.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nI’ faith, coz, ’tis he.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nOrlando?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nOrlando.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nAlas the day, what shall I do with my doublet and hose? What did he when thou\\r\\nsaw’st him? What said he? How looked he? Wherein went he? What makes he here?\\r\\nDid he ask for me? Where remains he? How parted he with thee? And when shalt\\r\\nthou see him again? Answer me in one word.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nYou must borrow me Gargantua’s mouth first. ’Tis a word too great for any mouth\\r\\nof this age’s size. To say ay and no to these particulars is more than to\\r\\nanswer in a catechism.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nBut doth he know that I am in this forest and in man’s apparel? Looks he as\\r\\nfreshly as he did the day he wrestled?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nIt is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the propositions of a lover. But\\r\\ntake a taste of my finding him, and relish it with good observance. I found him\\r\\nunder a tree, like a dropped acorn.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nIt may well be called Jove’s tree when it drops forth such fruit.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nGive me audience, good madam.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nProceed.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nThere lay he, stretched along like a wounded knight.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nThough it be pity to see such a sight, it well becomes the ground.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nCry “holla!” to thy tongue, I prithee. It curvets unseasonably. He was\\r\\nfurnished like a hunter.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nO, ominous! He comes to kill my heart.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nI would sing my song without a burden. Thou bring’st me out of tune.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nDo you not know I am a woman? When I think, I must speak. Sweet, say on.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nEnter  Orlando  and\\r\\n Jaques .\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nYou bring me out. Soft, comes he not here?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\n’Tis he! Slink by, and note him.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n[  Rosalind  and\\r\\n Celia  step aside. ]\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nI thank you for your company but, good faith, I had as lief have been myself\\r\\nalone.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nAnd so had I, but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you too for your society.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nGod be wi’ you, let’s meet as little as we can.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nI do desire we may be better strangers.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nI pray you, mar no more trees with writing love songs in their barks.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nI pray you, mar no more of my verses with reading them ill-favouredly.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nRosalind is your love’s name?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nYes, just.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nI do not like her name.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nThere was no thought of pleasing you when she was christened.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nWhat stature is she of?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nJust as high as my heart.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nYou are full of pretty answers. Have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths’\\r\\nwives, and conned them out of rings?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nNot so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from whence you have studied your\\r\\nquestions.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nYou have a nimble wit. I think ’twas made of Atalanta’s heels. Will you sit\\r\\ndown with me? And we two will rail against our mistress the world and all our\\r\\nmisery.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nI will chide no breather in the world but myself, against whom I know most\\r\\nfaults.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nThe worst fault you have is to be in love.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\n’Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue. I am weary of you.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nBy my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found you.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nHe is drowned in the brook. Look but in, and you shall see him.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nThere I shall see mine own figure.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nWhich I take to be either a fool or a cipher.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nI’ll tarry no longer with you. Farewell, good Signior Love.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nI am glad of your departure. Adieu, good Monsieur Melancholy.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n[ Exit  Jaques .— Celia \\r\\nand  Rosalind  come forward. ]\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nI will speak to him like a saucy lackey, and under that habit play the knave\\r\\nwith him. \\r\\nDo you hear, forester?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nVery well. What would you?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nI pray you, what is’t o’clock?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nYou should ask me what time o’ day. There’s no clock in the forest.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nThen there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing every minute and\\r\\ngroaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nAnd why not the swift foot of time? Had not that been as proper?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nBy no means, sir. Time travels in divers paces with divers persons. I’ll tell\\r\\nyou who time ambles withal, who time trots withal, who time gallops withal, and\\r\\nwho he stands still withal.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nI prithee, who doth he trot withal?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nMarry, he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and\\r\\nthe day it is solemnized. If the interim be but a se’nnight, time’s pace is so\\r\\nhard that it seems the length of seven year.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nWho ambles time withal?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nWith a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath not the gout; for the\\r\\none sleeps easily because he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because\\r\\nhe feels no pain; the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning, the\\r\\nother knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury. These time ambles withal.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nWho doth he gallop withal?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nWith a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly as foot can fall, he\\r\\nthinks himself too soon there.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nWho stays it still withal?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nWith lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep between term and term, and then\\r\\nthey perceive not how time moves.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nWhere dwell you, pretty youth?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nWith this shepherdess, my sister, here in the skirts of the forest, like fringe\\r\\nupon a petticoat.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nAre you native of this place?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nAs the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nYour accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a\\r\\ndwelling.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nI have been told so of many. But indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught\\r\\nme to speak, who was in his youth an inland man, one that knew courtship too\\r\\nwell, for there he fell in love. I have heard him read many lectures against\\r\\nit, and I thank God I am not a woman, to be touched with so many giddy offences\\r\\nas he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nCan you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of\\r\\nwomen?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nThere were none principal. They were all like one another as halfpence are,\\r\\nevery one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nI prithee recount some of them.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nNo. I will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick. There is a man\\r\\nhaunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving “Rosalind” on their\\r\\nbarks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles; all, forsooth,\\r\\ndeifying the name of Rosalind. If I could meet that fancy-monger, I would give\\r\\nhim some good counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nI am he that is so love-shaked. I pray you tell me your remedy.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nThere is none of my uncle’s marks upon you. He taught me how to know a man in\\r\\nlove, in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nWhat were his marks?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nA lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken, which you have not; an\\r\\nunquestionable spirit, which you have not; a beard neglected, which you have\\r\\nnot—but I pardon you for that, for simply your having in beard is a younger\\r\\nbrother’s revenue. Then your hose should be ungartered, your bonnet unbanded,\\r\\nyour sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe untied, and everything about you\\r\\ndemonstrating a careless desolation. But you are no such man. You are rather\\r\\npoint-device in your accoutrements, as loving yourself than seeming the lover\\r\\nof any other.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nFair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nMe believe it? You may as soon make her that you love believe it, which I\\r\\nwarrant she is apter to do than to confess she does. That is one of the points\\r\\nin the which women still give the lie to their consciences. But, in good sooth,\\r\\nare you he that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind is so admired?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nI swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I am that he, that\\r\\nunfortunate he.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nBut are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nNeither rhyme nor reason can express how much.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nLove is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a\\r\\nwhip as madmen do; and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is\\r\\nthat the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too. Yet I profess\\r\\ncuring it by counsel.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nDid you ever cure any so?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nYes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me his love, his mistress, and\\r\\nI set him every day to woo me; at which time would I, being but a moonish\\r\\nyouth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing and liking, proud,\\r\\nfantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; for\\r\\nevery passion something and for no passion truly anything, as boys and women\\r\\nare for the most part cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe\\r\\nhim; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep for him, then spit at him;\\r\\nthat I drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of\\r\\nmadness, which was to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a\\r\\nnook merely monastic. And thus I cured him, and this way will I take upon me to\\r\\nwash your liver as clean as a sound sheep’s heart, that there shall not be one\\r\\nspot of love in ’t.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nI would not be cured, youth.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nI would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind and come every day to my\\r\\ncote and woo me.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nNow, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it is.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nGo with me to it, and I’ll show it you; and by the way you shall tell me\\r\\nwhere in the forest you live. Will you go?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nWith all my heart, good youth.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nNay, you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?\\r\\n \\r\\n [ Exeunt. ] \\r\\n     SCENE III. Another part of the Forest  \\r\\n \\r\\nEnter  Touchstone  and\\r\\n Audrey; Jaques  at a distance observing them.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nCome apace, good Audrey. I will fetch up your goats, Audrey. And how, Audrey?\\r\\nAm I the man yet? Doth my simple feature content you?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nAUDREY. \\r\\nYour features, Lord warrant us! What features?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nI am here with thee and thy goats, as the most capricious poet, honest Ovid,\\r\\nwas among the Goths.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\n[ Aside .] O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove in a thatched house!\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nWhen a man’s verses cannot be understood, nor a man’s good wit seconded with\\r\\nthe forward child, understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a great\\r\\nreckoning in a little room. Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nAUDREY. \\r\\nI do not know what “poetical” is. Is it honest in deed and word? Is it a true\\r\\nthing?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nNo, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning, and lovers are given to\\r\\npoetry, and what they swear in poetry may be said, as lovers, they do feign.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nAUDREY. \\r\\nDo you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nI do, truly, for thou swear’st to me thou art honest. Now if thou wert a poet,\\r\\nI might have some hope thou didst feign.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nAUDREY. \\r\\nWould you not have me honest?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nNo, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; for honesty coupled to beauty is to\\r\\nhave honey a sauce to sugar.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\n[ Aside .] A material fool!\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nAUDREY. \\r\\nWell, I am not fair, and therefore I pray the gods make me honest.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nTruly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an\\r\\nunclean dish.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nAUDREY. \\r\\nI am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nWell, praised be the gods for thy foulness; sluttishness may come hereafter.\\r\\nBut be it as it may be, I will marry thee. And to that end I have been with Sir\\r\\nOliver Martext, the vicar of the next village, who hath promised to meet me in\\r\\nthis place of the forest and to couple us.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\n[ Aside .] I would fain see this meeting.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nAUDREY. \\r\\nWell, the gods give us joy!\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nAmen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger in this attempt, for\\r\\nhere we have no temple but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what\\r\\nthough? Courage! As horns are odious, they are necessary. It is said, “Many a\\r\\nman knows no end of his goods.” Right. Many a man has good horns and knows no\\r\\nend of them. Well, that is the dowry of his wife; ’tis none of his own getting.\\r\\nHorns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no, the noblest deer hath them as huge as\\r\\nthe rascal. Is the single man therefore blessed? No. As a walled town is more\\r\\nworthier than a village, so is the forehead of a married man more honourable\\r\\nthan the bare brow of a bachelor. And by how much defence is better than no\\r\\nskill, by so much is horn more precious than to want.\\r\\n \\r\\n Enter  Sir Oliver Martext . \\r\\n \\r\\nHere comes Sir Oliver. Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met. Will you dispatch\\r\\nus here under this tree, or shall we go with you to your chapel?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nMARTEXT. \\r\\nIs there none here to give the woman?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nI will not take her on gift of any man.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nMARTEXT. \\r\\nTruly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\n[ Coming forward .] Proceed, proceed. I’ll give her.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nGood even, good Master What-ye-call’t, how do you, sir? You are very well\\r\\nmet. God ’ild you for your last company. I am very glad to see you. Even a toy\\r\\nin hand here, sir. Nay, pray be covered.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nWill you be married, motley?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nAs the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and the falcon her bells, so\\r\\nman hath his desires; and as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nAnd will you, being a man of your breeding, be married under a bush like a\\r\\nbeggar? Get you to church, and have a good priest that can tell you what\\r\\nmarriage is. This fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot; then\\r\\none of you will prove a shrunk panel, and like green timber, warp, warp.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\n[ Aside .] I am not in the mind but I were better to be married of him than of\\r\\nanother, for he is not like to marry me well, and not being well married, it\\r\\nwill be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nGo thou with me, and let me counsel thee.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nCome, sweet Audrey. We must be married, or we must live in bawdry. \\r\\nFarewell, good Master Oliver.

Ne’er a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my\\r\\ncalling.\\r\\n \\r\\n [ Exit. ] \\r\\n     SCENE IV. Another part of the Forest. Before a Cottage  \\r\\n \\r\\nEnter  Rosalind  and\\r\\n Celia .\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nNever talk to me, I will weep.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nDo, I prithee, but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a\\r\\nman.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nBut have I not cause to weep?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nAs good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nHis very hair is of the dissembling colour.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nSomething browner than Judas’s. Marry, his kisses are Judas’s own children.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nI’ faith, his hair is of a good colour.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nAn excellent colour. Your chestnut was ever the only colour.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nAnd his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nHe hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana. A nun of winter’s sisterhood\\r\\nkisses not more religiously; the very ice of chastity is in them.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nBut why did he swear he would come this morning, and comes not?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nNay, certainly, there is no truth in him.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nDo you think so?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nYes. I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer, but for his verity in\\r\\nlove, I do think him as concave as a covered goblet or a worm-eaten nut.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nNot true in love?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nYes, when he is in, but I think he is not in.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nYou have heard him swear downright he was.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\n“Was” is not “is”. Besides, the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of\\r\\na tapster. They are both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends here in\\r\\nthe forest on the Duke your father.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nI met the Duke yesterday, and had much question with him. He asked me of what\\r\\nparentage I was. I told him, of as good as he, so he laughed and let me go. But\\r\\nwhat talk we of fathers when there is such a man as Orlando?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nO, that’s a brave man! He writes brave verses, speaks brave words, swears brave\\r\\noaths, and breaks them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of his lover,\\r\\nas a puny tilter, that spurs his horse but on one side, breaks his staff like a\\r\\nnoble goose. But all’s brave that youth mounts and folly guides. Who comes\\r\\nhere?\\r\\n \\r\\n Enter  Corin . \\r\\n \\r\\nCORIN. \\r\\nMistress and master, you have oft enquired \\r\\nAfter the shepherd that complained of love, \\r\\nWho you saw sitting by me on the turf, \\r\\nPraising the proud disdainful shepherdess \\r\\nThat was his mistress.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nWell, and what of him?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCORIN. \\r\\nIf you will see a pageant truly played \\r\\nBetween the pale complexion of true love \\r\\nAnd the red glow of scorn and proud disdain, \\r\\nGo hence a little, and I shall conduct you, \\r\\nIf you will mark it.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nO, come, let us remove. \\r\\nThe sight of lovers feedeth those in love. \\r\\nBring us to this sight, and you shall say \\r\\nI’ll prove a busy actor in their play.\\r\\n \\r\\n [ Exeunt. ] \\r\\n     SCENE V. Another part of the Forest  \\r\\n \\r\\nEnter  Silvius  and\\r\\n Phoebe .\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nSILVIUS. \\r\\nSweet Phoebe, do not scorn me, do not, Phoebe. \\r\\nSay that you love me not, but say not so \\r\\nIn bitterness. The common executioner, \\r\\nWhose heart th’ accustomed sight of death makes hard, \\r\\nFalls not the axe upon the humbled neck \\r\\nBut first begs pardon. Will you sterner be \\r\\nThan he that dies and lives by bloody drops?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nEnter  Rosalind, Celia  and\\r\\n Corin , at a distance.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nPHOEBE. \\r\\nI would not be thy executioner; \\r\\nI fly thee, for I would not injure thee. \\r\\nThou tell’st me there is murder in mine eye. \\r\\n’Tis pretty, sure, and very probable \\r\\nThat eyes, that are the frail’st and softest things, \\r\\nWho shut their coward gates on atomies, \\r\\nShould be called tyrants, butchers, murderers. \\r\\nNow I do frown on thee with all my heart, \\r\\nAnd if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee. \\r\\nNow counterfeit to swoon; why, now fall down; \\r\\nOr if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame, \\r\\nLie not, to say mine eyes are murderers. \\r\\nNow show the wound mine eye hath made in thee. \\r\\nScratch thee but with a pin, and there remains \\r\\nSome scar of it; lean upon a rush, \\r\\nThe cicatrice and capable impressure \\r\\nThy palm some moment keeps. But now mine eyes, \\r\\nWhich I have darted at thee, hurt thee not; \\r\\nNor I am sure there is not force in eyes \\r\\nThat can do hurt.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nSILVIUS. \\r\\nO dear Phoebe, \\r\\nIf ever—as that ever may be near— \\r\\nYou meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy, \\r\\nThen shall you know the wounds invisible \\r\\nThat love’s keen arrows make.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nPHOEBE. \\r\\nBut till that time \\r\\nCome not thou near me. And when that time comes, \\r\\nAfflict me with thy mocks, pity me not, \\r\\nAs till that time I shall not pity thee.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\n[ Advancing .] And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother, \\r\\nThat you insult, exult, and all at once, \\r\\nOver the wretched? What though you have no beauty— \\r\\nAs, by my faith, I see no more in you \\r\\nThan without candle may go dark to bed— \\r\\nMust you be therefore proud and pitiless? \\r\\nWhy, what means this? Why do you look on me? \\r\\nI see no more in you than in the ordinary \\r\\nOf nature’s sale-work. ’Od’s my little life, \\r\\nI think she means to tangle my eyes too! \\r\\nNo, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it. \\r\\n’Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair, \\r\\nYour bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream, \\r\\nThat can entame my spirits to your worship. \\r\\nYou foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her, \\r\\nLike foggy south, puffing with wind and rain? \\r\\nYou are a thousand times a properer man \\r\\nThan she a woman. ’Tis such fools as you \\r\\nThat makes the world full of ill-favoured children. \\r\\n’Tis not her glass but you that flatters her, \\r\\nAnd out of you she sees herself more proper \\r\\nThan any of her lineaments can show her. \\r\\nBut, mistress, know yourself; down on your knees, \\r\\nAnd thank heaven, fasting, for a good man’s love. \\r\\nFor I must tell you friendly in your ear, \\r\\nSell when you can; you are not for all markets. \\r\\nCry the man mercy, love him, take his offer; \\r\\nFoul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer. \\r\\nSo take her to thee, shepherd. Fare you well.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nPHOEBE. \\r\\nSweet youth, I pray you chide a year together! \\r\\nI had rather hear you chide than this man woo.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nHe’s fall’n in love with your foulness, and she’ll fall in love with my anger.\\r\\nIf it be so, as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks, I’ll sauce her\\r\\nwith bitter words. Why look you so upon me?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nPHOEBE. \\r\\nFor no ill will I bear you.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nI pray you do not fall in love with me, \\r\\nFor I am falser than vows made in wine. \\r\\nBesides, I like you not. If you will know my house, \\r\\n’Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by. \\r\\nWill you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard. \\r\\nCome, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better, \\r\\nAnd be not proud. Though all the world could see, \\r\\nNone could be so abused in sight as he. \\r\\nCome, to our flock.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n[ Exeunt  Rosalind, Celia  and\\r\\n Corin . ]\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nPHOEBE. \\r\\nDead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might: \\r\\n“Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?”\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nSILVIUS. \\r\\nSweet Phoebe—\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nPHOEBE. \\r\\nHa, what sayst thou, Silvius?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nSILVIUS. \\r\\nSweet Phoebe, pity me.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nPHOEBE. \\r\\nWhy, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nSILVIUS. \\r\\nWherever sorrow is, relief would be. \\r\\nIf you do sorrow at my grief in love, \\r\\nBy giving love your sorrow and my grief \\r\\nWere both extermined.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nPHOEBE. \\r\\nThou hast my love. Is not that neighbourly?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nSILVIUS. \\r\\nI would have you.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nPHOEBE. \\r\\nWhy, that were covetousness. \\r\\nSilvius, the time was that I hated thee; \\r\\nAnd yet it is not that I bear thee love; \\r\\nBut since that thou canst talk of love so well, \\r\\nThy company, which erst was irksome to me, \\r\\nI will endure, and I’ll employ thee too. \\r\\nBut do not look for further recompense \\r\\nThan thine own gladness that thou art employed.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nSILVIUS. \\r\\nSo holy and so perfect is my love, \\r\\nAnd I in such a poverty of grace, \\r\\nThat I shall think it a most plenteous crop \\r\\nTo glean the broken ears after the man \\r\\nThat the main harvest reaps. Loose now and then \\r\\nA scattered smile, and that I’ll live upon.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nPHOEBE. \\r\\nKnow’st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nSILVIUS. \\r\\nNot very well, but I have met him oft, \\r\\nAnd he hath bought the cottage and the bounds \\r\\nThat the old carlot once was master of.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nPHOEBE. \\r\\nThink not I love him, though I ask for him. \\r\\n’Tis but a peevish boy—yet he talks well. \\r\\nBut what care I for words? Yet words do well \\r\\nWhen he that speaks them pleases those that hear. \\r\\nIt is a pretty youth—not very pretty— \\r\\nBut sure he’s proud, and yet his pride becomes him. \\r\\nHe’ll make a proper man. The best thing in him \\r\\nIs his complexion; and faster than his tongue \\r\\nDid make offence, his eye did heal it up. \\r\\nHe is not very tall, yet for his years he’s tall; \\r\\nHis leg is but so-so, and yet ’tis well. \\r\\nThere was a pretty redness in his lip, \\r\\nA little riper and more lusty red \\r\\nThan that mixed in his cheek. ’Twas just the difference \\r\\nBetwixt the constant red and mingled damask. \\r\\nThere be some women, Silvius, had they marked him \\r\\nIn parcels as I did, would have gone near \\r\\nTo fall in love with him; but for my part \\r\\nI love him not nor hate him not; and yet \\r\\nI have more cause to hate him than to love him. \\r\\nFor what had he to do to chide at me? \\r\\nHe said mine eyes were black and my hair black, \\r\\nAnd now I am remembered, scorned at me. \\r\\nI marvel why I answered not again. \\r\\nBut that’s all one: omittance is no quittance. \\r\\nI’ll write to him a very taunting letter, \\r\\nAnd thou shalt bear it. Wilt thou, Silvius?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nSILVIUS. \\r\\nPhoebe, with all my heart.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nPHOEBE. \\r\\nI’ll write it straight, \\r\\nThe matter’s in my head and in my heart. \\r\\nI will be bitter with him and passing short. \\r\\nGo with me, Silvius.\\r\\n \\r\\n [ Exeunt. ] \\r\\n  \\r\\n \\r\\n     ACT IV  \\r\\n   SCENE I. The Forest of Arden  \\r\\n \\r\\nEnter  Rosalind, Celia  and\\r\\n Jaques .\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nI prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with thee.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nThey say you are a melancholy fellow.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nI am so; I do love it better than laughing.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nThose that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows, and betray\\r\\nthemselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nWhy, ’tis good to be sad and say nothing.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nWhy then, ’tis good to be a post.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nI have neither the scholar’s melancholy, which is emulation; nor the\\r\\nmusician’s, which is fantastical; nor the courtier’s, which is proud; nor the\\r\\nsoldier’s, which is ambitious; nor the lawyer’s, which is politic; nor the\\r\\nlady’s, which is nice; nor the lover’s, which is all these; but it is a\\r\\nmelancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted from many\\r\\nobjects, and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels, in which my often\\r\\nrumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nA traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be sad. I fear you have sold\\r\\nyour own lands to see other men’s. Then to have seen much and to have nothing\\r\\nis to have rich eyes and poor hands.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nYes, I have gained my experience.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nAnd your experience makes you sad. I had rather have a fool to make me merry\\r\\nthan experience to make me sad—and to travel for it too.\\r\\n \\r\\n Enter  Orlando . \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nGood day and happiness, dear Rosalind!\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nNay, then, God be wi’ you, an you talk in blank verse.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nFarewell, Monsieur Traveller. Look you lisp and wear strange suits; disable all\\r\\nthe benefits of your own country; be out of love with your nativity, and almost\\r\\nchide God for making you that countenance you are, or I will scarce think you\\r\\nhave swam in a gondola.\\r\\n \\r\\n [ Exit  Jaques . ] \\r\\n \\r\\nWhy, how now, Orlando, where have you been all this while? You a lover! An you\\r\\nserve me such another trick, never come in my sight more.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nMy fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nBreak an hour’s promise in love? He that will divide a minute into a thousand\\r\\nparts, and break but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs of\\r\\nlove, it may be said of him that Cupid hath clapped him o’ the shoulder, but\\r\\nI’ll warrant him heart-whole.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nPardon me, dear Rosalind.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nNay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had as lief be wooed of a\\r\\nsnail.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nOf a snail?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nAy, of a snail, for though he comes slowly, he carries his house on his head—a\\r\\nbetter jointure, I think, than you make a woman. Besides, he brings his destiny\\r\\nwith him.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nWhat’s that?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nWhy, horns, which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for. But\\r\\nhe comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nVirtue is no horn-maker and my Rosalind is virtuous.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nAnd I am your Rosalind.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nIt pleases him to call you so, but he hath a Rosalind of a better leer than\\r\\nyou.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nCome, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday humour, and like enough to\\r\\nconsent. What would you say to me now, an I were your very, very Rosalind?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nI would kiss before I spoke.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nNay, you were better speak first, and when you were gravelled for lack of\\r\\nmatter, you might take occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are out,\\r\\nthey will spit; and for lovers lacking—God warn us—matter, the cleanliest\\r\\nshift is to kiss.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nHow if the kiss be denied?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nThen she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nWho could be out, being before his beloved mistress?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nMarry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or I should think my honesty\\r\\nranker than my wit.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nWhat, of my suit?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nNot out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit. Am not I your Rosalind?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nI take some joy to say you are because I would be talking of her.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nWell, in her person, I say I will not have you.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nThen, in mine own person, I die.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nNo, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six thousand years old,\\r\\nand in all this time there was not any man died in his own person,\\r\\n videlicet , in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains dashed out with a\\r\\nGrecian club, yet he did what he could to die before, and he is one of the\\r\\npatterns of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair year though Hero had\\r\\nturned nun, if it had not been for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he\\r\\nwent but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and, being taken with the cramp,\\r\\nwas drowned; and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was Hero of\\r\\nSestos. But these are all lies. Men have died from time to time and worms have\\r\\neaten them, but not for love.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nI would not have my right Rosalind of this mind, for I protest her frown\\r\\nmight kill me.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nBy this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I will be your Rosalind in\\r\\na more coming-on disposition, and ask me what you will, I will grant it.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nThen love me, Rosalind.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nYes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nAnd wilt thou have me?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nAy, and twenty such.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nWhat sayest thou?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nAre you not good?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nI hope so.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nWhy then, can one desire too much of a good thing?—Come, sister, you shall be\\r\\nthe priest and marry us.—Give me your hand, Orlando.—What do you say, sister?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nPray thee, marry us.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nI cannot say the words.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nYou must begin “Will you, Orlando—”\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nGo to.—Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nI will.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nAy, but when?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nWhy now, as fast as she can marry us.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nThen you must say “I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.”\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nI take thee, Rosalind, for wife.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nI might ask you for your commission. But I do take thee, Orlando, for my\\r\\nhusband. There’s a girl goes before the priest, and certainly a woman’s\\r\\nthought runs before her actions.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nSo do all thoughts. They are winged.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nNow tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nFor ever and a day.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nSay “a day” without the “ever.” No, no, Orlando, men are April when they woo,\\r\\nDecember when they wed. Maids are May when they are maids, but the sky changes\\r\\nwhen they are wives. I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon\\r\\nover his hen, more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more new-fangled than\\r\\nan ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey. I will weep for nothing, like\\r\\nDiana in the fountain, and I will do that when you are disposed to be merry. I\\r\\nwill laugh like a hyena, and that when thou are inclined to sleep.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nBut will my Rosalind do so?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nBy my life, she will do as I do.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nO, but she is wise.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nOr else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser, the waywarder. Make\\r\\nthe doors upon a woman’s wit, and it will out at the casement. Shut that, and\\r\\n’twill out at the keyhole. Stop that, ’twill fly with the smoke out at the\\r\\nchimney.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nA man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say, “Wit, whither wilt?”\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nNay, you might keep that check for it till you met your wife’s wit going to\\r\\nyour neighbour’s bed.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nAnd what wit could wit have to excuse that?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nMarry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never take her without her\\r\\nanswer unless you take her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot make\\r\\nher fault her husband’s occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for\\r\\nshe will breed it like a fool.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nFor these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nAlas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nI must attend the Duke at dinner. By two o’clock I will be with thee again.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nAy, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would prove. My friends told me\\r\\nas much, and I thought no less. That flattering tongue of yours won me. ’Tis\\r\\nbut one cast away, and so, come death! Two o’clock is your hour?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nAy, sweet Rosalind.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nBy my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and by all pretty oaths\\r\\nthat are not dangerous, if you break one jot of your promise or come one\\r\\nminute behind your hour, I will think you the most pathetical break-promise,\\r\\nand the most hollow lover, and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that\\r\\nmay be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful. Therefore beware my\\r\\ncensure, and keep your promise.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nWith no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind. So, adieu.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nWell, Time is the old justice that examines all such offenders, and let time\\r\\ntry. Adieu.\\r\\n \\r\\n [ Exit  Orlando . ] \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nYou have simply misused our sex in your love-prate! We must have your doublet\\r\\nand hose plucked over your head and show the world what the bird hath done to\\r\\nher own nest.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nO coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst know how many fathom\\r\\ndeep I am in love! But it cannot be sounded; my affection hath an unknown\\r\\nbottom, like the Bay of Portugal.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nOr rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour affection in, it runs out.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nNo, that same wicked bastard of Venus, that was begot of thought, conceived of\\r\\nspleen, and born of madness, that blind rascally boy that abuses everyone’s\\r\\neyes because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I am in love. I’ll\\r\\ntell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando. I’ll go find a\\r\\nshadow and sigh till he come.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nAnd I’ll sleep.\\r\\n \\r\\n [ Exeunt. ] \\r\\n     SCENE II.

Bear this, bear all! \\r\\nShe says I am not fair, that I lack manners; \\r\\nShe calls me proud, and that she could not love me, \\r\\nWere man as rare as phoenix. ’Od’s my will, \\r\\nHer love is not the hare that I do hunt. \\r\\nWhy writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well, \\r\\nThis is a letter of your own device.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nSILVIUS. \\r\\nNo, I protest, I know not the contents. \\r\\nPhoebe did write it.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nCome, come, you are a fool, \\r\\nAnd turned into the extremity of love. \\r\\nI saw her hand. She has a leathern hand, \\r\\nA freestone-coloured hand. I verily did think \\r\\nThat her old gloves were on, but ’twas her hands. \\r\\nShe has a huswife’s hand—but that’s no matter. \\r\\nI say she never did invent this letter; \\r\\nThis is a man’s invention, and his hand.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nSILVIUS. \\r\\nSure, it is hers.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nWhy, ’tis a boisterous and a cruel style, \\r\\nA style for challengers. Why, she defies me, \\r\\nLike Turk to Christian. Women’s gentle brain \\r\\nCould not drop forth such giant-rude invention, \\r\\nSuch Ethiop words, blacker in their effect \\r\\nThan in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nSILVIUS. \\r\\nSo please you, for I never heard it yet, \\r\\nYet heard too much of Phoebe’s cruelty.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nShe Phoebes me.

Not to be endured!\\r\\nWell, go your way to her, for I see love hath made thee a tame snake, and say\\r\\nthis to her: that if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will not, I\\r\\nwill never have her unless thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover, hence,\\r\\nand not a word, for here comes more company.\\r\\n \\r\\n [ Exit  Silvius . ] \\r\\n Enter  Oliver . \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nGood morrow, fair ones. Pray you, if you know, \\r\\nWhere in the purlieus of this forest stands \\r\\nA sheepcote fenced about with olive trees?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nWest of this place, down in the neighbour bottom; \\r\\nThe rank of osiers, by the murmuring stream, \\r\\nLeft on your right hand, brings you to the place. \\r\\nBut at this hour the house doth keep itself. \\r\\nThere’s none within.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nIf that an eye may profit by a tongue, \\r\\nThen should I know you by description, \\r\\nSuch garments, and such years. “The boy is fair, \\r\\nOf female favour, and bestows himself \\r\\nLike a ripe sister; the woman low, \\r\\nAnd browner than her brother.” Are not you \\r\\nThe owner of the house I did inquire for?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nIt is no boast, being asked, to say we are.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nOrlando doth commend him to you both, \\r\\nAnd to that youth he calls his Rosalind \\r\\nHe sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nI am. What must we understand by this?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nSome of my shame, if you will know of me \\r\\nWhat man I am, and how, and why, and where \\r\\nThis handkerchief was stained.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nI pray you tell it.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nWhen last the young Orlando parted from you, \\r\\nHe left a promise to return again \\r\\nWithin an hour, and pacing through the forest, \\r\\nChewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy, \\r\\nLo, what befell. He threw his eye aside, \\r\\nAnd mark what object did present itself. \\r\\nUnder an oak, whose boughs were mossed with age \\r\\nAnd high top bald with dry antiquity, \\r\\nA wretched ragged man, o’ergrown with hair, \\r\\nLay sleeping on his back; about his neck \\r\\nA green and gilded snake had wreathed itself, \\r\\nWho with her head, nimble in threats, approached \\r\\nThe opening of his mouth. But suddenly, \\r\\nSeeing Orlando, it unlinked itself \\r\\nAnd with indented glides did slip away \\r\\nInto a bush; under which bush’s shade \\r\\nA lioness, with udders all drawn dry, \\r\\nLay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch \\r\\nWhen that the sleeping man should stir. For ’tis \\r\\nThe royal disposition of that beast \\r\\nTo prey on nothing that doth seem as dead. \\r\\nThis seen, Orlando did approach the man \\r\\nAnd found it was his brother, his elder brother.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nO, I have heard him speak of that same brother, \\r\\nAnd he did render him the most unnatural \\r\\nThat lived amongst men.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nAnd well he might so do, \\r\\nFor well I know he was unnatural.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nBut, to Orlando: did he leave him there, \\r\\nFood to the sucked and hungry lioness?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nTwice did he turn his back and purposed so; \\r\\nBut kindness, nobler ever than revenge, \\r\\nAnd nature, stronger than his just occasion, \\r\\nMade him give battle to the lioness, \\r\\nWho quickly fell before him; in which hurtling \\r\\nFrom miserable slumber I awaked.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nAre you his brother?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nWas it you he rescued?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nWas’t you that did so oft contrive to kill him?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\n’Twas I; but ’tis not I. I do not shame \\r\\nTo tell you what I was, since my conversion \\r\\nSo sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nBut, for the bloody napkin?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nBy and by. \\r\\nWhen from the first to last betwixt us two \\r\\nTears our recountments had most kindly bathed— \\r\\nAs how I came into that desert place— \\r\\nIn brief, he led me to the gentle Duke, \\r\\nWho gave me fresh array and entertainment, \\r\\nCommitting me unto my brother’s love, \\r\\nWho led me instantly unto his cave, \\r\\nThere stripped himself, and here upon his arm \\r\\nThe lioness had torn some flesh away, \\r\\nWhich all this while had bled; and now he fainted, \\r\\nAnd cried in fainting upon Rosalind. \\r\\nBrief, I recovered him, bound up his wound, \\r\\nAnd after some small space, being strong at heart, \\r\\nHe sent me hither, stranger as I am, \\r\\nTo tell this story, that you might excuse \\r\\nHis broken promise, and to give this napkin, \\r\\nDyed in his blood, unto the shepherd youth \\r\\nThat he in sport doth call his Rosalind.\\r\\n \\r\\n [  Rosalind  faints. ] \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nWhy, how now, Ganymede, sweet Ganymede!\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nMany will swoon when they do look on blood.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nThere is more in it. Cousin—Ganymede!\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nLook, he recovers.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nI would I were at home.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nWe’ll lead you thither. \\r\\nI pray you, will you take him by the arm?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nBe of good cheer, youth. You a man? You lack a man’s heart.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nI do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would think this was well\\r\\ncounterfeited. I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nThis was not counterfeit. There is too great testimony in your complexion that\\r\\nit was a passion of earnest.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nCounterfeit, I assure you.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nWell then, take a good heart, and counterfeit to be a man.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nSo I do. But, i’ faith, I should have been a woman by right.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nCELIA. \\r\\nCome, you look paler and paler. Pray you draw homewards. Good sir, go with us.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOLIVER. \\r\\nThat will I, for I must bear answer back \\r\\nHow you excuse my brother, Rosalind.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\nI shall devise something.

I do now remember a saying: “The fool doth think he is\\r\\nwise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.” The heathen philosopher,\\r\\nwhen he had a desire to eat a grape, would open his lips when he put it into\\r\\nhis mouth, meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and lips to open.

They are in the very wrath of love, and they will together. Clubs\\r\\ncannot part them.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nThey shall be married tomorrow, and I will bid the Duke to the nuptial. But O,\\r\\nhow bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man’s eyes!

I speak\\r\\nnot this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomuch I say I\\r\\nknow you are. Neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in some little\\r\\nmeasure draw a belief from you, to do yourself good, and not to grace me.\\r\\nBelieve then, if you please, that I can do strange things. I have, since I was\\r\\nthree year old, conversed with a magician, most profound in his art and yet not\\r\\ndamnable.

And from hence I go \\r\\nTo make these doubts all even.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n[ Exeunt  Rosalind  and\\r\\n Celia . ]\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE SENIOR. \\r\\nI do remember in this shepherd boy \\r\\nSome lively touches of my daughter’s favour.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nMy lord, the first time that I ever saw him \\r\\nMethought he was a brother to your daughter. \\r\\nBut, my good lord, this boy is forest-born \\r\\nAnd hath been tutored in the rudiments \\r\\nOf many desperate studies by his uncle, \\r\\nWhom he reports to be a great magician, \\r\\nObscured in the circle of this forest.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nEnter  Touchstone  and\\r\\n Audrey .\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nThere is sure another flood toward, and these couples are coming to the ark.\\r\\nHere comes a pair of very strange beasts, which in all tongues are called fools.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nSalutation and greeting to you all.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nGood my lord, bid him welcome. This is the motley-minded gentleman that I have\\r\\nso often met in the forest. He hath been a courtier, he swears.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nIf any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation. I have trod a measure; I\\r\\nhave flattered a lady; I have been politic with my friend, smooth with mine\\r\\nenemy; I have undone three tailors; I have had four quarrels, and like to have\\r\\nfought one.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nAnd how was that ta’en up?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nFaith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nHow seventh cause?—Good my lord, like this fellow?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE SENIOR. \\r\\nI like him very well.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nGod ’ild you, sir, I desire you of the like. I press in here, sir, amongst the\\r\\nrest of the country copulatives, to swear and to forswear according as\\r\\nmarriage binds and blood breaks. A poor virgin, sir, an ill-favoured thing,\\r\\nsir, but mine own; a poor humour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else\\r\\nwill. Rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house, as your pearl in\\r\\nyour foul oyster.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE SENIOR. \\r\\nBy my faith, he is very swift and sententious.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nAccording to the fool’s bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nBut, for the seventh cause. How did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nUpon a lie seven times removed—bear your body more seeming, Audrey—as thus,\\r\\nsir. I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier’s beard. He sent me word if I\\r\\nsaid his beard was not cut well, he was in the mind it was. This is called the\\r\\n“retort courteous”. If I sent him word again it was not well cut, he would send\\r\\nme word he cut it to please himself. This is called the “quip modest”. If again\\r\\nit was not well cut, he disabled my judgement. This is called the “reply\\r\\nchurlish”. If again it was not well cut, he would answer I spake not true. This\\r\\nis called the “reproof valiant”. If again it was not well cut, he would say I\\r\\nlie. This is called the “countercheck quarrelsome”, and so, to the “lie\\r\\ncircumstantial”, and the “lie direct”.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nAnd how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nI durst go no further than the lie circumstantial, nor he durst not give me the\\r\\nlie direct; and so we measured swords and parted.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nCan you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTOUCHSTONE. \\r\\nO sir, we quarrel in print, by the book, as you have books for good manners. I\\r\\nwill name you the degrees: the first, the retort courteous; the second, the\\r\\nquip modest; the third, the reply churlish; the fourth, the reproof valiant;\\r\\nthe fifth, the countercheck quarrelsome; the sixth, the lie with circumstance;\\r\\nthe seventh, the lie direct. All these you may avoid but the lie direct and\\r\\nyou may avoid that too with an “if”. I knew when seven justices could not take\\r\\nup a quarrel, but when the parties were met themselves, one of them thought but\\r\\nof an “if”, as, “if you said so, then I said so;” and they shook hands, and\\r\\nswore brothers. Your “if” is the only peacemaker; much virtue in “if.”\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nIs not this a rare fellow, my lord? He’s as good at anything, and yet a fool.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE SENIOR. \\r\\nHe uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the presentation of that he\\r\\nshoots his wit.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nEnter  Hymen, Rosalind  in woman’s clothes, and\\r\\n Celia . Still music.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nHYMEN. \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Then is there mirth in heaven \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0When earthly things made even \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Atone together. \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Good Duke, receive thy daughter. \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Hymen from heaven brought her, \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Yea, brought her hither, \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0That thou mightst join her hand with his, \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Whose heart within his bosom is.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\n[ To Duke Senior .] To you I give myself, for I am yours. \\r\\n[ To Orlando .] To you I give myself, for I am yours.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE SENIOR. \\r\\nIf there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nORLANDO. \\r\\nIf there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nPHOEBE. \\r\\nIf sight and shape be true, \\r\\nWhy then, my love adieu.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nROSALIND. \\r\\n[ To Duke Senior .] I’ll have no father, if you be not he. \\r\\n[ To Orlando .] I’ll have no husband, if you be not he. \\r\\n[ To Phoebe .] Nor ne’er wed woman, if you be not she.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nHYMEN. \\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Peace, ho!

This to be true \\r\\nI do engage my life.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE SENIOR. \\r\\nWelcome, young man. \\r\\nThou offer’st fairly to thy brother’s wedding: \\r\\nTo one his lands withheld, and to the other \\r\\nA land itself at large, a potent dukedom. \\r\\nFirst, in this forest let us do those ends \\r\\nThat here were well begun and well begot; \\r\\nAnd after, every of this happy number \\r\\nThat have endured shrewd days and nights with us \\r\\nShall share the good of our returned fortune, \\r\\nAccording to the measure of their states. \\r\\nMeantime, forget this new-fall’n dignity, \\r\\nAnd fall into our rustic revelry. \\r\\nPlay, music! And you brides and bridegrooms all, \\r\\nWith measure heaped in joy to th’ measures fall.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nSir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly, \\r\\nThe Duke hath put on a religious life \\r\\nAnd thrown into neglect the pompous court.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES DE BOYS. \\r\\nHe hath.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nTo him will I. Out of these convertites \\r\\nThere is much matter to be heard and learned. \\r\\n[ To Duke Senior .] You to your former honour I bequeath; \\r\\nYour patience and your virtue well deserves it. \\r\\n[ To Orlando .] You to a love that your true faith doth merit. \\r\\n[ To Oliver .] You to your land, and love, and great allies. \\r\\n[ To Silvius .] You to a long and well-deserved bed. \\r\\n[ To Touchstone .] And you to wrangling, for thy loving voyage \\r\\nIs but for two months victualled.—So to your pleasures, \\r\\nI am for other than for dancing measures.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE SENIOR. \\r\\nStay, Jaques, stay.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nJAQUES. \\r\\nTo see no pastime, I. What you would have \\r\\nI’ll stay to know at your abandoned cave.\\r\\n \\r\\n [ Exit. ] \\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE SENIOR. \\r\\nProceed, proceed!

If it be true that good wine\\r\\nneeds no bush, ’tis true that a good play needs no epilogue. Yet to good wine\\r\\nthey do use good bushes, and good plays prove the better by the help of good\\r\\nepilogues. What a case am I in then, that am neither a good epilogue nor\\r\\ncannot insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play! I am not furnished like\\r\\na beggar; therefore to beg will not become me. My way is to conjure you, and\\r\\nI’ll begin with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love you bear to men,\\r\\nto like as much of this play as please you. And I charge you, O men, for the\\r\\nlove you bear to women—as I perceive by your simpering, none of you hates\\r\\nthem—that between you and the women the play may please. If I were a woman, I\\r\\nwould kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased me, complexions that liked\\r\\nme, and breaths that I defied not. And I am sure as many as have good beards,\\r\\nor good faces, or sweet breaths will for my kind offer, when I make curtsy,\\r\\nbid me farewell.\\r\\n \\r\\n [ Exit. ] \\r\\n  \\r\\n \\r\\n <a '"

The scene lies first near Oliver’s house; afterwards partly in the  Usurper’s court and partly in the Forest of Arden.                ACT I       SCENE I. An Orchard near Oliver’s house       Enter  Orlando  and   Adam .        ORLANDO.   As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a  thousand crowns, and, as thou sayst, charged my brother, on his blessing, to  breed me well; and there begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at  school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me  rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at home unkept;  for call you that keeping, for a gentleman of my birth, that differs not from  the stalling of an ox? His horses are bred better, for, besides that they are  fair with their feeding, they are taught their manage and to that end riders  dearly hired; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth, for the  which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I. Besides this  nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave me his  countenance seems to take from me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the  place of a brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my  education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me, and the spirit of my father,  which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against this servitude. I will no  longer endure it, though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid it.      Enter  Oliver .      ADAM.   Yonder comes my master, your brother.        ORLANDO.   Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up.      [  Adam  retires. ]      OLIVER.   Now, sir, what make you here?        ORLANDO.   Nothing. I am not taught to make anything.        OLIVER.   What mar you then, sir?        ORLANDO.   Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God made, a poor unworthy  brother of yours, with idleness.        OLIVER.   Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.        ORLANDO.   Shall I keep your hogs, and eat husks with them? What prodigal portion have I  spent that I should come to such penury?        OLIVER.   Know you where you are, sir?        ORLANDO.   O, sir, very well: here in your orchard.        OLIVER.   Know you before whom, sir?        ORLANDO.   Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know you are my eldest brother, and  in the gentle condition of blood you should so know me. The courtesy of  nations allows you my better in that you are the first-born, but the same  tradition takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt us. I  have as much of my father in me as you, albeit I confess your coming before  me is nearer to his reverence.        OLIVER.   What, boy!        ORLANDO.   Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.        OLIVER.   Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?        ORLANDO.   I am no villain. I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys; he was my  father, and he is thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains. Wert  thou not my brother, I would not take this hand from thy throat till this other  had pulled out thy tongue for saying so. Thou has railed on thyself.        ADAM.   [ Coming forward .] Sweet masters, be patient. For your father’s  remembrance, be at accord.        OLIVER.   Let me go, I say.        ORLANDO.   I will not till I please. You shall hear me. My father charged you in his will  to give me good education. You have trained me like a peasant, obscuring and  hiding from me all gentleman-like qualities. The spirit of my father grows  strong in me, and I will no longer endure it. Therefore allow me such  exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor allottery my father  left me by testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.        OLIVER.   And what wilt thou do? Beg when that is spent? Well, sir, get you in. I will  not long be troubled with you. You shall have some part of your will. I pray  you leave me.        ORLANDO.   I no further offend you than becomes me for my good.        OLIVER.   Get you with him, you old dog.        ADAM.   Is “old dog” my reward? Most true, I have lost my teeth in your service. God be  with my old master. He would not have spoke such a word.        [ Exeunt  Orlando  and   Adam . ]        OLIVER.   Is it even so? Begin you to grow upon me? I will physic your rankness, and yet  give no thousand crowns neither. Holla, Dennis!      Enter  Dennis .      DENNIS   Calls your worship?        OLIVER.   Was not Charles, the Duke’s wrestler, here to speak with me?        DENNIS   So please you, he is here at the door and importunes access to you.        OLIVER.   Call him in.      [ Exit  Dennis . ]      ’Twill be a good way, and tomorrow the wrestling is.      Enter  Charles .      CHARLES.   Good morrow to your worship.        OLIVER.   Good Monsieur Charles. What’s the new news at the new court?        CHARLES.   There’s no news at the court, sir, but the old news. That is, the old Duke is  banished by his younger brother the new Duke, and three or four loving lords  have put themselves into voluntary exile with him, whose lands and revenues  enrich the new Duke; therefore he gives them good leave to wander.        OLIVER.   Can you tell if Rosalind, the Duke’s daughter, be banished with her father?        CHARLES.   O, no; for the Duke’s daughter, her cousin, so loves her, being ever from their  cradles bred together, that she would have followed her exile or have died to  stay behind her. She is at the court and no less beloved of her uncle than his  own daughter, and never two ladies loved as they do.        OLIVER.   Where will the old Duke live?        CHARLES.   They say he is already in the Forest of Arden, and a many merry men with him;  and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England. They say many young  gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time carelessly, as they did in  the golden world.        OLIVER.   What, you wrestle tomorrow before the new Duke?        CHARLES.   Marry, do I, sir, and I came to acquaint you with a matter. I am given, sir,  secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition  to come in disguised against me to try a fall. Tomorrow, sir, I wrestle for my  credit, and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well.  Your brother is but young and tender, and for your love I would be loath to  foil him, as I must for my own honour if he come in. Therefore, out of my  love to you, I came hither to acquaint you withal, that either you might stay  him from his intendment, or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in  that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will.        OLIVER.   Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt find I will most  kindly requite. I had myself notice of my brother’s purpose herein, and have by  underhand means laboured to dissuade him from it; but he is resolute. I’ll tell  thee, Charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full of ambition,  an envious emulator of every man’s good parts, a secret and villainous  contriver against me his natural brother. Therefore use thy discretion. I had  as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger. And thou wert best look to’t;  for if thou dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace  himself on thee, he will practise against thee by poison, entrap thee by some  treacherous device, and never leave thee till he hath ta’en thy life by some  indirect means or other. For I assure thee (and almost with tears I speak it)  there is not one so young and so villainous this day living. I speak but  brotherly of him, but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush and  weep, and thou must look pale and wonder.        CHARLES.   I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come tomorrow I’ll give him his  payment. If ever he go alone again I’ll never wrestle for prize more. And so,  God keep your worship.      [ Exit. ]      OLIVER.   Farewell, good Charles. Now will I stir this gamester. I hope I shall see an  end of him; for my soul—yet I know not why—hates nothing more than he. Yet  he’s gentle, never schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of all sorts  enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much in the heart of the world, and  especially of my own people, who best know him, that I am altogether misprized.  But it shall not be so long; this wrestler shall clear all. Nothing remains but  that I kindle the boy thither, which now I’ll go about.      [ Exit. ]        SCENE II. A Lawn before the Duke’s Palace       Enter  Rosalind  and   Celia .        CELIA.   I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.        ROSALIND.   Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of, and would you yet I were  merrier? Unless you could teach me to forget a banished father, you must not  learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.        CELIA.   Herein I see thou lov’st me not with the full weight that I love thee. If my  uncle, thy banished father, had banished thy uncle, the Duke my father, so thou  hadst been still with me, I could have taught my love to take thy father for  mine. So wouldst thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously  tempered as mine is to thee.        ROSALIND.   Well, I will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours.        CELIA.   You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is like to have; and truly,  when he dies thou shalt be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy  father perforce, I will render thee again in affection. By mine honour I will!  And when I break that oath, let me turn monster. Therefore, my sweet Rose, my  dear Rose, be merry.        ROSALIND.   From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let me see—what think you of  falling in love?        CELIA.   Marry, I prithee do, to make sport withal; but love no man in good earnest,  nor no further in sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in  honour come off again.        ROSALIND.   What shall be our sport, then?        CELIA.   Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her wheel, that her gifts  may henceforth be bestowed equally.        ROSALIND.   I would we could do so, for her benefits are mightily misplaced, and the  bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women.        CELIA.   ’Tis true, for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest, and those  that she makes honest she makes very ill-favouredly.        ROSALIND.   Nay, now thou goest from Fortune’s office to Nature’s. Fortune reigns in gifts  of the world, not in the lineaments of Nature.      Enter  Touchstone .      CELIA.   No? When Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by Fortune fall into the  fire? Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune  sent in this fool to cut off the argument?        ROSALIND.   Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when Fortune makes Nature’s  natural the cutter-off of Nature’s wit.        CELIA.   Peradventure this is not Fortune’s work neither, but Nature’s, who perceiveth  our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses, and hath sent this  natural for our whetstone; for always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone  of the wits.—How now, wit, whither wander you?        TOUCHSTONE.   Mistress, you must come away to your father.        CELIA.   Were you made the messenger?        TOUCHSTONE.   No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.        ROSALIND.   Where learned you that oath, fool?        TOUCHSTONE.   Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were good pancakes, and swore  by his honour the mustard was naught. Now, I’ll stand to it, the pancakes were  naught and the mustard was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.        CELIA.   How prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge?        ROSALIND.   Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.        TOUCHSTONE.   Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and swear by your beards that I am  a knave.        CELIA.   By our beards, if we had them, thou art.        TOUCHSTONE.   By my knavery, if I had it, then I were. But if you swear by that that is not,  you are not forsworn. No more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he  never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those  pancackes or that mustard.        CELIA.   Prithee, who is’t that thou mean’st?        TOUCHSTONE.   One that old Frederick, your father, loves.        CELIA.   My father’s love is enough to honour him. Enough! Speak no more of him. You’ll  be whipped for taxation one of these days.        TOUCHSTONE.   The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly.        CELIA.   By my troth, thou sayest true. For since the little wit that fools have was  silenced, the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes  Monsieur Le Beau.      Enter  Le Beau .      ROSALIND.   With his mouth full of news.        CELIA.   Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young.        ROSALIND.   Then shall we be news-crammed.        CELIA.   All the better; we shall be the more marketable.    Bonjour , Monsieur Le Beau. What’s the news?        LE BEAU.   Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.        CELIA.   Sport! Of what colour?        LE BEAU.   What colour, madam? How shall I answer you?        ROSALIND.   As wit and fortune will.        TOUCHSTONE.   Or as the destinies decrees.        CELIA.   Well said. That was laid on with a trowel.        TOUCHSTONE.   Nay, if I keep not my rank—        ROSALIND.   Thou losest thy old smell.        LE BEAU.   You amaze me, ladies. I would have told you of good wrestling, which you have  lost the sight of.        ROSALIND.   Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.        LE BEAU.   I will tell you the beginning and, if it please your ladyships, you may see  the end, for the best is yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming to  perform it.        CELIA.   Well, the beginning that is dead and buried.        LE BEAU.   There comes an old man and his three sons—        CELIA.   I could match this beginning with an old tale.        LE BEAU.   Three proper young men of excellent growth and presence.        ROSALIND.   With bills on their necks: “Be it known unto all men by these presents.”        LE BEAU.   The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the Duke’s wrestler, which  Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs, that there is  little hope of life in him. So he served the second, and so the third. Yonder  they lie, the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them  that all the beholders take his part with weeping.        ROSALIND.   Alas!        TOUCHSTONE.   But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have lost?        LE BEAU.   Why, this that I speak of.        TOUCHSTONE.   Thus men may grow wiser every day. It is the first time that ever I heard  breaking of ribs was sport for ladies.        CELIA.   Or I, I promise thee.        ROSALIND.   But is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides? Is there yet  another dotes upon rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?        LE BEAU.   You must if you stay here, for here is the place appointed for the wrestling,  and they are ready to perform it.        CELIA.   Yonder, sure, they are coming. Let us now stay and see it.      Flourish. Enter  Duke Frederick,  Lords, Orlando, Charles  and Attendants.      DUKE FREDERICK.   Come on. Since the youth will not be entreated, his own peril on his  forwardness.        ROSALIND.   Is yonder the man?        LE BEAU.   Even he, madam.        CELIA.   Alas, he is too young. Yet he looks successfully.        DUKE FREDERICK.   How now, daughter and cousin? Are you crept hither to see the wrestling?        ROSALIND.   Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.        DUKE FREDERICK.   You will take little delight in it, I can tell you, there is such odds in the  man. In pity of the challenger’s youth I would fain dissuade him, but he will  not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if you can move him.        CELIA.   Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.        DUKE FREDERICK.   Do so; I’ll not be by.      [  Duke Frederick  steps  aside. ]      LE BEAU.   Monsieur the challenger, the Princess calls for you.        ORLANDO.   I attend them with all respect and duty.        ROSALIND.   Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?        ORLANDO.   No, fair princess. He is the general challenger. I come but in as others do,  to try with him the strength of my youth.        CELIA.   Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years. You have seen cruel  proof of this man’s strength. If you saw yourself with your eyes or knew  yourself with your judgement, the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a  more equal enterprise. We pray you for your own sake to embrace your own  safety and give over this attempt.        ROSALIND.   Do, young sir. Your reputation shall not therefore be misprized. We will make  it our suit to the Duke that the wrestling might not go forward.        ORLANDO.   I beseech you, punish me not with your hard thoughts, wherein I confess me much  guilty to deny so fair and excellent ladies anything. But let your fair eyes  and gentle wishes go with me to my trial, wherein if I be foiled there is but  one shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one dead that is willing to  be so. I shall do my friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me; the world  no injury, for in it I have nothing. Only in the world I fill up a place, which  may be better supplied when I have made it empty.        ROSALIND.   The little strength that I have, I would it were with you.        CELIA.   And mine to eke out hers.        ROSALIND.   Fare you well. Pray heaven I be deceived in you.        CELIA.   Your heart’s desires be with you.        CHARLES.   Come, where is this young gallant that is so desirous to lie with his mother  earth?        ORLANDO.   Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.        DUKE FREDERICK.   You shall try but one fall.        CHARLES.   No, I warrant your grace you shall not entreat him to a second, that have so  mightily persuaded him from a first.        ORLANDO.   You mean to mock me after; you should not have mocked me before. But come your  ways.        ROSALIND.   Now, Hercules be thy speed, young man!        CELIA.   I would I were invisible, to catch the strong fellow by the leg.        [  Orlando  and   Charles  wrestle. ]        ROSALIND.   O excellent young man!        CELIA.   If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who should down.      [  Charles  is thrown. Shout. ]      DUKE FREDERICK.   No more, no more.        ORLANDO.   Yes, I beseech your grace. I am not yet well breathed.        DUKE FREDERICK.   How dost thou, Charles?        LE BEAU.   He cannot speak, my lord.        DUKE FREDERICK.   Bear him away.      [  Charles  is carried off by Attendants. ]      What is thy name, young man?        ORLANDO.   Orlando, my liege, the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.        DUKE FREDERICK.   I would thou hadst been son to some man else.   The world esteemed thy father honourable,   But I did find him still mine enemy.   Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed   Hadst thou descended from another house.   But fare thee well, thou art a gallant youth.   I would thou hadst told me of another father.        [ Exeunt  Duke Frederick, Le Beau  and  Lords. ]        CELIA.   Were I my father, coz, would I do this?        ORLANDO.   I am more proud to be Sir Rowland’s son,   His youngest son, and would not change that calling   To be adopted heir to Frederick.        ROSALIND.   My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,   And all the world was of my father’s mind.   Had I before known this young man his son,   I should have given him tears unto entreaties   Ere he should thus have ventured.        CELIA.   Gentle cousin,   Let us go thank him and encourage him.   My father’s rough and envious disposition   Sticks me at heart.—Sir, you have well deserved.   If you do keep your promises in love   But justly, as you have exceeded promise,   Your mistress shall be happy.        ROSALIND.   Gentleman,      [ Giving him a chain from her neck .]      Wear this for me—one out of suits with Fortune,   That could give more but that her hand lacks means.—   Shall we go, coz?        CELIA.   Ay.—Fare you well, fair gentleman.        ORLANDO.   Can I not say, I thank you? My better parts   Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up   Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.        ROSALIND.   He calls us back. My pride fell with my fortunes.   I’ll ask him what he would.—Did you call, sir?—   Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown   More than your enemies.        CELIA.   Will you go, coz?        ROSALIND.   Have with you.—Fare you well.        [ Exeunt  Rosalind  and   Celia . ]        ORLANDO.   What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?   I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.   O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown.   Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.      Enter  Le Beau .      LE BEAU.   Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you   To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved   High commendation, true applause, and love,   Yet such is now the Duke’s condition   That he misconsters all that you have done.   The Duke is humorous; what he is indeed   More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.        ORLANDO.   I thank you, sir; and pray you tell me this:   Which of the two was daughter of the Duke   That here was at the wrestling?        LE BEAU.   Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners,   But yet indeed the smaller is his daughter.   The other is daughter to the banished Duke,   And here detained by her usurping uncle   To keep his daughter company, whose loves   Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.   But I can tell you that of late this Duke   Hath ta’en displeasure ’gainst his gentle niece,   Grounded upon no other argument   But that the people praise her for her virtues   And pity her for her good father’s sake;   And, on my life, his malice ’gainst the lady   Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well.   Hereafter, in a better world than this,   I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.        ORLANDO.   I rest much bounden to you; fare you well!      [ Exit  Le Beau . ]      Thus must I from the smoke into the smother,   From tyrant Duke unto a tyrant brother.   But heavenly Rosalind!      [ Exit. ]        SCENE III. A Room in the Palace       Enter  Celia  and   Rosalind .        CELIA.   Why, cousin, why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! Not a word?        ROSALIND.   Not one to throw at a dog.        CELIA.   No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs. Throw some of them at  me. Come, lame me with reasons.        ROSALIND.   Then there were two cousins laid up, when the one should be lamed with reasons  and the other mad without any.        CELIA.   But is all this for your father?        ROSALIND.   No, some of it is for my child’s father. O, how full of briers is this  working-day world!        CELIA.   They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in holiday foolery. If we walk not  in the trodden paths, our very petticoats will catch them.        ROSALIND.   I could shake them off my coat; these burs are in my heart.        CELIA.   Hem them away.        ROSALIND.   I would try, if I could cry “hem” and have him.        CELIA.   Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.        ROSALIND.   O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself.        CELIA.   O, a good wish upon you! You will try in time, in despite of a fall. But  turning these jests out of service, let us talk in good earnest. Is it  possible on such a sudden you should fall into so strong a liking with old  Sir Rowland’s youngest son?        ROSALIND.   The Duke my father loved his father dearly.        CELIA.   Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly? By this kind of  chase I should hate him, for my father hated his father dearly; yet I hate not  Orlando.        ROSALIND.   No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.        CELIA.   Why should I not? Doth he not deserve well?      Enter  Duke Frederick  with Lords.      ROSALIND.   Let me love him for that, and do you love him because I do.—Look, here comes  the Duke.        CELIA.   With his eyes full of anger.        DUKE FREDERICK.   Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste,   And get you from our court.        ROSALIND.   Me, uncle?        DUKE FREDERICK.   You, cousin.   Within these ten days if that thou be’st found   So near our public court as twenty miles,   Thou diest for it.        ROSALIND.   I do beseech your Grace,   Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me.   If with myself I hold intelligence,   Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,   If that I do not dream, or be not frantic—   As I do trust I am not—then, dear uncle,   Never so much as in a thought unborn   Did I offend your Highness.        DUKE FREDERICK.   Thus do all traitors.   If their purgation did consist in words,   They are as innocent as grace itself.   Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.        ROSALIND.   Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor.   Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.        DUKE FREDERICK.   Thou art thy father’s daughter, there’s enough.        ROSALIND.   So was I when your highness took his dukedom;   So was I when your highness banished him.   Treason is not inherited, my lord,   Or, if we did derive it from our friends,   What’s that to me? My father was no traitor.   Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much   To think my poverty is treacherous.        CELIA.   Dear sovereign, hear me speak.        DUKE FREDERICK.   Ay, Celia, we stayed her for your sake,   Else had she with her father ranged along.        CELIA.   I did not then entreat to have her stay;   It was your pleasure and your own remorse.   I was too young that time to value her,   But now I know her. If she be a traitor,   Why, so am I. We still have slept together,   Rose at an instant, learned, played, ate together,   And wheresoe’er we went, like Juno’s swans,   Still we went coupled and inseparable.        DUKE FREDERICK.   She is too subtle for thee, and her smoothness,   Her very silence, and her patience   Speak to the people, and they pity her.   Thou art a fool. She robs thee of thy name,   And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous   When she is gone. Then open not thy lips.   Firm and irrevocable is my doom   Which I have passed upon her. She is banished.        CELIA.   Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege.   I cannot live out of her company.        DUKE FREDERICK.   You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself.   If you outstay the time, upon mine honour   And in the greatness of my word, you die.      [ Exeunt  Duke Frederick   and Lords. ]      CELIA.   O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?   Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.   I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.        ROSALIND.   I have more cause.        CELIA.   Thou hast not, cousin.   Prithee be cheerful. Know’st thou not the Duke   Hath banished me, his daughter?        ROSALIND.   That he hath not.        CELIA.   No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love   Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one.   Shall we be sundered? Shall we part, sweet girl?   No, let my father seek another heir.   Therefore devise with me how we may fly,   Whither to go, and what to bear with us,   And do not seek to take your change upon you,   To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out.   For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,   Say what thou canst, I’ll go along with thee.        ROSALIND.   Why, whither shall we go?        CELIA.   To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.        ROSALIND.   Alas, what danger will it be to us,   Maids as we are, to travel forth so far?   Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.        CELIA.   I’ll put myself in poor and mean attire,   And with a kind of umber smirch my face.   The like do you; so shall we pass along   And never stir assailants.        ROSALIND.   Were it not better,   Because that I am more than common tall,   That I did suit me all points like a man?   A gallant curtal-axe upon my thigh,   A boar-spear in my hand, and in my heart   Lie there what hidden woman’s fear there will,   We’ll have a swashing and a martial outside,   As many other mannish cowards have   That do outface it with their semblances.        CELIA.   What shall I call thee when thou art a man?        ROSALIND.   I’ll have no worse a name than Jove’s own page,   And therefore look you call me Ganymede.   But what will you be called?        CELIA.   Something that hath a reference to my state:   No longer Celia, but Aliena.        ROSALIND.   But, cousin, what if we assayed to steal   The clownish fool out of your father’s court?   Would he not be a comfort to our travel?        CELIA.   He’ll go along o’er the wide world with me.   Leave me alone to woo him. Let’s away,   And get our jewels and our wealth together,   Devise the fittest time and safest way   To hide us from pursuit that will be made   After my flight. Now go we in content   To liberty, and not to banishment.      [ Exeunt. ]               ACT II       SCENE I. The Forest of Arden     Enter  Duke Senior, Amiens   and two or three Lords, dressed as foresters.      DUKE SENIOR.   Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,   Hath not old custom made this life more sweet   Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods   More free from peril than the envious court?   Here feel we not the penalty of Adam,   The seasons’ difference, as the icy fang   And churlish chiding of the winter’s wind,   Which when it bites and blows upon my body   Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say:   “This is no flattery. These are counsellors   That feelingly persuade me what I am.”   Sweet are the uses of adversity,   Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,   Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;   And this our life, exempt from public haunt,   Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,   Sermons in stones, and good in everything.        AMIENS.   I would not change it. Happy is your grace,   That can translate the stubbornness of fortune   Into so quiet and so sweet a style.        DUKE SENIOR.   Come, shall we go and kill us venison?   And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,   Being native burghers of this desert city,   Should in their own confines with forked heads   Have their round haunches gored.        FIRST LORD.   Indeed, my lord,   The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,   And in that kind swears you do more usurp   Than doth your brother that hath banished you.   Today my lord of Amiens and myself   Did steal behind him as he lay along   Under an oak, whose antique root peeps out   Upon the brook that brawls along this wood;   To the which place a poor sequestered stag,   That from the hunter’s aim had ta’en a hurt,   Did come to languish; and indeed, my lord,   The wretched animal heaved forth such groans   That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat   Almost to bursting, and the big round tears   Coursed one another down his innocent nose   In piteous chase. And thus the hairy fool,   Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,   Stood on th’ extremest verge of the swift brook,   Augmenting it with tears.        DUKE SENIOR.   But what said Jaques?   Did he not moralize this spectacle?        FIRST LORD.   O yes, into a thousand similes.   First, for his weeping into the needless stream:   “Poor deer,” quoth he “thou mak’st a testament   As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more   To that which had too much.” Then, being there alone,   Left and abandoned of his velvet friends:   “’Tis right”; quoth he, “thus misery doth part   The flux of company.” Anon a careless herd,   Full of the pasture, jumps along by him   And never stays to greet him. “Ay,” quoth Jaques,   “Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens!   ’Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you look   Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?”   Thus most invectively he pierceth through   The body of the country, city, court,   Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we   Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what’s worse,   To fright the animals and to kill them up   In their assigned and native dwelling-place.        DUKE SENIOR.   And did you leave him in this contemplation?        SECOND LORD.   We did, my lord, weeping and commenting   Upon the sobbing deer.        DUKE SENIOR.   Show me the place.   I love to cope him in these sullen fits,   For then he’s full of matter.        FIRST LORD.   I’ll bring you to him straight.      [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE II. A Room in the Palace     Enter  Duke Frederick  with  Lords.      DUKE FREDERICK.   Can it be possible that no man saw them?   It cannot be! Some villains of my court   Are of consent and sufferance in this.        FIRST LORD.   I cannot hear of any that did see her.   The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,   Saw her abed, and in the morning early   They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.        SECOND LORD.   My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft   Your grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.   Hesperia, the princess’ gentlewoman,   Confesses that she secretly o’erheard   Your daughter and her cousin much commend   The parts and graces of the wrestler   That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;   And she believes wherever they are gone   That youth is surely in their company.        DUKE FREDERICK.   Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither.   If he be absent, bring his brother to me.   I’ll make him find him. Do this suddenly!   And let not search and inquisition quail   To bring again these foolish runaways.      [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE III. Before Oliver’s House       Enter  Orlando  and   Adam , meeting.        ORLANDO.   Who’s there?        ADAM.   What, my young master? O my gentle master,   O my sweet master, O you memory   Of old Sir Rowland! Why, what make you here?   Why are you virtuous? Why do people love you?   And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant?   Why would you be so fond to overcome   The bonny prizer of the humorous Duke?   Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.   Know you not, master, to some kind of men   Their graces serve them but as enemies?   No more do yours. Your virtues, gentle master,   Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.   O, what a world is this, when what is comely   Envenoms him that bears it!        ORLANDO.   Why, what’s the matter?        ADAM.   O unhappy youth,   Come not within these doors! Within this roof   The enemy of all your graces lives.   Your brother—no, no brother, yet the son—   Yet not the son; I will not call him son—   Of him I was about to call his father,   Hath heard your praises, and this night he means   To burn the lodging where you use to lie,   And you within it. If he fail of that,   He will have other means to cut you off;   I overheard him and his practices.   This is no place; this house is but a butchery.   Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.        ORLANDO.   Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?        ADAM.   No matter whither, so you come not here.        ORLANDO.   What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food,   Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce   A thievish living on the common road?   This I must do, or know not what to do.   Yet this I will not do, do how I can.   I rather will subject me to the malice   Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.        ADAM.   But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,   The thrifty hire I saved under your father,   Which I did store to be my foster-nurse,   When service should in my old limbs lie lame,   And unregarded age in corners thrown.   Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,   Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,   Be comfort to my age. Here is the gold.   All this I give you. Let me be your servant.   Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty,   For in my youth I never did apply   Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,   Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo   The means of weakness and debility.   Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,   Frosty but kindly. Let me go with you.   I’ll do the service of a younger man   In all your business and necessities.        ORLANDO.   O good old man, how well in thee appears   The constant service of the antique world,   When service sweat for duty, not for meed.   Thou art not for the fashion of these times,   Where none will sweat but for promotion,   And having that do choke their service up   Even with the having. It is not so with thee.   But, poor old man, thou prun’st a rotten tree,   That cannot so much as a blossom yield   In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry.   But come thy ways, we’ll go along together,   And ere we have thy youthful wages spent   We’ll light upon some settled low content.        ADAM.   Master, go on and I will follow thee   To the last gasp with truth and loyalty.   From seventeen years till now almost fourscore   Here lived I, but now live here no more.   At seventeen years many their fortunes seek,   But at fourscore it is too late a week.   Yet fortune cannot recompense me better   Than to die well and not my master’s debtor.      [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE IV. The Forest of Arden       Enter  Rosalind  as Ganymede,   Celia  as Aliena, and   Touchstone .        ROSALIND.   O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!        TOUCHSTONE.   I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.        ROSALIND.   I could find in my heart to disgrace my man’s apparel, and to cry like a woman,  but I must comfort the weaker vessel, as doublet and hose ought to show itself  courageous to petticoat. Therefore, courage, good Aliena.        CELIA.   I pray you bear with me, I cannot go no further.        TOUCHSTONE.   For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear you. Yet I should bear no  cross if I did bear you, for I think you have no money in your purse.        ROSALIND.   Well, this is the forest of Arden.        TOUCHSTONE.   Ay, now am I in Arden, the more fool I! When I was at home I was in a better  place, but travellers must be content.        Enter  Corin  and   Silvius .        ROSALIND.   Ay, be so, good Touchstone. Look you, who comes here? A young man and an old  in solemn talk.        CORIN.   That is the way to make her scorn you still.        SILVIUS.   O Corin, that thou knew’st how I do love her!        CORIN.   I partly guess, for I have loved ere now.        SILVIUS.   No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,   Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover   As ever sighed upon a midnight pillow.   But if thy love were ever like to mine—   As sure I think did never man love so—   How many actions most ridiculous   Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?        CORIN.   Into a thousand that I have forgotten.        SILVIUS.   O, thou didst then never love so heartily!   If thou rememb’rest not the slightest folly   That ever love did make thee run into,   Thou hast not loved.   Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,   Wearing thy hearer in thy mistress’ praise,   Thou hast not loved.   Or if thou hast not broke from company   Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,   Thou hast not loved.   O Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe!      [ Exit  Silvius . ]      ROSALIND.   Alas, poor shepherd, searching of thy wound,   I have by hard adventure found mine own.        TOUCHSTONE.   And I mine. I remember when I was in love I broke my sword upon a stone and  bid him take that for coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I remember the kissing  of her batlet, and the cow’s dugs that her pretty chopped hands had milked; and  I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took two cods,  and, giving her them again, said with weeping tears, “Wear these for my sake.”  We that are true lovers run into strange capers. But as all is mortal in  nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.        ROSALIND.   Thou speak’st wiser than thou art ware of.        TOUCHSTONE.   Nay, I shall ne’er be ware of mine own wit till I break my shins against it.        ROSALIND.   Jove, Jove, this shepherd’s passion   Is much upon my fashion.        TOUCHSTONE.   And mine, but it grows something stale with me.        CELIA.   I pray you, one of you question yond man   If he for gold will give us any food.   I faint almost to death.        TOUCHSTONE.   Holla, you clown!        ROSALIND.   Peace, fool, he’s not thy kinsman.        CORIN.   Who calls?        TOUCHSTONE.   Your betters, sir.        CORIN.   Else are they very wretched.        ROSALIND.   Peace, I say.—Good even to you, friend.        CORIN.   And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.        ROSALIND.   I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold   Can in this desert place buy entertainment,   Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed.   Here’s a young maid with travel much oppressed,   And faints for succour.        CORIN.   Fair sir, I pity her   And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,   My fortunes were more able to relieve her.   But I am shepherd to another man   And do not shear the fleeces that I graze.   My master is of churlish disposition   And little recks to find the way to heaven   By doing deeds of hospitality.   Besides, his cote, his flocks, and bounds of feed   Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now,   By reason of his absence, there is nothing   That you will feed on. But what is, come see,   And in my voice most welcome shall you be.        ROSALIND.   What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?        CORIN.   That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,   That little cares for buying anything.        ROSALIND.   I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,   Buy thou the cottage, pasture, and the flock,   And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.        CELIA.   And we will mend thy wages. I like this place,   And willingly could waste my time in it.        CORIN.   Assuredly the thing is to be sold.   Go with me. If you like upon report   The soil, the profit, and this kind of life,   I will your very faithful feeder be,   And buy it with your gold right suddenly.      [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE V. Another part of the Forest     Enter  Amiens, Jaques  and  others.      AMIENS.   [ Sings .]        \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Under the greenwood tree,   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Who loves to lie with me   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0And turn his merry note   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Unto the sweet bird’s throat,   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Come hither, come hither, come hither!   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Here shall he see   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0No enemy   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0But winter and rough weather.        JAQUES.   More, more, I prithee, more.        AMIENS.   It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.        JAQUES.   I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck melancholy out of a song as a  weasel sucks eggs. More, I prithee, more.        AMIENS.   My voice is ragged. I know I cannot please you.        JAQUES.   I do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to sing. Come, more, another   stanzo . Call you ’em  stanzos?         AMIENS.   What you will, Monsieur Jaques.        JAQUES.   Nay, I care not for their names. They owe me nothing. Will you sing?        AMIENS.   More at your request than to please myself.        JAQUES.   Well then, if ever I thank any man, I’ll thank you; but that they call  compliment is like th’ encounter of two dog-apes. And when a man thanks me  heartily, methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me the beggarly  thanks. Come, sing; and you that will not, hold your tongues.        AMIENS.   Well, I’ll end the song.—Sirs, cover the while. The Duke will drink under this  tree; he hath been all this day to look you.        JAQUES.   And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is too disputable for my company.  I think of as many matters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make no boast  of them. Come, warble, come.        AMIENS.   [ Sings .]        \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Who doth ambition shun   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0And loves to live i’ th’ sun,   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Seeking the food he eats   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0And pleased with what he gets,   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Come hither, come hither, come hither.   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Here shall he see   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0No enemy   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0But winter and rough weather.        JAQUES.   I’ll give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in despite of my  invention.        AMIENS.   And I’ll sing it.        JAQUES.   Thus it goes:        \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0If it do come to pass   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0That any man turn ass,   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Leaving his wealth and ease   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0A stubborn will to please,   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame;   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Here shall he see   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Gross fools as he,   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0An if he will come to me.        AMIENS.   What’s that “ducdame?”        JAQUES.   ’Tis a Greek invocation to call fools into a circle. I’ll go sleep if I can;  if I cannot, I’ll rail against all the first-born of Egypt.        AMIENS.   And I’ll go seek the Duke; his banquet is prepared.      [ Exeunt severally. ]        SCENE VI. Another part of the Forest       Enter  Orlando  and   Adam .        ADAM.   Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food! Here lie I down and  measure out my grave. Farewell, kind master.        ORLANDO.   Why, how now, Adam? No greater heart in thee? Live a little, comfort a little,  cheer thyself a little. If this uncouth forest yield anything savage, I will  either be food for it or bring it for food to thee. Thy conceit is nearer death  than thy powers. For my sake, be comfortable. Hold death awhile at the arm’s  end. I will here be with thee presently, and if I bring thee not something to  eat, I’ll give thee leave to die. But if thou diest before I come, thou art a  mocker of my labour. Well said, thou look’st cheerly, and I’ll be with thee  quickly. Yet thou liest in the bleak air. Come, I will bear thee to some  shelter and thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner if there live anything in  this desert. Cheerly, good Adam!      [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE VII. Another part of the Forest     Enter  Duke Senior, Amiens   and  Lords  as outlaws.      DUKE SENIOR.   I think he be transformed into a beast,   For I can nowhere find him like a man.        FIRST LORD.   My lord, he is but even now gone hence;   Here was he merry, hearing of a song.        DUKE SENIOR.   If he, compact of jars, grow musical,   We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.   Go seek him, tell him I would speak with him.      Enter  Jaques .      FIRST LORD.   He saves my labour by his own approach.        DUKE SENIOR.   Why, how now, monsieur? What a life is this   That your poor friends must woo your company?   What, you look merrily.        JAQUES.   A fool, a fool! I met a fool i’ th’ forest,   A motley fool. A miserable world!   As I do live by food, I met a fool,   Who laid him down and basked him in the sun,   And railed on Lady Fortune in good terms,   In good set terms, and yet a motley fool.   “Good morrow, fool,” quoth I. “No, sir,” quoth he,   “Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune.”   And then he drew a dial from his poke,   And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,   Says very wisely, “It is ten o’clock.   Thus we may see,” quoth he, “how the world wags.   ’Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,   And after one hour more ’twill be eleven.   And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe,   And then from hour to hour we rot and rot,   And thereby hangs a tale.” When I did hear   The motley fool thus moral on the time,   My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,   That fools should be so deep-contemplative,   And I did laugh sans intermission   An hour by his dial. O noble fool!   A worthy fool! Motley’s the only wear.        DUKE SENIOR.   What fool is this?        JAQUES.   O worthy fool!—One that hath been a courtier,   And says if ladies be but young and fair,   They have the gift to know it. And in his brain,   Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit   After a voyage, he hath strange places crammed   With observation, the which he vents   In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!   I am ambitious for a motley coat.        DUKE SENIOR.   Thou shalt have one.        JAQUES.   It is my only suit,   Provided that you weed your better judgements   Of all opinion that grows rank in them   That I am wise. I must have liberty   Withal, as large a charter as the wind,   To blow on whom I please, for so fools have.   And they that are most galled with my folly,   They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?   The “why” is plain as way to parish church.   He that a fool doth very wisely hit   Doth very foolishly, although he smart,   Not to seem senseless of the bob. If not,   The wise man’s folly is anatomized   Even by the squandering glances of the fool.   Invest me in my motley. Give me leave   To speak my mind, and I will through and through   Cleanse the foul body of th’ infected world,   If they will patiently receive my medicine.        DUKE SENIOR.   Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.        JAQUES.   What, for a counter, would I do but good?        DUKE SENIOR.   Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin;   For thou thyself hast been a libertine,   As sensual as the brutish sting itself,   And all th’ embossed sores and headed evils   That thou with license of free foot hast caught   Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.        JAQUES.   Why, who cries out on pride   That can therein tax any private party?   Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea   Till that the weary very means do ebb?   What woman in the city do I name   When that I say the city-woman bears   The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?   Who can come in and say that I mean her,   When such a one as she, such is her neighbour?   Or what is he of basest function   That says his bravery is not on my cost,   Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits   His folly to the mettle of my speech?   There then. How then, what then? Let me see wherein   My tongue hath wronged him. If it do him right,   Then he hath wronged himself. If he be free,   Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies   Unclaimed of any man. But who comes here?      Enter  Orlando  with sword  drawn.      ORLANDO.   Forbear, and eat no more.        JAQUES.   Why, I have eat none yet.        ORLANDO.   Nor shalt not till necessity be served.        JAQUES.   Of what kind should this cock come of?        DUKE SENIOR.   Art thou thus boldened, man, by thy distress?   Or else a rude despiser of good manners,   That in civility thou seem’st so empty?        ORLANDO.   You touched my vein at first. The thorny point   Of bare distress hath ta’en from me the show   Of smooth civility; yet am I inland bred   And know some nurture. But forbear, I say!   He dies that touches any of this fruit   Till I and my affairs are answered.        JAQUES.   An you will not be answered with reason, I must die.        DUKE SENIOR.   What would you have? Your gentleness shall force   More than your force move us to gentleness.        ORLANDO.   I almost die for food, and let me have it.        DUKE SENIOR.   Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.        ORLANDO.   Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you.   I thought that all things had been savage here   And therefore put I on the countenance   Of stern commandment. But whate’er you are   That in this desert inaccessible,   Under the shade of melancholy boughs,   Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time,   If ever you have looked on better days,   If ever been where bells have knolled to church,   If ever sat at any good man’s feast,   If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear,   And know what ’tis to pity and be pitied,   Let gentleness my strong enforcement be,   In the which hope I blush and hide my sword.        DUKE SENIOR.   True is it that we have seen better days,   And have with holy bell been knolled to church,   And sat at good men’s feasts, and wiped our eyes   Of drops that sacred pity hath engendered.   And therefore sit you down in gentleness,   And take upon command what help we have   That to your wanting may be ministered.        ORLANDO.   Then but forbear your food a little while,   Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn,   And give it food. There is an old poor man   Who after me hath many a weary step   Limped in pure love. Till he be first sufficed,   Oppressed with two weak evils, age and hunger,   I will not touch a bit.        DUKE SENIOR.   Go find him out,   And we will nothing waste till you return.        ORLANDO.   I thank ye, and be blest for your good comfort.      [ Exit. ]      DUKE SENIOR.   Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy.   This wide and universal theatre   Presents more woeful pageants than the scene   Wherein we play in.        JAQUES.   All the world’s a stage,   And all the men and women merely players;   They have their exits and their entrances,   And one man in his time plays many parts,   His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,   Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms;   Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel   And shining morning face, creeping like snail   Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,   Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad   Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,   Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,   Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,   Seeking the bubble reputation   Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,   In fair round belly with good capon lined,   With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,   Full of wise saws and modern instances;   And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts   Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,   With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,   His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide   For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,   Turning again toward childish treble, pipes   And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,   That ends this strange eventful history,   Is second childishness and mere oblivion,   Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.        Enter  Orlando  bearing   Adam .        DUKE SENIOR.   Welcome. Set down your venerable burden,   And let him feed.        ORLANDO.   I thank you most for him.        ADAM.   So had you need;   I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.        DUKE SENIOR.   Welcome, fall to. I will not trouble you   As yet to question you about your fortunes.   Give us some music, and good cousin, sing.        SONG.        AMIENS.

DUKE SENIOR.   If that you were the good Sir Rowland’s son,   As you have whispered faithfully you were,   And as mine eye doth his effigies witness   Most truly limned and living in your face,   Be truly welcome hither. I am the Duke   That loved your father. The residue of your fortune   Go to my cave and tell me.—Good old man,   Thou art right welcome as thy master is.   Support him by the arm. [ To Orlando .] Give me your hand,   And let me all your fortunes understand.      [ Exeunt. ]               ACT III       SCENE I. A Room in the Palace     Enter  Duke Frederick, Lords   and  Oliver .      DUKE FREDERICK.   Not see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be.   But were I not the better part made mercy,   I should not seek an absent argument   Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it:   Find out thy brother wheresoe’er he is.   Seek him with candle. Bring him dead or living   Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more   To seek a living in our territory.   Thy lands, and all things that thou dost call thine   Worth seizure, do we seize into our hands,   Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother’s mouth   Of what we think against thee.        OLIVER.   O that your highness knew my heart in this:   I never loved my brother in my life.        DUKE FREDERICK.   More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors,   And let my officers of such a nature   Make an extent upon his house and lands.   Do this expediently, and turn him going.      [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE II. The Forest of Arden     Enter  Orlando  with a  paper.      ORLANDO.   Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love.   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0And thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, survey   With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Thy huntress’ name that my full life doth sway.

Run, run, Orlando, carve on every tree   The fair, the chaste, and unexpressive she.      [ Exit. ]      Enter  Corin  and   Touchstone .        CORIN.   And how like you this shepherd’s life, Master Touchstone?        TOUCHSTONE.   Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good life; but in respect that  it is a shepherd’s life, it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I like  it very well; but in respect that it is private, it is a very vile life. Now in  respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect it is not in  the court, it is tedious. As it is a spare life, look you, it fits my humour  well; but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much against my stomach.  Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?        CORIN.   No more but that I know the more one sickens, the worse at ease he is; and that  he that wants money, means, and content is without three good friends; that  the property of rain is to wet, and fire to burn; that good pasture makes fat  sheep; and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that  hath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding or comes  of a very dull kindred.        TOUCHSTONE.   Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in court, shepherd?        CORIN.   No, truly.        TOUCHSTONE.   Then thou art damned.        CORIN.   Nay, I hope.        TOUCHSTONE.   Truly, thou art damned, like an ill-roasted egg, all on one side.        CORIN.   For not being at court? Your reason.        TOUCHSTONE.   Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never saw’st good manners; if thou never  saw’st good manners, then thy manners must be wicked, and wickedness is sin,  and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous state, shepherd.        CORIN.   Not a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good manners at the court are as  ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the country is most mockable at  the court. You told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands.  That courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.        TOUCHSTONE.   Instance, briefly. Come, instance.        CORIN.   Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their fells, you know, are greasy.        TOUCHSTONE.   Why, do not your courtier’s hands sweat? And is not the grease of a mutton as  wholesome as the sweat of a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say.  Come.        CORIN.   Besides, our hands are hard.        TOUCHSTONE.   Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again. A more sounder instance,  come.        CORIN.   And they are often tarred over with the surgery of our sheep; and would you  have us kiss tar? The courtier’s hands are perfumed with civet.        TOUCHSTONE.   Most shallow man! Thou worm’s meat in respect of a good piece of flesh  indeed! Learn of the wise and perpend. Civet is of a baser birth than tar, the  very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.        CORIN.   You have too courtly a wit for me. I’ll rest.        TOUCHSTONE.   Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man! God make incision in thee,  thou art raw.        CORIN.   Sir, I am a true labourer. I earn that I eat, get that I wear, owe no man hate,  envy no man’s happiness, glad of other men’s good, content with my harm; and  the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck.        TOUCHSTONE.   That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes and the rams together and  to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a  bell-wether and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to crooked-pated, old,  cuckoldly ram, out of all reasonable match. If thou be’st not damned for this,  the devil himself will have no shepherds. I cannot see else how thou shouldst  ’scape.      Enter  Rosalind  as Ganymede.        CORIN.   Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress’s brother.        ROSALIND.

This is the very false gallop of verses. Why do you infect yourself with them?        ROSALIND.   Peace, you dull fool, I found them on a tree.        TOUCHSTONE.   Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.        ROSALIND.   I’ll graft it with you, and then I shall graft it with a medlar. Then it will  be the earliest fruit i’ th’ country, for you’ll be rotten ere you be half  ripe, and that’s the right virtue of the medlar.        TOUCHSTONE.   You have said, but whether wisely or no, let the forest judge.      Enter  Celia  as Aliena,  reading a paper.      ROSALIND.   Peace, here comes my sister, reading. Stand aside.        CELIA.

Shepherd, go off a little. Go with him, sirrah.        TOUCHSTONE.   Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat, though not with bag and  baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.        [ Exeunt  Corin  and   Touchstone . ]        CELIA.   Didst thou hear these verses?        ROSALIND.   O yes, I heard them all, and more too, for some of them had in them more feet  than the verses would bear.        CELIA.   That’s no matter. The feet might bear the verses.        ROSALIND.   Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves without the verse,  and therefore stood lamely in the verse.        CELIA.   But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hanged and carved  upon these trees?        ROSALIND.   I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you came; for look here  what I found on a palm-tree. I was never so berhymed since Pythagoras’ time  that I was an Irish rat, which I can hardly remember.        CELIA.   Trow you who hath done this?        ROSALIND.   Is it a man?        CELIA.   And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck. Change you colour?        ROSALIND.   I prithee, who?        CELIA.   O Lord, Lord, it is a hard matter for friends to meet; but mountains may be  removed with earthquakes and so encounter.        ROSALIND.   Nay, but who is it?        CELIA.   Is it possible?        ROSALIND.   Nay, I prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell me who it is.        CELIA.   O wonderful, wonderful, most wonderful wonderful, and yet again wonderful, and  after that, out of all whooping!        ROSALIND.   Good my complexion! Dost thou think, though I am caparisoned like a man, I have  a doublet and hose in my disposition? One inch of delay more is a South Sea of  discovery. I prithee tell me who is it quickly, and speak apace. I would thou  couldst stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man out of thy mouth, as  wine comes out of narrow-mouthed bottle—either too much at once or none at  all. I prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that I may drink thy tidings.        CELIA.   So you may put a man in your belly.        ROSALIND.   Is he of God’s making? What manner of man? Is his head worth a hat, or his chin  worth a beard?        CELIA.   Nay, he hath but a little beard.        ROSALIND.   Why, God will send more if the man will be thankful. Let me stay the growth of  his beard, if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.        CELIA.   It is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler’s heels and your heart both  in an instant.        ROSALIND.   Nay, but the devil take mocking! Speak sad brow and true maid.        CELIA.   I’ faith, coz, ’tis he.        ROSALIND.   Orlando?        CELIA.   Orlando.        ROSALIND.   Alas the day, what shall I do with my doublet and hose? What did he when thou  saw’st him? What said he? How looked he? Wherein went he? What makes he here?  Did he ask for me? Where remains he? How parted he with thee? And when shalt  thou see him again? Answer me in one word.        CELIA.   You must borrow me Gargantua’s mouth first. ’Tis a word too great for any mouth  of this age’s size. To say ay and no to these particulars is more than to  answer in a catechism.        ROSALIND.   But doth he know that I am in this forest and in man’s apparel? Looks he as  freshly as he did the day he wrestled?        CELIA.   It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the propositions of a lover. But  take a taste of my finding him, and relish it with good observance. I found him  under a tree, like a dropped acorn.        ROSALIND.   It may well be called Jove’s tree when it drops forth such fruit.        CELIA.   Give me audience, good madam.        ROSALIND.   Proceed.        CELIA.   There lay he, stretched along like a wounded knight.        ROSALIND.   Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well becomes the ground.        CELIA.   Cry “holla!” to thy tongue, I prithee. It curvets unseasonably. He was  furnished like a hunter.        ROSALIND.   O, ominous! He comes to kill my heart.        CELIA.   I would sing my song without a burden. Thou bring’st me out of tune.        ROSALIND.   Do you not know I am a woman? When I think, I must speak. Sweet, say on.        Enter  Orlando  and   Jaques .        CELIA.   You bring me out. Soft, comes he not here?        ROSALIND.   ’Tis he! Slink by, and note him.        [  Rosalind  and   Celia  step aside. ]        JAQUES.   I thank you for your company but, good faith, I had as lief have been myself  alone.        ORLANDO.   And so had I, but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you too for your society.        JAQUES.   God be wi’ you, let’s meet as little as we can.        ORLANDO.   I do desire we may be better strangers.        JAQUES.   I pray you, mar no more trees with writing love songs in their barks.        ORLANDO.   I pray you, mar no more of my verses with reading them ill-favouredly.        JAQUES.   Rosalind is your love’s name?        ORLANDO.   Yes, just.        JAQUES.   I do not like her name.        ORLANDO.   There was no thought of pleasing you when she was christened.        JAQUES.   What stature is she of?        ORLANDO.   Just as high as my heart.        JAQUES.   You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths’  wives, and conned them out of rings?        ORLANDO.   Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from whence you have studied your  questions.        JAQUES.   You have a nimble wit. I think ’twas made of Atalanta’s heels. Will you sit  down with me? And we two will rail against our mistress the world and all our  misery.        ORLANDO.   I will chide no breather in the world but myself, against whom I know most  faults.        JAQUES.   The worst fault you have is to be in love.        ORLANDO.   ’Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue. I am weary of you.        JAQUES.   By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found you.        ORLANDO.   He is drowned in the brook. Look but in, and you shall see him.        JAQUES.   There I shall see mine own figure.        ORLANDO.   Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.        JAQUES.   I’ll tarry no longer with you. Farewell, good Signior Love.        ORLANDO.   I am glad of your departure. Adieu, good Monsieur Melancholy.        [ Exit  Jaques .— Celia   and  Rosalind  come forward. ]        ROSALIND.   I will speak to him like a saucy lackey, and under that habit play the knave  with him.   Do you hear, forester?        ORLANDO.   Very well. What would you?        ROSALIND.   I pray you, what is’t o’clock?        ORLANDO.   You should ask me what time o’ day. There’s no clock in the forest.        ROSALIND.   Then there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing every minute and  groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock.        ORLANDO.   And why not the swift foot of time? Had not that been as proper?        ROSALIND.   By no means, sir. Time travels in divers paces with divers persons. I’ll tell  you who time ambles withal, who time trots withal, who time gallops withal, and  who he stands still withal.        ORLANDO.   I prithee, who doth he trot withal?        ROSALIND.   Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and  the day it is solemnized. If the interim be but a se’nnight, time’s pace is so  hard that it seems the length of seven year.        ORLANDO.   Who ambles time withal?        ROSALIND.   With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath not the gout; for the  one sleeps easily because he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because  he feels no pain; the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning, the  other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury. These time ambles withal.        ORLANDO.   Who doth he gallop withal?        ROSALIND.   With a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly as foot can fall, he  thinks himself too soon there.        ORLANDO.   Who stays it still withal?        ROSALIND.   With lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep between term and term, and then  they perceive not how time moves.        ORLANDO.   Where dwell you, pretty youth?        ROSALIND.   With this shepherdess, my sister, here in the skirts of the forest, like fringe  upon a petticoat.        ORLANDO.   Are you native of this place?        ROSALIND.   As the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled.        ORLANDO.   Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a  dwelling.        ROSALIND.   I have been told so of many. But indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught  me to speak, who was in his youth an inland man, one that knew courtship too  well, for there he fell in love. I have heard him read many lectures against  it, and I thank God I am not a woman, to be touched with so many giddy offences  as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal.        ORLANDO.   Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of  women?        ROSALIND.   There were none principal. They were all like one another as halfpence are,  every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.        ORLANDO.   I prithee recount some of them.        ROSALIND.   No. I will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick. There is a man  haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving “Rosalind” on their  barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles; all, forsooth,  deifying the name of Rosalind. If I could meet that fancy-monger, I would give  him some good counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him.        ORLANDO.   I am he that is so love-shaked. I pray you tell me your remedy.        ROSALIND.   There is none of my uncle’s marks upon you. He taught me how to know a man in  love, in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.        ORLANDO.   What were his marks?        ROSALIND.   A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken, which you have not; an  unquestionable spirit, which you have not; a beard neglected, which you have  not—but I pardon you for that, for simply your having in beard is a younger  brother’s revenue. Then your hose should be ungartered, your bonnet unbanded,  your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe untied, and everything about you  demonstrating a careless desolation. But you are no such man. You are rather  point-device in your accoutrements, as loving yourself than seeming the lover  of any other.        ORLANDO.   Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.        ROSALIND.   Me believe it? You may as soon make her that you love believe it, which I  warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does. That is one of the points  in the which women still give the lie to their consciences. But, in good sooth,  are you he that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind is so admired?        ORLANDO.   I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I am that he, that  unfortunate he.        ROSALIND.   But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?        ORLANDO.   Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.        ROSALIND.   Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a  whip as madmen do; and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is  that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too. Yet I profess  curing it by counsel.        ORLANDO.   Did you ever cure any so?        ROSALIND.   Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me his love, his mistress, and  I set him every day to woo me; at which time would I, being but a moonish  youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing and liking, proud,  fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; for  every passion something and for no passion truly anything, as boys and women  are for the most part cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe  him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep for him, then spit at him;  that I drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of  madness, which was to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a  nook merely monastic. And thus I cured him, and this way will I take upon me to  wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep’s heart, that there shall not be one  spot of love in ’t.        ORLANDO.   I would not be cured, youth.        ROSALIND.   I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind and come every day to my  cote and woo me.        ORLANDO.   Now, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it is.        ROSALIND.   Go with me to it, and I’ll show it you; and by the way you shall tell me  where in the forest you live. Will you go?        ORLANDO.   With all my heart, good youth.        ROSALIND.   Nay, you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?      [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE III. Another part of the Forest       Enter  Touchstone  and   Audrey; Jaques  at a distance observing them.        TOUCHSTONE.   Come apace, good Audrey. I will fetch up your goats, Audrey. And how, Audrey?  Am I the man yet? Doth my simple feature content you?        AUDREY.   Your features, Lord warrant us! What features?        TOUCHSTONE.   I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most capricious poet, honest Ovid,  was among the Goths.        JAQUES.   [ Aside .] O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove in a thatched house!        TOUCHSTONE.   When a man’s verses cannot be understood, nor a man’s good wit seconded with  the forward child, understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a great  reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical.        AUDREY.   I do not know what “poetical” is. Is it honest in deed and word? Is it a true  thing?        TOUCHSTONE.   No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning, and lovers are given to  poetry, and what they swear in poetry may be said, as lovers, they do feign.        AUDREY.   Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?        TOUCHSTONE.   I do, truly, for thou swear’st to me thou art honest. Now if thou wert a poet,  I might have some hope thou didst feign.        AUDREY.   Would you not have me honest?        TOUCHSTONE.   No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; for honesty coupled to beauty is to  have honey a sauce to sugar.        JAQUES.   [ Aside .] A material fool!        AUDREY.   Well, I am not fair, and therefore I pray the gods make me honest.        TOUCHSTONE.   Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an  unclean dish.        AUDREY.   I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.        TOUCHSTONE.   Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness; sluttishness may come hereafter.  But be it as it may be, I will marry thee. And to that end I have been with Sir  Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next village, who hath promised to meet me in  this place of the forest and to couple us.        JAQUES.   [ Aside .] I would fain see this meeting.        AUDREY.   Well, the gods give us joy!        TOUCHSTONE.   Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger in this attempt, for  here we have no temple but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what  though? Courage! As horns are odious, they are necessary. It is said, “Many a  man knows no end of his goods.” Right. Many a man has good horns and knows no  end of them. Well, that is the dowry of his wife; ’tis none of his own getting.  Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no, the noblest deer hath them as huge as  the rascal. Is the single man therefore blessed? No. As a walled town is more  worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a married man more honourable  than the bare brow of a bachelor. And by how much defence is better than no  skill, by so much is horn more precious than to want.      Enter  Sir Oliver Martext .      Here comes Sir Oliver. Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met. Will you dispatch  us here under this tree, or shall we go with you to your chapel?        MARTEXT.   Is there none here to give the woman?        TOUCHSTONE.   I will not take her on gift of any man.        MARTEXT.   Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.        JAQUES.   [ Coming forward .] Proceed, proceed. I’ll give her.        TOUCHSTONE.   Good even, good Master What-ye-call’t, how do you, sir? You are very well  met. God ’ild you for your last company. I am very glad to see you. Even a toy  in hand here, sir. Nay, pray be covered.        JAQUES.   Will you be married, motley?        TOUCHSTONE.   As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and the falcon her bells, so  man hath his desires; and as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.        JAQUES.   And will you, being a man of your breeding, be married under a bush like a  beggar? Get you to church, and have a good priest that can tell you what  marriage is. This fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot; then  one of you will prove a shrunk panel, and like green timber, warp, warp.        TOUCHSTONE.   [ Aside .] I am not in the mind but I were better to be married of him than of  another, for he is not like to marry me well, and not being well married, it  will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.        JAQUES.   Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.        TOUCHSTONE.   Come, sweet Audrey. We must be married, or we must live in bawdry.   Farewell, good Master Oliver. Not   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 O sweet Oliver,   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0O brave Oliver,   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Leave me not behind thee.    But   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Wind away,—   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Begone, I say,   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0I will not to wedding with thee.         [ Exeunt  Touchstone, Audrey  and   Jaques . ]        MARTEXT.   ’Tis no matter. Ne’er a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my  calling.      [ Exit. ]        SCENE IV. Another part of the Forest. Before a Cottage       Enter  Rosalind  and   Celia .        ROSALIND.   Never talk to me, I will weep.        CELIA.   Do, I prithee, but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a  man.        ROSALIND.   But have I not cause to weep?        CELIA.   As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.        ROSALIND.   His very hair is of the dissembling colour.        CELIA.   Something browner than Judas’s. Marry, his kisses are Judas’s own children.        ROSALIND.   I’ faith, his hair is of a good colour.        CELIA.   An excellent colour. Your chestnut was ever the only colour.        ROSALIND.   And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread.        CELIA.   He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana. A nun of winter’s sisterhood  kisses not more religiously; the very ice of chastity is in them.        ROSALIND.   But why did he swear he would come this morning, and comes not?        CELIA.   Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.        ROSALIND.   Do you think so?        CELIA.   Yes. I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer, but for his verity in  love, I do think him as concave as a covered goblet or a worm-eaten nut.        ROSALIND.   Not true in love?        CELIA.   Yes, when he is in, but I think he is not in.        ROSALIND.   You have heard him swear downright he was.        CELIA.   “Was” is not “is”. Besides, the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of  a tapster. They are both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends here in  the forest on the Duke your father.        ROSALIND.   I met the Duke yesterday, and had much question with him. He asked me of what  parentage I was. I told him, of as good as he, so he laughed and let me go. But  what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as Orlando?        CELIA.   O, that’s a brave man! He writes brave verses, speaks brave words, swears brave  oaths, and breaks them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of his lover,  as a puny tilter, that spurs his horse but on one side, breaks his staff like a  noble goose. But all’s brave that youth mounts and folly guides. Who comes  here?      Enter  Corin .      CORIN.   Mistress and master, you have oft enquired   After the shepherd that complained of love,   Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,   Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess   That was his mistress.        CELIA.   Well, and what of him?        CORIN.   If you will see a pageant truly played   Between the pale complexion of true love   And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,   Go hence a little, and I shall conduct you,   If you will mark it.        ROSALIND.   O, come, let us remove.   The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.   Bring us to this sight, and you shall say   I’ll prove a busy actor in their play.      [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE V. Another part of the Forest       Enter  Silvius  and   Phoebe .        SILVIUS.   Sweet Phoebe, do not scorn me, do not, Phoebe.   Say that you love me not, but say not so   In bitterness. The common executioner,   Whose heart th’ accustomed sight of death makes hard,   Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck   But first begs pardon. Will you sterner be   Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?        Enter  Rosalind, Celia  and   Corin , at a distance.        PHOEBE.   I would not be thy executioner;   I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.   Thou tell’st me there is murder in mine eye.   ’Tis pretty, sure, and very probable   That eyes, that are the frail’st and softest things,   Who shut their coward gates on atomies,   Should be called tyrants, butchers, murderers.   Now I do frown on thee with all my heart,   And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee.   Now counterfeit to swoon; why, now fall down;   Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,   Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers.   Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee.   Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains   Some scar of it; lean upon a rush,   The cicatrice and capable impressure   Thy palm some moment keeps. But now mine eyes,   Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not;   Nor I am sure there is not force in eyes   That can do hurt.        SILVIUS.   O dear Phoebe,   If ever—as that ever may be near—   You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,   Then shall you know the wounds invisible   That love’s keen arrows make.        PHOEBE.   But till that time   Come not thou near me. And when that time comes,   Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not,   As till that time I shall not pity thee.        ROSALIND.   [ Advancing .] And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,   That you insult, exult, and all at once,   Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty—   As, by my faith, I see no more in you   Than without candle may go dark to bed—   Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?   Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?   I see no more in you than in the ordinary   Of nature’s sale-work. ’Od’s my little life,   I think she means to tangle my eyes too!   No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it.   ’Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,   Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,   That can entame my spirits to your worship.   You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,   Like foggy south, puffing with wind and rain?   You are a thousand times a properer man   Than she a woman. ’Tis such fools as you   That makes the world full of ill-favoured children.   ’Tis not her glass but you that flatters her,   And out of you she sees herself more proper   Than any of her lineaments can show her.   But, mistress, know yourself; down on your knees,   And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man’s love.   For I must tell you friendly in your ear,   Sell when you can; you are not for all markets.   Cry the man mercy, love him, take his offer;   Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.   So take her to thee, shepherd. Fare you well.        PHOEBE.   Sweet youth, I pray you chide a year together!   I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.        ROSALIND.   He’s fall’n in love with your foulness, and she’ll fall in love with my anger.  If it be so, as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks, I’ll sauce her  with bitter words. Why look you so upon me?        PHOEBE.   For no ill will I bear you.        ROSALIND.   I pray you do not fall in love with me,   For I am falser than vows made in wine.   Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,   ’Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.   Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.   Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,   And be not proud. Though all the world could see,   None could be so abused in sight as he.   Come, to our flock.        [ Exeunt  Rosalind, Celia  and   Corin . ]        PHOEBE.   Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might:   “Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?”        SILVIUS.   Sweet Phoebe—        PHOEBE.   Ha, what sayst thou, Silvius?        SILVIUS.   Sweet Phoebe, pity me.        PHOEBE.   Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.        SILVIUS.   Wherever sorrow is, relief would be.   If you do sorrow at my grief in love,   By giving love your sorrow and my grief   Were both extermined.        PHOEBE.   Thou hast my love. Is not that neighbourly?        SILVIUS.   I would have you.        PHOEBE.   Why, that were covetousness.   Silvius, the time was that I hated thee;   And yet it is not that I bear thee love;   But since that thou canst talk of love so well,   Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,   I will endure, and I’ll employ thee too.   But do not look for further recompense   Than thine own gladness that thou art employed.        SILVIUS.   So holy and so perfect is my love,   And I in such a poverty of grace,   That I shall think it a most plenteous crop   To glean the broken ears after the man   That the main harvest reaps. Loose now and then   A scattered smile, and that I’ll live upon.        PHOEBE.   Know’st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?        SILVIUS.   Not very well, but I have met him oft,   And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds   That the old carlot once was master of.        PHOEBE.   Think not I love him, though I ask for him.   ’Tis but a peevish boy—yet he talks well.   But what care I for words? Yet words do well   When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.   It is a pretty youth—not very pretty—   But sure he’s proud, and yet his pride becomes him.   He’ll make a proper man. The best thing in him   Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue   Did make offence, his eye did heal it up.   He is not very tall, yet for his years he’s tall;   His leg is but so-so, and yet ’tis well.   There was a pretty redness in his lip,   A little riper and more lusty red   Than that mixed in his cheek. ’Twas just the difference   Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.   There be some women, Silvius, had they marked him   In parcels as I did, would have gone near   To fall in love with him; but for my part   I love him not nor hate him not; and yet   I have more cause to hate him than to love him.   For what had he to do to chide at me?   He said mine eyes were black and my hair black,   And now I am remembered, scorned at me.   I marvel why I answered not again.   But that’s all one: omittance is no quittance.   I’ll write to him a very taunting letter,   And thou shalt bear it. Wilt thou, Silvius?        SILVIUS.   Phoebe, with all my heart.        PHOEBE.   I’ll write it straight,   The matter’s in my head and in my heart.   I will be bitter with him and passing short.   Go with me, Silvius.      [ Exeunt. ]               ACT IV       SCENE I. The Forest of Arden       Enter  Rosalind, Celia  and   Jaques .        JAQUES.   I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with thee.        ROSALIND.   They say you are a melancholy fellow.        JAQUES.   I am so; I do love it better than laughing.        ROSALIND.   Those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows, and betray  themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards.        JAQUES.   Why, ’tis good to be sad and say nothing.        ROSALIND.   Why then, ’tis good to be a post.        JAQUES.   I have neither the scholar’s melancholy, which is emulation; nor the  musician’s, which is fantastical; nor the courtier’s, which is proud; nor the  soldier’s, which is ambitious; nor the lawyer’s, which is politic; nor the  lady’s, which is nice; nor the lover’s, which is all these; but it is a  melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted from many  objects, and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels, in which my often  rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness.        ROSALIND.   A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be sad. I fear you have sold  your own lands to see other men’s. Then to have seen much and to have nothing  is to have rich eyes and poor hands.        JAQUES.   Yes, I have gained my experience.        ROSALIND.   And your experience makes you sad. I had rather have a fool to make me merry  than experience to make me sad—and to travel for it too.      Enter  Orlando .      ORLANDO.   Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind!        JAQUES.   Nay, then, God be wi’ you, an you talk in blank verse.        ROSALIND.   Farewell, Monsieur Traveller. Look you lisp and wear strange suits; disable all  the benefits of your own country; be out of love with your nativity, and almost  chide God for making you that countenance you are, or I will scarce think you  have swam in a gondola.      [ Exit  Jaques . ]      Why, how now, Orlando, where have you been all this while? You a lover! An you  serve me such another trick, never come in my sight more.        ORLANDO.   My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.        ROSALIND.   Break an hour’s promise in love? He that will divide a minute into a thousand  parts, and break but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs of  love, it may be said of him that Cupid hath clapped him o’ the shoulder, but  I’ll warrant him heart-whole.        ORLANDO.   Pardon me, dear Rosalind.        ROSALIND.   Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had as lief be wooed of a  snail.        ORLANDO.   Of a snail?        ROSALIND.   Ay, of a snail, for though he comes slowly, he carries his house on his head—a  better jointure, I think, than you make a woman. Besides, he brings his destiny  with him.        ORLANDO.   What’s that?        ROSALIND.   Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for. But  he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.        ORLANDO.   Virtue is no horn-maker and my Rosalind is virtuous.        ROSALIND.   And I am your Rosalind.        CELIA.   It pleases him to call you so, but he hath a Rosalind of a better leer than  you.        ROSALIND.   Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday humour, and like enough to  consent. What would you say to me now, an I were your very, very Rosalind?        ORLANDO.   I would kiss before I spoke.        ROSALIND.   Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were gravelled for lack of  matter, you might take occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are out,  they will spit; and for lovers lacking—God warn us—matter, the cleanliest  shift is to kiss.        ORLANDO.   How if the kiss be denied?        ROSALIND.   Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.        ORLANDO.   Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?        ROSALIND.   Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or I should think my honesty  ranker than my wit.        ORLANDO.   What, of my suit?        ROSALIND.   Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit. Am not I your Rosalind?        ORLANDO.   I take some joy to say you are because I would be talking of her.        ROSALIND.   Well, in her person, I say I will not have you.        ORLANDO.   Then, in mine own person, I die.        ROSALIND.   No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six thousand years old,  and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person,   videlicet , in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains dashed out with a  Grecian club, yet he did what he could to die before, and he is one of the  patterns of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair year though Hero had  turned nun, if it had not been for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he  went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and, being taken with the cramp,  was drowned; and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was Hero of  Sestos. But these are all lies. Men have died from time to time and worms have  eaten them, but not for love.        ORLANDO.   I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind, for I protest her frown  might kill me.        ROSALIND.   By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I will be your Rosalind in  a more coming-on disposition, and ask me what you will, I will grant it.        ORLANDO.   Then love me, Rosalind.        ROSALIND.   Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.        ORLANDO.   And wilt thou have me?        ROSALIND.   Ay, and twenty such.        ORLANDO.   What sayest thou?        ROSALIND.   Are you not good?        ORLANDO.   I hope so.        ROSALIND.   Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?—Come, sister, you shall be  the priest and marry us.—Give me your hand, Orlando.—What do you say, sister?        ORLANDO.   Pray thee, marry us.        CELIA.   I cannot say the words.        ROSALIND.   You must begin “Will you, Orlando—”          CELIA.   Go to.—Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?        ORLANDO.   I will.        ROSALIND.   Ay, but when?        ORLANDO.   Why now, as fast as she can marry us.        ROSALIND.   Then you must say “I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.”        ORLANDO.   I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.        ROSALIND.   I might ask you for your commission. But I do take thee, Orlando, for my  husband. There’s a girl goes before the priest, and certainly a woman’s  thought runs before her actions.        ORLANDO.   So do all thoughts. They are winged.        ROSALIND.   Now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her.        ORLANDO.   For ever and a day.        ROSALIND.   Say “a day” without the “ever.” No, no, Orlando, men are April when they woo,  December when they wed. Maids are May when they are maids, but the sky changes  when they are wives. I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon  over his hen, more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more new-fangled than  an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey. I will weep for nothing, like  Diana in the fountain, and I will do that when you are disposed to be merry. I  will laugh like a hyena, and that when thou are inclined to sleep.        ORLANDO.   But will my Rosalind do so?        ROSALIND.   By my life, she will do as I do.        ORLANDO.   O, but she is wise.        ROSALIND.   Or else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser, the waywarder. Make  the doors upon a woman’s wit, and it will out at the casement. Shut that, and  ’twill out at the keyhole. Stop that, ’twill fly with the smoke out at the  chimney.        ORLANDO.   A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say, “Wit, whither wilt?”        ROSALIND.   Nay, you might keep that check for it till you met your wife’s wit going to  your neighbour’s bed.        ORLANDO.   And what wit could wit have to excuse that?        ROSALIND.   Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never take her without her  answer unless you take her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot make  her fault her husband’s occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for  she will breed it like a fool.        ORLANDO.   For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.        ROSALIND.   Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.        ORLANDO.   I must attend the Duke at dinner. By two o’clock I will be with thee again.        ROSALIND.   Ay, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would prove. My friends told me  as much, and I thought no less. That flattering tongue of yours won me. ’Tis  but one cast away, and so, come death! Two o’clock is your hour?        ORLANDO.   Ay, sweet Rosalind.        ROSALIND.   By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and by all pretty oaths  that are not dangerous, if you break one jot of your promise or come one  minute behind your hour, I will think you the most pathetical break-promise,  and the most hollow lover, and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that  may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful. Therefore beware my  censure, and keep your promise.        ORLANDO.   With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind. So, adieu.        ROSALIND.   Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such offenders, and let time  try. Adieu.      [ Exit  Orlando . ]      CELIA.   You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate! We must have your doublet  and hose plucked over your head and show the world what the bird hath done to  her own nest.        ROSALIND.   O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst know how many fathom  deep I am in love! But it cannot be sounded; my affection hath an unknown  bottom, like the Bay of Portugal.        CELIA.   Or rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour affection in, it runs out.        ROSALIND.   No, that same wicked bastard of Venus, that was begot of thought, conceived of  spleen, and born of madness, that blind rascally boy that abuses everyone’s  eyes because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I am in love. I’ll  tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando. I’ll go find a  shadow and sigh till he come.        CELIA.   And I’ll sleep.      [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE II. Another part of the Forest     Enter  Jaques  and Lords, like  foresters.      JAQUES.   Which is he that killed the deer?        FIRST LORD.   Sir, it was I.        JAQUES.   Let’s present him to the Duke, like a Roman conqueror, and it would do well to  set the deer’s horns upon his head for a branch of victory. Have you no song,  forester, for this purpose?        SECOND LORD.   Yes, sir.        JAQUES.   Sing it. ’Tis no matter how it be in tune, so it make noise enough.        SONG        SECOND LORD.   [ Sings .]   \\xa0 What shall he have that killed the deer?   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0His leather skin and horns to wear.   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Then sing him home:   \\xa0\\xa0[ The rest shall bear this burden .]   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Take thou no scorn to wear the horn.   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0It was a crest ere thou wast born.   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Thy father’s father wore it   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0And thy father bore it.   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The horn, the horn, the lusty horn   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.      [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE III. Another part of the Forest       Enter  Rosalind  and   Celia .        ROSALIND.   How say you now? Is it not past two o’clock? And here much Orlando.        CELIA.   I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain he hath ta’en his bow and  arrows and is gone forth to sleep.      Enter  Silvius .      Look who comes here.        SILVIUS.   My errand is to you, fair youth.   My gentle Phoebe did bid me give you this.      [ Giving a letter. ]      I know not the contents, but, as I guess   By the stern brow and waspish action   Which she did use as she was writing of it,   It bears an angry tenor. Pardon me,   I am but as a guiltless messenger.        ROSALIND.   Patience herself would startle at this letter   And play the swaggerer. Bear this, bear all!   She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;   She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,   Were man as rare as phoenix. ’Od’s my will,   Her love is not the hare that I do hunt.   Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,   This is a letter of your own device.        SILVIUS.   No, I protest, I know not the contents.   Phoebe did write it.        ROSALIND.   Come, come, you are a fool,   And turned into the extremity of love.   I saw her hand. She has a leathern hand,   A freestone-coloured hand. I verily did think   That her old gloves were on, but ’twas her hands.   She has a huswife’s hand—but that’s no matter.   I say she never did invent this letter;   This is a man’s invention, and his hand.        SILVIUS.   Sure, it is hers.        ROSALIND.   Why, ’tis a boisterous and a cruel style,   A style for challengers. Why, she defies me,   Like Turk to Christian. Women’s gentle brain   Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention,   Such Ethiop words, blacker in their effect   Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?        SILVIUS.   So please you, for I never heard it yet,   Yet heard too much of Phoebe’s cruelty.        ROSALIND.   She Phoebes me. Mark how the tyrant writes.      [ Reads. ]      \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Art thou god to shepherd turned,   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0That a maiden’s heart hath burned?

ROSALIND.   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Why, thy godhead laid apart,   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Warr’st thou with a woman’s heart?

SILVIUS.   Call you this chiding?        CELIA.   Alas, poor shepherd.        ROSALIND.   Do you pity him? No, he deserves no pity.—Wilt thou love such a woman? What, to  make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee? Not to be endured!  Well, go your way to her, for I see love hath made thee a tame snake, and say  this to her: that if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will not, I  will never have her unless thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover, hence,  and not a word, for here comes more company.      [ Exit  Silvius . ]    Enter  Oliver .      OLIVER.   Good morrow, fair ones. Pray you, if you know,   Where in the purlieus of this forest stands   A sheepcote fenced about with olive trees?        CELIA.   West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom;   The rank of osiers, by the murmuring stream,   Left on your right hand, brings you to the place.   But at this hour the house doth keep itself.   There’s none within.        OLIVER.   If that an eye may profit by a tongue,   Then should I know you by description,   Such garments, and such years. “The boy is fair,   Of female favour, and bestows himself   Like a ripe sister; the woman low,   And browner than her brother.” Are not you   The owner of the house I did inquire for?        CELIA.   It is no boast, being asked, to say we are.        OLIVER.   Orlando doth commend him to you both,   And to that youth he calls his Rosalind   He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?        ROSALIND.   I am. What must we understand by this?        OLIVER.   Some of my shame, if you will know of me   What man I am, and how, and why, and where   This handkerchief was stained.        CELIA.   I pray you tell it.        OLIVER.   When last the young Orlando parted from you,   He left a promise to return again   Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,   Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,   Lo, what befell. He threw his eye aside,   And mark what object did present itself.   Under an oak, whose boughs were mossed with age   And high top bald with dry antiquity,   A wretched ragged man, o’ergrown with hair,   Lay sleeping on his back; about his neck   A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,   Who with her head, nimble in threats, approached   The opening of his mouth. But suddenly,   Seeing Orlando, it unlinked itself   And with indented glides did slip away   Into a bush; under which bush’s shade   A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,   Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch   When that the sleeping man should stir. For ’tis   The royal disposition of that beast   To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.   This seen, Orlando did approach the man   And found it was his brother, his elder brother.        CELIA.   O, I have heard him speak of that same brother,   And he did render him the most unnatural   That lived amongst men.        OLIVER.   And well he might so do,   For well I know he was unnatural.        ROSALIND.   But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,   Food to the sucked and hungry lioness?        OLIVER.   Twice did he turn his back and purposed so;   But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,   And nature, stronger than his just occasion,   Made him give battle to the lioness,   Who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling   From miserable slumber I awaked.        CELIA.   Are you his brother?        ROSALIND.   Was it you he rescued?        CELIA.   Was’t you that did so oft contrive to kill him?        OLIVER.   ’Twas I; but ’tis not I. I do not shame   To tell you what I was, since my conversion   So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.        ROSALIND.   But, for the bloody napkin?        OLIVER.   By and by.   When from the first to last betwixt us two   Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed—   As how I came into that desert place—   In brief, he led me to the gentle Duke,   Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,   Committing me unto my brother’s love,   Who led me instantly unto his cave,   There stripped himself, and here upon his arm   The lioness had torn some flesh away,   Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,   And cried in fainting upon Rosalind.   Brief, I recovered him, bound up his wound,   And after some small space, being strong at heart,   He sent me hither, stranger as I am,   To tell this story, that you might excuse   His broken promise, and to give this napkin,   Dyed in his blood, unto the shepherd youth   That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.      [  Rosalind  faints. ]      CELIA.   Why, how now, Ganymede, sweet Ganymede!        OLIVER.   Many will swoon when they do look on blood.        CELIA.   There is more in it. Cousin—Ganymede!        OLIVER.   Look, he recovers.        ROSALIND.   I would I were at home.        CELIA.   We’ll lead you thither.   I pray you, will you take him by the arm?        OLIVER.   Be of good cheer, youth. You a man? You lack a man’s heart.        ROSALIND.   I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would think this was well  counterfeited. I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho.        OLIVER.   This was not counterfeit. There is too great testimony in your complexion that  it was a passion of earnest.        ROSALIND.   Counterfeit, I assure you.        OLIVER.   Well then, take a good heart, and counterfeit to be a man.        ROSALIND.   So I do. But, i’ faith, I should have been a woman by right.        CELIA.   Come, you look paler and paler. Pray you draw homewards. Good sir, go with us.        OLIVER.   That will I, for I must bear answer back   How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.        ROSALIND.   I shall devise something. But I pray you commend my counterfeiting to him. Will  you go?      [ Exeunt. ]               ACT V       SCENE I. The Forest of Arden       Enter  Touchstone  and   Audrey .        TOUCHSTONE.   We shall find a time, Audrey; patience, gentle Audrey.        AUDREY.   Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old gentleman’s saying.        TOUCHSTONE.   A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile Martext. But Audrey, there is a  youth here in the forest lays claim to you.        AUDREY.   Ay, I know who ’tis. He hath no interest in me in the world.      Enter  William .      Here comes the man you mean.        TOUCHSTONE.   It is meat and drink to me to see a clown. By my troth, we that have good wits  have much to answer for. We shall be flouting; we cannot hold.        WILLIAM.   Good ev’n, Audrey.        AUDREY.   God ye good ev’n, William.        WILLIAM.   And good ev’n to you, sir.        TOUCHSTONE.   Good ev’n, gentle friend. Cover thy head, cover thy head. Nay, prithee, be  covered. How old are you, friend?        WILLIAM.   Five-and-twenty, sir.        TOUCHSTONE.   A ripe age. Is thy name William?        WILLIAM.   William, sir.        TOUCHSTONE.   A fair name. Wast born i’ th’ forest here?        WILLIAM.   Ay, sir, I thank God.        TOUCHSTONE.   “Thank God.” A good answer. Art rich?        WILLIAM.   Faith, sir, so-so.        TOUCHSTONE.   “So-so” is good, very good, very excellent good. And yet it is not, it is but  so-so. Art thou wise?        WILLIAM.   Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.        TOUCHSTONE.   Why, thou sayst well. I do now remember a saying: “The fool doth think he is  wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.” The heathen philosopher,  when he had a desire to eat a grape, would open his lips when he put it into  his mouth, meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and lips to open. You  do love this maid?        WILLIAM.   I do, sir.        TOUCHSTONE.   Give me your hand. Art thou learned?        WILLIAM.   No, sir.        TOUCHSTONE.   Then learn this of me: to have is to have. For it is a figure in rhetoric that  drink, being poured out of cup into a glass, by filling the one doth empty the  other. For all your writers do consent that  ipse  is “he.” Now, you are  not  ipse , for I am he.        WILLIAM.   Which he, sir?        TOUCHSTONE.   He, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you clown, abandon—which is in  the vulgar, “leave”—the society—which in the boorish is “company”—of this  female—which in the common is “woman”; which together is, abandon the society of  this female, or, clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better understanding, diest;  or, to wit, I kill thee, make thee away, translate thy life into death, thy  liberty into bondage. I will deal in poison with thee, or in bastinado, or in  steel. I will bandy with thee in faction; will o’errun thee with policy. I  will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways! Therefore tremble and depart.        AUDREY.   Do, good William.        WILLIAM.   God rest you merry, sir.      [ Exit. ]    Enter  Corin .      CORIN.   Our master and mistress seek you. Come away, away.        TOUCHSTONE.   Trip, Audrey, trip, Audrey! I attend, I attend.      [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE II. Another part of the Forest       Enter  Orlando  and   Oliver .        ORLANDO.   Is’t possible that on so little acquaintance you should like her? That but  seeing, you should love her? And loving woo? And wooing, she should grant? And  will you persever to enjoy her?        OLIVER.   Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the poverty of her, the small  acquaintance, my sudden wooing, nor her sudden consenting. But say with me, I  love Aliena; say with her that she loves me; consent with both that we may  enjoy each other. It shall be to your good, for my father’s house and all the  revenue that was old Sir Rowland’s will I estate upon you, and here live and  die a shepherd.      Enter  Rosalind .      ORLANDO.   You have my consent. Let your wedding be tomorrow. Thither will I invite the  Duke and all’s contented followers. Go you and prepare Aliena; for, look you,  here comes my Rosalind.        ROSALIND.   God save you, brother.        OLIVER.   And you, fair sister.      [ Exit. ]      ROSALIND.   O my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf!        ORLANDO.   It is my arm.        ROSALIND.   I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion.        ORLANDO.   Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.        ROSALIND.   Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swoon when he showed me your  handkercher?        ORLANDO.   Ay, and greater wonders than that.        ROSALIND.   O, I know where you are. Nay, ’tis true. There was never anything so sudden but  the fight of two rams, and Caesar’s thrasonical brag of “I came, saw and  overcame.” For your brother and my sister no sooner met but they looked; no  sooner looked but they loved; no sooner loved but they sighed; no sooner  sighed but they asked one another the reason; no sooner knew the reason but  they sought the remedy; and in these degrees have they made pair of stairs to  marriage, which they will climb incontinent, or else be incontinent before  marriage. They are in the very wrath of love, and they will together. Clubs  cannot part them.        ORLANDO.   They shall be married tomorrow, and I will bid the Duke to the nuptial. But O,  how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man’s eyes! By  so much the more shall I tomorrow be at the height of heart-heaviness, by how  much I shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.        ROSALIND.   Why, then, tomorrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?        ORLANDO.   I can live no longer by thinking.        ROSALIND.   I will weary you then no longer with idle talking. Know of me then—for now I  speak to some purpose—that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit. I speak  not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomuch I say I  know you are. Neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in some little  measure draw a belief from you, to do yourself good, and not to grace me.  Believe then, if you please, that I can do strange things. I have, since I was  three year old, conversed with a magician, most profound in his art and yet not  damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it  out, when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her. I know into what  straits of fortune she is driven and it is not impossible to me, if it appear  not inconvenient to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow, human as she is,  and without any danger.        ORLANDO.   Speak’st thou in sober meanings?        ROSALIND.   By my life, I do, which I tender dearly, though I say I am a magician.  Therefore put you in your best array, bid your friends; for if you will be  married tomorrow, you shall, and to Rosalind, if you will.        Enter  Silvius  and   Phoebe .        Look, here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers.        PHOEBE.   Youth, you have done me much ungentleness   To show the letter that I writ to you.        ROSALIND.   I care not if I have; it is my study   To seem despiteful and ungentle to you.   You are there followed by a faithful shepherd.   Look upon him, love him; he worships you.        PHOEBE.   Good shepherd, tell this youth what ’tis to love.        SILVIUS.   It is to be all made of sighs and tears,   And so am I for Phoebe.        PHOEBE.   And I for Ganymede.        ORLANDO.   And I for Rosalind.        ROSALIND.   And I for no woman.        SILVIUS.   It is to be all made of faith and service,   And so am I for Phoebe.        PHOEBE.   And I for Ganymede.        ORLANDO.   And I for Rosalind.        ROSALIND.   And I for no woman.        SILVIUS.   It is to be all made of fantasy,   All made of passion, and all made of wishes,   All adoration, duty, and observance,   All humbleness, all patience, and impatience,   All purity, all trial, all observance,   And so am I for Phoebe.        PHOEBE.   And so am I for Ganymede.        ORLANDO.   And so am I for Rosalind.        ROSALIND.   And so am I for no woman.        PHOEBE.   [ To Rosalind .] If this be so, why blame you me to love you?        SILVIUS.   [ To Phoebe .] If this be so, why blame you me to love you?        ORLANDO.   If this be so, why blame you me to love you?        ROSALIND.   Why do you speak too, “Why blame you me to love you?”        ORLANDO.   To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.        ROSALIND.   Pray you, no more of this, ’tis like the howling of Irish wolves against the  moon.   [ to Silvius .] I will help you if I can.   [ to Phoebe .] I would love you if I could.—Tomorrow meet me all  together.   [ to Phoebe .] I will marry you, if ever I marry woman, and I’ll be  married tomorrow.   [ to Orlando .] I will satisfy you if ever I satisfied man, and you shall  be married tomorrow.   [ to Silvius .] I will content you, if what pleases you contents you, and  you shall be married tomorrow.   [ to Orlando .] As you love Rosalind, meet.   [ to Silvius .] As you love Phoebe, meet.—And as I love no woman, I’ll  meet. So fare you well. I have left you commands.        SILVIUS.   I’ll not fail, if I live.        PHOEBE.   Nor I.        ORLANDO.   Nor I.      [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE III. Another part of the Forest       Enter  Touchstone  and   Audrey .        TOUCHSTONE.   Tomorrow is the joyful day, Audrey, tomorrow will we be married.        AUDREY.   I do desire it with all my heart; and I hope it is no dishonest desire to  desire to be a woman of the world.      Enter two  Pages .      Here come two of the banished Duke’s pages.        FIRST PAGE.   Well met, honest gentleman.        TOUCHSTONE.   By my troth, well met. Come sit, sit, and a song.        SECOND PAGE.   We are for you, sit i’ th’ middle.        FIRST PAGE.   Shall we clap into’t roundly, without hawking or spitting or saying we are  hoarse, which are the only prologues to a bad voice?        SECOND PAGE.   I’faith, i’faith, and both in a tune like two gipsies on a horse.        \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0SONG        PAGES.

TOUCHSTONE   Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great matter in the ditty, yet the  note was very untuneable.        FIRST PAGE.   You are deceived, sir, we kept time, we lost not our time.        TOUCHSTONE.   By my troth, yes. I count it but time lost to hear such a foolish song. God be  wi’ you, and God mend your voices. Come, Audrey.      [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE IV. Another part of the Forest       Enter  Duke Senior, Amiens, Jaques, Orlando, Oliver   and  Celia .        DUKE SENIOR.   Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy   Can do all this that he hath promised?        ORLANDO.   I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not,   As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.        Enter  Rosalind, Silvius  and   Phoebe .        ROSALIND.   Patience once more whiles our compact is urged.   [ To the Duke. ] You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,   You will bestow her on Orlando here?        DUKE SENIOR.   That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.        ROSALIND.   [ To Orlando .] And you say you will have her when I bring her?        ORLANDO.   That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.        ROSALIND.   [ To Phoebe .] You say you’ll marry me if I be willing?        PHOEBE.   That will I, should I die the hour after.        ROSALIND.   But if you do refuse to marry me,   You’ll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?        PHOEBE.   So is the bargain.        ROSALIND.   [ To Silvius .] You say that you’ll have Phoebe if she will?        SILVIUS.   Though to have her and death were both one thing.        ROSALIND.   I have promised to make all this matter even.   Keep you your word, O Duke, to give your daughter,   You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter.   Keep your word, Phoebe, that you’ll marry me,   Or else, refusing me, to wed this shepherd.   Keep your word, Silvius, that you’ll marry her   If she refuse me. And from hence I go   To make these doubts all even.        [ Exeunt  Rosalind  and   Celia . ]        DUKE SENIOR.   I do remember in this shepherd boy   Some lively touches of my daughter’s favour.        ORLANDO.   My lord, the first time that I ever saw him   Methought he was a brother to your daughter.   But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born   And hath been tutored in the rudiments   Of many desperate studies by his uncle,   Whom he reports to be a great magician,   Obscured in the circle of this forest.        Enter  Touchstone  and   Audrey .        JAQUES.   There is sure another flood toward, and these couples are coming to the ark.  Here comes a pair of very strange beasts, which in all tongues are called fools.        TOUCHSTONE.   Salutation and greeting to you all.        JAQUES.   Good my lord, bid him welcome. This is the motley-minded gentleman that I have  so often met in the forest. He hath been a courtier, he swears.        TOUCHSTONE.   If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation. I have trod a measure; I  have flattered a lady; I have been politic with my friend, smooth with mine  enemy; I have undone three tailors; I have had four quarrels, and like to have  fought one.        JAQUES.   And how was that ta’en up?        TOUCHSTONE.   Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause.        JAQUES.   How seventh cause?—Good my lord, like this fellow?        DUKE SENIOR.   I like him very well.        TOUCHSTONE.   God ’ild you, sir, I desire you of the like. I press in here, sir, amongst the  rest of the country copulatives, to swear and to forswear according as  marriage binds and blood breaks. A poor virgin, sir, an ill-favoured thing,  sir, but mine own; a poor humour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else  will. Rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house, as your pearl in  your foul oyster.        DUKE SENIOR.   By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.        TOUCHSTONE.   According to the fool’s bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.        JAQUES.   But, for the seventh cause. How did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause?        TOUCHSTONE.   Upon a lie seven times removed—bear your body more seeming, Audrey—as thus,  sir. I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier’s beard. He sent me word if I  said his beard was not cut well, he was in the mind it was. This is called the  “retort courteous”. If I sent him word again it was not well cut, he would send  me word he cut it to please himself. This is called the “quip modest”. If again  it was not well cut, he disabled my judgement. This is called the “reply  churlish”. If again it was not well cut, he would answer I spake not true. This  is called the “reproof valiant”. If again it was not well cut, he would say I  lie. This is called the “countercheck quarrelsome”, and so, to the “lie  circumstantial”, and the “lie direct”.        JAQUES.   And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?        TOUCHSTONE.   I durst go no further than the lie circumstantial, nor he durst not give me the  lie direct; and so we measured swords and parted.        JAQUES.   Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?        TOUCHSTONE.   O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book, as you have books for good manners. I  will name you the degrees: the first, the retort courteous; the second, the  quip modest; the third, the reply churlish; the fourth, the reproof valiant;  the fifth, the countercheck quarrelsome; the sixth, the lie with circumstance;  the seventh, the lie direct. All these you may avoid but the lie direct and  you may avoid that too with an “if”. I knew when seven justices could not take  up a quarrel, but when the parties were met themselves, one of them thought but  of an “if”, as, “if you said so, then I said so;” and they shook hands, and  swore brothers. Your “if” is the only peacemaker; much virtue in “if.”        JAQUES.   Is not this a rare fellow, my lord? He’s as good at anything, and yet a fool.        DUKE SENIOR.   He uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the presentation of that he  shoots his wit.        Enter  Hymen, Rosalind  in woman’s clothes, and   Celia . Still music.        HYMEN.   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Then is there mirth in heaven   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0When earthly things made even   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Atone together.   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Good Duke, receive thy daughter.   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Hymen from heaven brought her,   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Yea, brought her hither,   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0That thou mightst join her hand with his,   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Whose heart within his bosom is.        ROSALIND.   [ To Duke Senior .] To you I give myself, for I am yours.   [ To Orlando .] To you I give myself, for I am yours.        DUKE SENIOR.   If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.        ORLANDO.   If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.        PHOEBE.   If sight and shape be true,   Why then, my love adieu.        ROSALIND.   [ To Duke Senior .] I’ll have no father, if you be not he.   [ To Orlando .] I’ll have no husband, if you be not he.   [ To Phoebe .] Nor ne’er wed woman, if you be not she.        HYMEN.   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Peace, ho! I bar confusion.   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0’Tis I must make conclusion   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Of these most strange events.   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Here’s eight that must take hands   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0To join in Hymen’s bands,   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0If truth holds true contents.   [ To Orlando and Rosalind .] You and you no cross shall part.   [ To Celia and Oliver .] You and you are heart in heart.   [ To Phoebe .] You to his love must accord   Or have a woman to your lord.   [ To Audrey and Touchstone .] You and you are sure together   As the winter to foul weather.   Whiles a wedlock hymn we sing,   Feed yourselves with questioning,   That reason wonder may diminish   How thus we met, and these things finish.         \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0SONG   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Wedding is great Juno’s crown,   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0O blessed bond of board and bed.   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0’Tis Hymen peoples every town,   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0High wedlock then be honoured.   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Honour, high honour, and renown   \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0To Hymen, god of every town.        DUKE SENIOR.   O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me   Even daughter, welcome in no less degree.        PHOEBE.   [ To Silvius .] I will not eat my word, now thou art mine,   Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.      Enter  Jaques de Boys .      JAQUES DE BOYS.   Let me have audience for a word or two.   I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,   That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.   Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day   Men of great worth resorted to this forest,   Addressed a mighty power, which were on foot   In his own conduct, purposely to take   His brother here and put him to the sword;   And to the skirts of this wild wood he came,   Where, meeting with an old religious man,   After some question with him, was converted   Both from his enterprise and from the world,   His crown bequeathing to his banished brother,   And all their lands restored to them again   That were with him exiled. This to be true   I do engage my life.        DUKE SENIOR.   Welcome, young man.   Thou offer’st fairly to thy brother’s wedding:   To one his lands withheld, and to the other   A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.   First, in this forest let us do those ends   That here were well begun and well begot;   And after, every of this happy number   That have endured shrewd days and nights with us   Shall share the good of our returned fortune,   According to the measure of their states.   Meantime, forget this new-fall’n dignity,   And fall into our rustic revelry.   Play, music! And you brides and bridegrooms all,   With measure heaped in joy to th’ measures fall.        JAQUES.   Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,   The Duke hath put on a religious life   And thrown into neglect the pompous court.        JAQUES DE BOYS.   He hath.        JAQUES.   To him will I. Out of these convertites   There is much matter to be heard and learned.   [ To Duke Senior .] You to your former honour I bequeath;   Your patience and your virtue well deserves it.   [ To Orlando .] You to a love that your true faith doth merit.   [ To Oliver .] You to your land, and love, and great allies.   [ To Silvius .] You to a long and well-deserved bed.   [ To Touchstone .] And you to wrangling, for thy loving voyage   Is but for two months victualled.—So to your pleasures,   I am for other than for dancing measures.        DUKE SENIOR.   Stay, Jaques, stay.        JAQUES.   To see no pastime, I. What you would have   I’ll stay to know at your abandoned cave.      [ Exit. ]      DUKE SENIOR.   Proceed, proceed! We will begin these rites,   As we do trust they’ll end, in true delights.      [ Dance. Exeunt all but  Rosalind . ]      EPILOGUE      ROSALIND.   It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue, but it is no more  unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue. If it be true that good wine  needs no bush, ’tis true that a good play needs no epilogue. Yet to good wine  they do use good bushes, and good plays prove the better by the help of good  epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am neither a good epilogue nor  cannot insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play! I am not furnished like  a beggar; therefore to beg will not become me. My way is to conjure you, and  I’ll begin with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love you bear to men,  to like as much of this play as please you. And I charge you, O men, for the  love you bear to women—as I perceive by your simpering, none of you hates  them—that between you and the women the play may please. If I were a woman, I  would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased me, complexions that liked  me, and breaths that I defied not. And I am sure as many as have good beards,  or good faces, or sweet breaths will for my kind offer, when I make curtsy,  bid me farewell.      [ Exit. ]           <a '"

CHARLES    There’s no news at the court, sir, but the old news  That is, the old Duke is  banished by his younger brother the new Duke, and three or four loving lords  have put themselves into voluntary e e with him, whose lands and revenues  enrich the new Duke; therefore he gives them good leave to wander         OLIVER    Can you tell if Rosalind, the Duke’s daughter, be banished with her father?        CHARLES    O, no; for the Duke’s daughter, her cousin, so loves her, being ever from their  cradles bred together, that she would have followed her e e or have died to  stay behind her  She is at the court and no less beloved of her uncle than his  own daughter, and never two ladies loved as they do         OLIVER    Where will the old Duke live?

CHARLES    Marry, do I, sir, and I came to acquaint you with a matter  I am given, sir,  secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition  to come in disguised against me to try a fall  Tomorrow, sir, I wrestle for my  credit, and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well   Your brother is but young and tender, and for your love I would be loath to  foil him, as I must for my own honour if he come in  Therefore, out of my  love to you, I came hither to acquaint you withal, that either you might stay  him from his intendment, or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in  that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will         OLIVER    Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt find I will most  kindly requite  I had myself notice of my brother’s purpose herein, and have by  underhand means laboured to dissuade him from it; but he is resolute  I’ll tell  thee, Charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full of ambition,  an envious emulator of every man’s good parts, a secret and villainous  contriver against me his natural brother  Therefore use thy discretion  I had  as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger  And thou wert best look to’t;  for if thou dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace  himself on thee, he will practise against thee by poison, entrap thee by some  treacherous device, and never leave thee till he hath ta’en thy life by some  indirect means or other  For I assure thee (and almost with tears I speak it)  there is not one so young and so villainous this day living  I speak but  brotherly of him, but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush and  weep, and thou must look pale and wonder         CHARLES    I am heartily glad I came hither to you  If he come tomorrow I’ll give him his  payment  If ever he go alone again I’ll never wrestle for prize more  And so,  God keep your worship         E          OLIVER    Farewell, good Charles  Now will I stir this gamester  I hope I shall see an  end of him; for my soul—yet I know not why—hates nothing more than he  Yet  he’s gentle, never schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of all sorts  enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much in the heart of the world, and  especially of my own people, who best know him, that I am altogether misprized   But it shall not be so long; this wrestler shall clear all  Nothing remains but  that I kindle the boy thither, which now I’ll go about         E            SCENE II  A Lawn before the Duke’s Palace       Enter  Rosalind  and   Celia          CELIA    I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry         ROSALIND    Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of, and would you yet I were  merrier? Unless you could teach me to forget a banished father, you must not  learn me how to remember any e aordinary pleasure         CELIA    Herein I see thou lov’st me not with the full weight that I love thee  If my  uncle, thy banished father, had banished thy uncle, the Duke my father, so thou  hadst been still with me, I could have taught my love to take thy father for  mine  So wouldst thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously  tempered as mine is to thee         ROSALIND    Well, I will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours         CELIA    You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is like to have; and truly,  when he dies thou shalt be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy  father perforce, I will render thee again in affection  By mine honour I will!  And when I break that oath, let me turn monster  Therefore, my sweet Rose, my  dear Rose, be merry         ROSALIND    From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports  Let me see—what think you of  falling in love?        CELIA    Marry, I prithee do, to make sport withal; but love no man in good earnest,  nor no further in sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in  honour come off again         ROSALIND    What shall be our sport, then?        CELIA    Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her wheel, that her gifts  may henceforth be bestowed equally         ROSALIND    I would we could do so, for her benefits are mightily misplaced, and the  bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women         CELIA    ’Tis true, for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest, and those  that she makes honest she makes very ill-favouredly         ROSALIND    Nay, now thou goest from Fortune’s office to Nature’s  Fortune reigns in gifts  of the world, not in the lineaments of Nature       Enter  Touchstone        CELIA    No? When Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by Fortune fall into the  fire? Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune  sent in this fool to cut off the argument?        ROSALIND    Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when Fortune makes Nature’s  natural the cutter-off of Nature’s wit         CELIA    Peradventure this is not Fortune’s work neither, but Nature’s, who perceiveth  our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses, and hath sent this  natural for our whetstone; for always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone  of the wits —How now, wit, whither wander you?        TOUCHSTONE    Mistress, you must come away to your father         CELIA    Were you made the messenger?        TOUCHSTONE    No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you         ROSALIND    Where learned you that oath, fool?        TOUCHSTONE    Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were good pancakes, and swore  by his honour the mustard was naught  Now, I’ll stand to it, the pancakes were  naught and the mustard was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn         CELIA    How prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge?        ROSALIND    Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom         TOUCHSTONE    Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and swear by your beards that I am  a knave         CELIA    By our beards, if we had them, thou art         TOUCHSTONE    By my knavery, if I had it, then I were  But if you swear by that that is not,  you are not forsworn  No more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he  never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those  pancackes or that mustard         CELIA    Prithee, who is’t that thou mean’st?        TOUCHSTONE    One that old Frederick, your father, loves         CELIA    My father’s love is enough to honour him  Enough! Speak no more of him  You’ll  be whipped for ta ion one of these days         TOUCHSTONE    The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly         CELIA    By my troth, thou sayest true  For since the little wit that fools have was  silenced, the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show  Here comes  Monsieur Le Beau       Enter  Le Beau        ROSALIND    With his mouth full of news         CELIA    Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young         ROSALIND    Then shall we be news-crammed         CELIA    All the better; we shall be the more marketable     Bonjour , Monsieur Le Beau  What’s the news?        LE BEAU    Fair princess, you have lost much good sport         CELIA    Sport! Of what colour?        LE BEAU    What colour, madam? How shall I answer you?        ROSALIND    As wit and fortune will         TOUCHSTONE    Or as the destinies decrees         CELIA    Well said  That was laid on with a trowel         TOUCHSTONE    Nay, if I keep not my rank—        ROSALIND    Thou losest thy old smell         LE BEAU    You amaze me, ladies  I would have told you of good wrestling, which you have  lost the sight of         ROSALIND    Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling         LE BEAU    I will tell you the beginning and, if it please your ladyships, you may see  the end, for the best is yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming to  perform it         CELIA    Well, the beginning that is dead and buried         LE BEAU    There comes an old man and his three sons—        CELIA    I could match this beginning with an old tale         LE BEAU    Three proper young men of e llent growth and presence         ROSALIND    With bills on their necks: “Be it known unto all men by these presents ”        LE BEAU    The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the Duke’s wrestler, which  Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs, that there is  little hope of life in him  So he served the second, and so the third  Yonder  they lie, the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them  that all the beholders take his part with weeping         ROSALIND    Alas!        TOUCHSTONE    But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have lost?        LE BEAU    Why, this that I speak of         TOUCHSTONE    Thus men may grow wiser every day  It is the first time that ever I heard  breaking of ribs was sport for ladies         CELIA    Or I, I promise thee         ROSALIND    But is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides? Is there yet  another dotes upon rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?        LE BEAU    You must if you stay here, for here is the place appointed for the wrestling,  and they are ready to perform it         CELIA    Yonder, sure, they are coming  Let us now stay and see it       Flourish  Enter  Duke Frederick,  Lords, Orlando, Charles  and Attendants       DUKE FREDERICK    Come on  Since the youth will not be entreated, his own peril on his  forwardness         ROSALIND    Is yonder the man?        LE BEAU    Even he, madam         CELIA    Alas, he is too young  Yet he looks successfully         DUKE FREDERICK    How now, daughter and cousin? Are you crept hither to see the wrestling?        ROSALIND    Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave         DUKE FREDERICK    You will take little delight in it, I can tell you, there is such odds in the  man  In pity of the challenger’s youth I would fain dissuade him, but he will  not be entreated  Speak to him, ladies; see if you can move him         CELIA    Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau         DUKE FREDERICK    Do so; I’ll not be by          Duke Frederick  steps  aside         LE BEAU    Monsieur the challenger, the Princess calls for you         ORLANDO    I attend them with all respect and duty         ROSALIND    Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?        ORLANDO    No, fair princess  He is the general challenger  I come but in as others do,  to try with him the strength of my youth         CELIA    Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years  You have seen cruel  proof of this man’s strength  If you saw yourself with your eyes or knew  yourself with your judgement, the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a  more equal enterprise  We pray you for your own sake to embrace your own  safety and give over this attempt         ROSALIND    Do, young sir  Your reputation shall not therefore be misprized  We will make  it our suit to the Duke that the wrestling might not go forward         ORLANDO    I beseech you, punish me not with your hard thoughts, wherein I confess me much  guilty to deny so fair and e llent ladies anything  But let your fair eyes  and gentle wishes go with me to my trial, wherein if I be foiled there is but  one shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one dead that is willing to  be so  I shall do my friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me; the world  no injury, for in it I have nothing  Only in the world I fill up a place, which  may be better supplied when I have made it empty         ROSALIND    The little strength that I have, I would it were with you         CELIA    And mine to eke out hers         ROSALIND    Fare you well  Pray heaven I be deceived in you         CELIA    Your heart’s desires be with you         CHARLES    Come, where is this young gallant that is so desirous to lie with his mother  earth?        ORLANDO    Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working         DUKE FREDERICK    You shall try but one fall         CHARLES    No, I warrant your grace you shall not entreat him to a second, that have so  mightily persuaded him from a first         ORLANDO    You mean to mock me after; you should not have mocked me before  But come your  ways         ROSALIND    Now, Hercules be thy speed, young man!

LE BEAU    He cannot speak, my lord         DUKE FREDERICK    Bear him away          Charles  is carried off by Attendants         What is thy name, young man?        ORLANDO    Orlando, my liege, the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys         DUKE FREDERICK    I would thou hadst been son to some man else    The world esteemed thy father honourable,   But I did find him still mine enemy    Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed   Hadst thou descended from another house    But fare thee well, thou art a gallant youth    I would thou hadst told me of another father           E nt  Duke Frederick, Le Beau  and  Lords           CELIA    Were I my father, coz, would I do this?        ORLANDO    I am more proud to be Sir Rowland’s son,   His youngest son, and would not change that calling   To be adopted heir to Frederick         ROSALIND    My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,   And all the world was of my father’s mind    Had I before known this young man his son,   I should have given him tears unto entreaties   Ere he should thus have ventured         CELIA    Gentle cousin,   Let us go thank him and encourage him    My father’s rough and envious disposition   Sticks me at heart —Sir, you have well deserved    If you do keep your promises in love   But justly, as you have e eded promise,   Your mistress shall be happy         ROSALIND    Gentleman,        Giving him a chain from her neck         Wear this for me—one out of suits with Fortune,   That could give more but that her hand lacks means —   Shall we go, coz?        CELIA    Ay —Fare you well, fair gentleman         ORLANDO    Can I not say, I thank you? My better parts   Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up   Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block         ROSALIND    He calls us back  My pride fell with my fortunes    I’ll ask him what he would —Did you call, sir?—   Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown   More than your enemies         CELIA    Will you go, coz?        ROSALIND    Have with you —Fare you well           E nt  Rosalind  and   Celia            ORLANDO    What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?   I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference    O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown    Or Charles or something weaker masters thee       Enter  Le Beau        LE BEAU    Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you   To leave this place  Albeit you have deserved   High commendation, true applause, and love,   Yet such is now the Duke’s condition   That he misconsters all that you have done    The Duke is humorous; what he is indeed   More suits you to conceive than I to speak of         ORLANDO    I thank you, sir; and pray you tell me this:   Which of the two was daughter of the Duke   That here was at the wrestling?        LE BEAU    Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners,   But yet indeed the smaller is his daughter    The other is daughter to the banished Duke,   And here detained by her usurping uncle   To keep his daughter company, whose loves   Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters    But I can tell you that of late this Duke   Hath ta’en displeasure ’gainst his gentle niece,   Grounded upon no other argument   But that the people praise her for her virtues   And pity her for her good father’s sake;   And, on my life, his malice ’gainst the lady   Will suddenly break forth  Sir, fare you well    Hereafter, in a better world than this,   I shall desire more love and knowledge of you         ORLANDO    I rest much bounden to you; fare you well!        E   Le Beau          Thus must I from the smoke into the smother,   From tyrant Duke unto a tyrant brother    But heavenly Rosalind!        E            SCENE III  A Room in the Palace       Enter  Celia  and   Rosalind          CELIA    Why, cousin, why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! Not a word?        ROSALIND    Not one to throw at a dog         CELIA    No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs  Throw some of them at  me  Come, lame me with reasons         ROSALIND    Then there were two cousins laid up, when the one should be lamed with reasons  and the other mad without any         CELIA    But is all this for your father?        ROSALIND    No, some of it is for my child’s father  O, how full of briers is this  working-day world!        CELIA    They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in holiday foolery  If we walk not  in the trodden paths, our very petticoats will catch them         ROSALIND    I could shake them off my coat; these burs are in my heart         CELIA    Hem them away         ROSALIND    I would try, if I could cry “hem” and have him         CELIA    Come, come, wrestle with thy affections         ROSALIND    O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself         CELIA    O, a good wish upon you! You will try in time, in despite of a fall  But  turning these jests out of service, let us talk in good earnest  Is it  possible on such a sudden you should fall into so strong a liking with old  Sir Rowland’s youngest son?        ROSALIND    The Duke my father loved his father dearly         CELIA    Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly? By this kind of  chase I should hate him, for my father hated his father dearly; yet I hate not  Orlando         ROSALIND    No, faith, hate him not, for my sake         CELIA    Why should I not? Doth he not deserve well?      Enter  Duke Frederick  with Lords       ROSALIND    Let me love him for that, and do you love him because I do —Look, here comes  the Duke         CELIA    With his eyes full of anger         DUKE FREDERICK    Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste,   And get you from our court         ROSALIND    Me, uncle?        DUKE FREDERICK    You, cousin    Within these ten days if that thou be’st found   So near our public court as twenty miles,   Thou diest for it         ROSALIND    I do beseech your Grace,   Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me    If with myself I hold intelligence,   Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,   If that I do not dream, or be not frantic—   As I do trust I am not—then, dear uncle,   Never so much as in a thought unborn   Did I offend your Highness         DUKE FREDERICK    Thus do all traitors    If their purgation did consist in words,   They are as innocent as grace itself    Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not         ROSALIND    Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor    Tell me whereon the likelihood depends         DUKE FREDERICK    Thou art thy father’s daughter, there’s enough         ROSALIND    So was I when your highness took his dukedom;   So was I when your highness banished him    Treason is not inherited, my lord,   Or, if we did derive it from our friends,   What’s that to me? My father was no traitor    Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much   To think my poverty is treacherous         CELIA    Dear sovereign, hear me speak         DUKE FREDERICK    Ay, Celia, we stayed her for your sake,   Else had she with her father ranged along         CELIA    I did not then entreat to have her stay;   It was your pleasure and your own remorse    I was too young that time to value her,   But now I know her  If she be a traitor,   Why, so am I  We still have slept together,   Rose at an instant, learned, played, ate together,   And wheresoe’er we went, like Juno’s swans,   Still we went coupled and inseparable         DUKE FREDERICK    She is too subtle for thee, and her smoothness,   Her very silence, and her patience   Speak to the people, and they pity her    Thou art a fool  She robs thee of thy name,   And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous   When she is gone  Then open not thy lips    Firm and irrevocable is my doom   Which I have passed upon her  She is banished         CELIA    Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege    I cannot live out of her company         DUKE FREDERICK    You are a fool  You, niece, provide yourself    If you outstay the time, upon mine honour   And in the greatness of my word, you die         E nt  Duke Frederick   and Lords         CELIA    O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?   Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine    I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am         ROSALIND    I have more cause         CELIA    Thou hast not, cousin    Prithee be cheerful  Know’st thou not the Duke   Hath banished me, his daughter?        ROSALIND    That he hath not         CELIA    No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love   Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one    Shall we be sundered? Shall we part, sweet girl?   No, let my father seek another heir    Therefore devise with me how we may fly,   Whither to go, and what to bear with us,   And do not seek to take your change upon you,   To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out    For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,   Say what thou canst, I’ll go along with thee         ROSALIND    Why, whither shall we go?        CELIA    To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden         ROSALIND    Alas, what danger will it be to us,   Maids as we are, to travel forth so far?   Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold         CELIA    I’ll put myself in poor and mean attire,   And with a kind of umber smirch my face    The like do you; so shall we pass along   And never stir assailants         ROSALIND    Were it not better,   Because that I am more than common tall,   That I did suit me all points like a man?   A gallant curtal-a upon my thigh,   A boar-spear in my hand, and in my heart   Lie there what hidden woman’s fear there will,   We’ll have a swashing and a martial outside,   As many other mannish cowards have   That do outface it with their semblances         CELIA    What shall I call thee when thou art a man?        ROSALIND    I’ll have no worse a name than Jove’s own page,   And therefore look you call me Ganymede    But what will you be called?        CELIA    Something that hath a reference to my state:   No longer Celia, but Aliena         ROSALIND    But, cousin, what if we assayed to steal   The clownish fool out of your father’s court?   Would he not be a comfort to our travel?        CELIA    He’ll go along o’er the wide world with me    Leave me alone to woo him  Let’s away,   And get our jewels and our wealth together,   Devise the fittest time and safest way   To hide us from pursuit that will be made   After my flight  Now go we in content   To liberty, and not to banishment         E nt                  ACT II       SCENE I  The Forest of Arden     Enter  Duke Senior, Amiens   and two or three Lords, dressed as foresters       DUKE SENIOR    Now, my co-mates and brothers in e e,   Hath not old custom made this life more sweet   Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods   More free from peril than the envious court?   Here feel we not the penalty of Adam,   The seasons’ difference, as the icy fang   And churlish chiding of the winter’s wind,   Which when it bites and blows upon my body   Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say:   “This is no flattery  These are counsellors   That feelingly persuade me what I am ”   Sweet are the uses of adversity,   Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,   Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;   And this our life, e pt from public haunt,   Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,   Sermons in stones, and good in everything         AMIENS    I would not change it  Happy is your grace,   That can translate the stubbornness of fortune   Into so quiet and so sweet a style         DUKE SENIOR    Come, shall we go and kill us venison?   And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,   Being native burghers of this desert city,   Should in their own confines with forked heads   Have their round haunches gored         FIRST LORD    Indeed, my lord,   The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,   And in that kind swears you do more usurp   Than doth your brother that hath banished you    Today my lord of Amiens and myself   Did steal behind him as he lay along   Under an oak, whose antique root peeps out   Upon the brook that brawls along this wood;   To the which place a poor sequestered stag,   That from the hunter’s aim had ta’en a hurt,   Did come to languish; and indeed, my lord,   The wretched animal heaved forth such groans   That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat   Almost to bursting, and the big round tears   Coursed one another down his innocent nose   In piteous chase  And thus the hairy fool,   Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,   Stood on th’ e emest verge of the swift brook,   Augmenting it with tears         DUKE SENIOR    But what said Jaques?   Did he not moralize this spectacle?        FIRST LORD    O yes, into a thousand similes    First, for his weeping into the needless stream:   “Poor deer,” quoth he “thou mak’st a testament   As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more   To that which had too much ” Then, being there alone,   Left and abandoned of his velvet friends:   “’Tis right”; quoth he, “thus misery doth part   The flu f company ” Anon a careless herd,   Full of the pasture, jumps along by him   And never stays to greet him  “Ay,” quoth Jaques,   “Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens!   ’Tis just the fashion  Wherefore do you look   Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?”   Thus most invectively he pierceth through   The body of the country, city, court,   Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we   Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what’s worse,   To fright the animals and to kill them up   In their assigned and native dwelling-place         DUKE SENIOR    And did you leave him in this contemplation?        SECOND LORD    We did, my lord, weeping and commenting   Upon the sobbing deer         DUKE SENIOR    Show me the place    I love to cope him in these sullen fits,   For then he’s full of matter         FIRST LORD    I’ll bring you to him straight         E nt           SCENE II  A Room in the Palace     Enter  Duke Frederick  with  Lords       DUKE FREDERICK    Can it be possible that no man saw them?   It cannot be! Some villains of my court   Are of consent and sufferance in this         FIRST LORD    I cannot hear of any that did see her    The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,   Saw her abed, and in the morning early   They found the bed untreasured of their mistress         SECOND LORD    My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft   Your grace was wont to laugh, is also missing    Hesperia, the princess’ gentlewoman,   Confesses that she secretly o’erheard   Your daughter and her cousin much commend   The parts and graces of the wrestler   That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;   And she believes wherever they are gone   That youth is surely in their company         DUKE FREDERICK    Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither    If he be absent, bring his brother to me    I’ll make him find him  Do this suddenly!   And let not search and inquisition quail   To bring again these foolish runaways         E nt           SCENE III  Before Oliver’s House       Enter  Orlando  and   Adam , meeting         ORLANDO    Who’s there?        ADAM    What, my young master? O my gentle master,   O my sweet master, O you memory   Of old Sir Rowland! Why, what make you here?   Why are you virtuous? Why do people love you?   And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant?   Why would you be so fond to overcome   The bonny prizer of the humorous Duke?   Your praise is come too swiftly home before you    Know you not, master, to some kind of men   Their graces serve them but as enemies?   No more do yours  Your virtues, gentle master,   Are sanctified and holy traitors to you    O, what a world is this, when what is comely   Envenoms him that bears it!        ORLANDO    Why, what’s the matter?        ADAM    O unhappy youth,   Come not within these doors! Within this roof   The enemy of all your graces lives    Your brother—no, no brother, yet the son—   Yet not the son; I will not call him son—   Of him I was about to call his father,   Hath heard your praises, and this night he means   To burn the lodging where you use to lie,   And you within it  If he fail of that,   He will have other means to cut you off;   I overheard him and his practices    This is no place; this house is but a butchery    Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it         ORLANDO    Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?        ADAM    No matter whither, so you come not here         ORLANDO    What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food,   Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce   A thievish living on the common road?   This I must do, or know not what to do    Yet this I will not do, do how I can    I rather will subject me to the malice   Of a diverted blood and bloody brother         ADAM    But do not so  I have five hundred crowns,   The thrifty hire I saved under your father,   Which I did store to be my foster-nurse,   When service should in my old limbs lie lame,   And unregarded age in corners thrown    Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,   Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,   Be comfort to my age  Here is the gold    All this I give you  Let me be your servant    Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty,   For in my youth I never did apply   Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,   Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo   The means of weakness and debility    Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,   Frosty but kindly  Let me go with you    I’ll do the service of a younger man   In all your business and necessities         ORLANDO    O good old man, how well in thee appears   The constant service of the antique world,   When service sweat for duty, not for meed    Thou art not for the fashion of these times,   Where none will sweat but for promotion,   And having that do choke their service up   Even with the having  It is not so with thee    But, poor old man, thou prun’st a rotten tree,   That cannot so much as a blossom yield   In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry    But come thy ways, we’ll go along together,   And ere we have thy youthful wages spent   We’ll light upon some settled low content         ADAM    Master, go on and I will follow thee   To the last gasp with truth and loyalty    From seventeen years till now almost fourscore   Here lived I, but now live here no more    At seventeen years many their fortunes seek,   But at fourscore it is too late a week    Yet fortune cannot recompense me better   Than to die well and not my master’s debtor         E nt           SCENE IV  The Forest of Arden       Enter  Rosalind  as Ganymede,   Celia  as Aliena, and   Touchstone          ROSALIND    O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!        TOUCHSTONE    I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary         ROSALIND    I could find in my heart to disgrace my man’s apparel, and to cry like a woman,  but I must comfort the weaker vessel, as doublet and hose ought to show itself  courageous to petticoat  Therefore, courage, good Aliena         CELIA    I pray you bear with me, I cannot go no further         TOUCHSTONE    For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear you  Yet I should bear no  cross if I did bear you, for I think you have no money in your purse         ROSALIND    Well, this is the forest of Arden         TOUCHSTONE    Ay, now am I in Arden, the more fool I!

CORIN    I partly guess, for I have loved ere now         SILVIUS    No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,   Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover   As ever sighed upon a midnight pillow    But if thy love were ever like to mine—   As sure I think did never man love so—   How many actions most ridiculous   Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?        CORIN    Into a thousand that I have forgotten         SILVIUS    O, thou didst then never love so heartily!   If thou rememb’rest not the slightest folly   That ever love did make thee run into,   Thou hast not loved    Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,   Wearing thy hearer in thy mistress’ praise,   Thou hast not loved    Or if thou hast not broke from company   Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,   Thou hast not loved    O Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe!        E   Silvius          ROSALIND    Alas, poor shepherd, searching of thy wound,   I have by hard adventure found mine own         TOUCHSTONE    And I mine  I remember when I was in love I broke my sword upon a stone and  bid him take that for coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I remember the kissing  of her batlet, and the cow’s dugs that her pretty chopped hands had milked; and  I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took two cods,  and, giving her them again, said with weeping tears, “Wear these for my sake ”  We that are true lovers run into strange capers  But as all is mortal in  nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly         ROSALIND    Thou speak’st wiser than thou art ware of         TOUCHSTONE    Nay, I shall ne’er be ware of mine own wit till I break my shins against it         ROSALIND    Jove, Jove, this shepherd’s passion   Is much upon my fashion         TOUCHSTONE    And mine, but it grows something stale with me         CELIA    I pray you, one of you question yond man   If he for gold will give us any food    I faint almost to death         TOUCHSTONE    Holla, you clown!

As I do live by food, I met a fool,   Who laid him down and basked him in the sun,   And railed on Lady Fortune in good terms,   In good set terms, and yet a motley fool    “Good morrow, fool,” quoth I  “No, sir,” quoth he,   “Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune ”   And then he drew a dial from his poke,   And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,   Says very wisely, “It is ten o’clock    Thus we may see,” quoth he, “how the world wags    ’Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,   And after one hour more ’twill be eleven    And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe,   And then from hour to hour we rot and rot,   And thereby hangs a tale ” When I did hear   The motley fool thus moral on the time,   My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,   That fools should be so deep-contemplative,   And I did laugh sans intermission   An hour by his dial  O noble fool!   A worthy fool! Motley’s the only wear         DUKE SENIOR    What fool is this?        JAQUES    O worthy fool!—One that hath been a courtier,   And says if ladies be but young and fair,   They have the gift to know it  And in his brain,   Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit   After a voyage, he hath strange places crammed   With observation, the which he vents   In mangled forms  O that I were a fool!   I am ambitious for a motley coat         DUKE SENIOR    Thou shalt have one         JAQUES    It is my only suit,   Provided that you weed your better judgements   Of all opinion that grows rank in them   That I am wise  I must have liberty   Withal, as large a charter as the wind,   To blow on whom I please, for so fools have    And they that are most galled with my folly,   They most must laugh  And why, sir, must they so?   The “why” is plain as way to parish church    He that a fool doth very wisely hit   Doth very foolishly, although he smart,   Not to seem senseless of the bob  If not,   The wise man’s folly is anatomized   Even by the squandering glances of the fool    Invest me in my motley  Give me leave   To speak my mind, and I will through and through   Cleanse the foul body of th’ infected world,   If they will patiently receive my medicine         DUKE SENIOR    Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do         JAQUES    What, for a counter, would I do but good?        DUKE SENIOR    Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin;   For thou thyself hast been a libertine,   As sensual as the brutish sting itself,   And all th’ embossed sores and headed evils   That thou with license of free foot hast caught   Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world         JAQUES    Why, who cries out on pride   That can therein ta ny private party?   Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea   Till that the weary very means do ebb?   What woman in the city do I name   When that I say the city-woman bears   The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?   Who can come in and say that I mean her,   When such a one as she, such is her neighbour?   Or what is he of basest function   That says his bravery is not on my cost,   Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits   His folly to the mettle of my speech?   There then  How then, what then? Let me see wherein   My tongue hath wronged him  If it do him right,   Then he hath wronged himself  If he be free,   Why then my ta g like a wild-goose flies   Unclaimed of any man  But who comes here?      Enter  Orlando  with sword  drawn       ORLANDO    Forbear, and eat no more         JAQUES    Why, I have eat none yet         ORLANDO    Nor shalt not till necessity be served         JAQUES    Of what kind should this cock come of?        DUKE SENIOR    Art thou thus boldened, man, by thy distress?   Or else a rude despiser of good manners,   That in civility thou seem’st so empty?        ORLANDO    You touched my vein at first  The thorny point   Of bare distress hath ta’en from me the show   Of smooth civility; yet am I inland bred   And know some nurture  But forbear, I say!   He dies that touches any of this fruit   Till I and my affairs are answered         JAQUES    An you will not be answered with reason, I must die         DUKE SENIOR    What would you have? Your gentleness shall force   More than your force move us to gentleness         ORLANDO    I almost die for food, and let me have it         DUKE SENIOR    Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table         ORLANDO    Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you    I thought that all things had been savage here   And therefore put I on the countenance   Of stern commandment  But whate’er you are   That in this desert inaccessible,   Under the shade of melancholy boughs,   Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time,   If ever you have looked on better days,   If ever been where bells have knolled to church,   If ever sat at any good man’s feast,   If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear,   And know what ’tis to pity and be pitied,   Let gentleness my strong enforcement be,   In the which hope I blush and hide my sword         DUKE SENIOR    True is it that we have seen better days,   And have with holy bell been knolled to church,   And sat at good men’s feasts, and wiped our eyes   Of drops that sacred pity hath engendered    And therefore sit you down in gentleness,   And take upon command what help we have   That to your wanting may be ministered         ORLANDO    Then but forbear your food a little while,   Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn,   And give it food  There is an old poor man   Who after me hath many a weary step   Limped in pure love  Till he be first sufficed,   Oppressed with two weak evils, age and hunger,   I will not touch a bit         DUKE SENIOR    Go find him out,   And we will nothing waste till you return         ORLANDO    I thank ye, and be blest for your good comfort         E          DUKE SENIOR    Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy    This wide and universal theatre   Presents more woeful pageants than the scene   Wherein we play in         JAQUES    All the world’s a stage,   And all the men and women merely players;   They have their e s and their entrances,   And one man in his time plays many parts,   His acts being seven ages  At first the infant,   Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms;   Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel   And shining morning face, creeping like snail   Unwillingly to school  And then the lover,   Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad   Made to his mistress’ eyebrow  Then a soldier,   Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,   Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,   Seeking the bubble reputation   Even in the cannon’s mouth  And then the justice,   In fair round belly with good capon lined,   With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,   Full of wise saws and modern instances;   And so he plays his part  The si  age shifts   Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,   With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,   His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide   For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,   Turning again toward childish treble, pipes   And whistles in his sound  Last scene of all,   That ends this strange eventful history,   Is second childishness and mere oblivion,   Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything         Enter  Orlando  bearing   Adam          DUKE SENIOR    Welcome  Set down your venerable burden,   And let him feed         ORLANDO    I thank you most for him         ADAM    So had you need;   I scarce can speak to thank you for myself         DUKE SENIOR    Welcome, fall to  I will not trouble you   As yet to question you about your fortunes    Give us some music, and good cousin, sing         SONG         AMIENS  ( Sings  )           Blow, blow, thou winter wind,           Thou art not so unkind               As man’s ingratitude            Thy tooth is not so keen,           Because thou art not seen,               Although thy breath be rude    Heigh-ho, sing heigh-ho, unto the green holly    Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly            Then, heigh-ho, the holly!               This life is most jolly                  Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,           That dost not bite so nigh               As benefits forgot            Though thou the waters warp,           Thy sting is not so sharp               As friend remembered not    Heigh-ho, sing heigh-ho, unto the green holly    Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly            Then, heigh-ho, the holly!

Sir, sir, that cannot be    But were I not the better part made mercy,   I should not seek an absent argument   Of my revenge, thou present  But look to it:   Find out thy brother wheresoe’er he is    Seek him with candle  Bring him dead or living   Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more   To seek a living in our territory    Thy lands, and all things that thou dost call thine   Worth seizure, do we seize into our hands,   Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother’s mouth   Of what we think against thee         OLIVER    O that your highness knew my heart in this:   I never loved my brother in my life         DUKE FREDERICK    More villain thou  Well, push him out of doors,   And let my officers of such a nature   Make an e nt upon his house and lands    Do this e diently, and turn him going         E nt           SCENE II  The Forest of Arden     Enter  Orlando  with a  paper       ORLANDO    Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love         And thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, survey   With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,        Thy huntress’ name that my full life doth sway    O Rosalind, these trees shall be my books,        And in their barks my thoughts I’ll character,   That every eye which in this forest looks        Shall see thy virtue witnessed everywhere    Run, run, Orlando, carve on every tree   The fair, the chaste, and une essive she         E          Enter  Corin  and   Touchstone          CORIN    And how like you this shepherd’s life, Master Touchstone?        TOUCHSTONE    Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good life; but in respect that  it is a shepherd’s life, it is naught  In respect that it is solitary, I like  it very well; but in respect that it is private, it is a very vile life  Now in  respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect it is not in  the court, it is tedious  As it is a spare life, look you, it fits my humour  well; but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much against my stomach   Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?        CORIN    No more but that I know the more one sickens, the worse at ease he is; and that  he that wants money, means, and content is without three good friends; that  the property of rain is to wet, and fire to burn; that good pasture makes fat  sheep; and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that  hath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding or comes  of a very dull kindred         TOUCHSTONE    Such a one is a natural philosopher  Wast ever in court, shepherd?        CORIN    No, truly         TOUCHSTONE    Then thou art damned         CORIN    Nay, I hope         TOUCHSTONE    Truly, thou art damned, like an ill-roasted egg, all on one side         CORIN    For not being at court? Your reason         TOUCHSTONE    Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never saw’st good manners; if thou never  saw’st good manners, then thy manners must be wicked, and wickedness is sin,  and sin is damnation  Thou art in a parlous state, shepherd         CORIN    Not a whit, Touchstone  Those that are good manners at the court are as  ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the country is most mockable at  the court  You told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands   That courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds         TOUCHSTONE    Instance, briefly  Come, instance         CORIN    Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their fells, you know, are greasy         TOUCHSTONE    Why, do not your courtier’s hands sweat? And is not the grease of a mutton as  wholesome as the sweat of a man? Shallow, shallow  A better instance, I say   Come         CORIN    Besides, our hands are hard         TOUCHSTONE    Your lips will feel them the sooner  Shallow again  A more sounder instance,  come         CORIN    And they are often tarred over with the surgery of our sheep; and would you  have us kiss tar? The courtier’s hands are perfumed with civet         TOUCHSTONE    Most shallow man! Thou worm’s meat in respect of a good piece of flesh  indeed! Learn of the wise and perpend  Civet is of a baser birth than tar, the  very uncleanly flu f a cat  Mend the instance, shepherd         CORIN    You have too courtly a wit for me  I’ll rest         TOUCHSTONE    Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man! God make incision in thee,  thou art raw         CORIN    Sir, I am a true labourer  I earn that I eat, get that I wear, owe no man hate,  envy no man’s happiness, glad of other men’s good, content with my harm; and  the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck         TOUCHSTONE    That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes and the rams together and  to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a  bell-wether and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to crooked-pated, old,  cuckoldly ram, out of all reasonable match  If thou be’st not damned for this,  the devil himself will have no shepherds  I cannot see else how thou shouldst  ’scape       Enter  Rosalind  as Ganymede         CORIN    Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress’s brother         ROSALIND      Reads                From the east to western Inde            No jewel is like Rosalind             Her worth being mounted on the wind,            Through all the world bears Rosalind             All the pictures fairest lined            Are but black to Rosalind             Let no face be kept in mind            But the fair of Rosalind          TOUCHSTONE    I’ll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and suppers and sleeping  hours e pted  It is the right butter-women’s rank to market         ROSALIND    Out, fool!        TOUCHSTONE             For a taste:            If a hart do lack a hind,            Let him seek out Rosalind             If the cat will after kind,            So be sure will Rosalind             Winter garments must be lined,            So must slender Rosalind             They that reap must sheaf and bind,            Then to cart with Rosalind             Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,            Such a nut is Rosalind             He that sweetest rose will find            Must find love’s prick, and Rosalind    This is the very false gallop of verses  Why do you infect yourself with them?        ROSALIND    Peace, you dull fool, I found them on a tree         TOUCHSTONE    Truly, the tree yields bad fruit         ROSALIND    I’ll graft it with you, and then I shall graft it with a medlar  Then it will  be the earliest fruit i’ th’ country, for you’ll be rotten ere you be half  ripe, and that’s the right virtue of the medlar         TOUCHSTONE    You have said, but whether wisely or no, let the forest judge       Enter  Celia  as Aliena,  reading a paper       ROSALIND    Peace, here comes my sister, reading  Stand aside         CELIA      Reads                   Why should this a desert be?

Tongues I’ll hang on every tree                   That shall civil sayings show                Some, how brief the life of man                   Runs his erring pilgrimage,               That the streching of a span                   Buckles in his sum of age;               Some, of violated vows                   ’Twi the souls of friend and friend                But upon the fairest boughs,                   Or at every sentence’ end,               Will I “Rosalinda” write,                   Teaching all that read to know               The quintessence of every sprite                   Heaven would in little show                Therefore heaven nature charged                   That one body should be filled               With all graces wide-enlarged                    Nature presently distilled               Helen’s cheek, but not her heart,                   Cleopatra’s majesty;               Atalanta’s better part,                   Sad Lucretia’s modesty                Thus Rosalind of many parts                   By heavenly synod was devised,               Of many faces, eyes, and hearts                   To have the touches dearest prized                Heaven would that she these gifts should have,                   And I to live and die her slave          ROSALIND    O most gentle Jupiter, what tedious homily of love have you wearied your  parishioners withal, and never cried “Have patience, good people!”        CELIA    How now!

ORLANDO    Very well  What would you?        ROSALIND    I pray you, what is’t o’clock?        ORLANDO    You should ask me what time o’ day  There’s no clock in the forest         ROSALIND    Then there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing every minute and  groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock         ORLANDO    And why not the swift foot of time? Had not that been as proper?        ROSALIND    By no means, sir  Time travels in divers paces with divers persons  I’ll tell  you who time ambles withal, who time trots withal, who time gallops withal, and  who he stands still withal         ORLANDO    I prithee, who doth he trot withal?        ROSALIND    Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and  the day it is solemnized  If the interim be but a se’nnight, time’s pace is so  hard that it seems the length of seven year         ORLANDO    Who ambles time withal?        ROSALIND    With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath not the gout; for the  one sleeps easily because he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because  he feels no pain; the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning, the  other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury  These time ambles withal         ORLANDO    Who doth he gallop withal?        ROSALIND    With a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly as foot can fall, he  thinks himself too soon there         ORLANDO    Who stays it still withal?        ROSALIND    With lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep between term and term, and then  they perceive not how time moves         ORLANDO    Where dwell you, pretty youth?        ROSALIND    With this shepherdess, my sister, here in the skirts of the forest, like fringe  upon a petticoat         ORLANDO    Are you native of this place?        ROSALIND    As the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled         ORLANDO    Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a  dwelling         ROSALIND    I have been told so of many  But indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught  me to speak, who was in his youth an inland man, one that knew courtship too  well, for there he fell in love  I have heard him read many lectures against  it, and I thank God I am not a woman, to be touched with so many giddy offences  as he hath generally ta  their whole se ithal         ORLANDO    Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of  women?        ROSALIND    There were none principal  They were all like one another as halfpence are,  every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it         ORLANDO    I prithee recount some of them         ROSALIND    No  I will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick  There is a man  haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving “Rosalind” on their  barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles; all, forsooth,  deifying the name of Rosalind  If I could meet that fancy-monger, I would give  him some good counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him         ORLANDO    I am he that is so love-shaked  I pray you tell me your remedy         ROSALIND    There is none of my uncle’s marks upon you  He taught me how to know a man in  love, in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner         ORLANDO    What were his marks?        ROSALIND    A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken, which you have not; an  unquestionable spirit, which you have not; a beard neglected, which you have  not—but I pardon you for that, for simply your having in beard is a younger  brother’s revenue  Then your hose should be ungartered, your bonnet unbanded,  your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe untied, and everything about you  demonstrating a careless desolation  But you are no such man  You are rather  point-device in your accoutrements, as loving yourself than seeming the lover  of any other         ORLANDO    Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love         ROSALIND    Me believe it? You may as soon make her that you love believe it, which I  warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does  That is one of the points  in the which women still give the lie to their consciences  But, in good sooth,  are you he that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind is so admired?        ORLANDO    I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I am that he, that  unfortunate he         ROSALIND    But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?        ORLANDO    Neither rhyme nor reason can e ess how much         ROSALIND    Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a  whip as madmen do; and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is  that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too  Yet I profess  curing it by counsel         ORLANDO    Did you ever cure any so?        ROSALIND    Yes, one, and in this manner  He was to imagine me his love, his mistress, and  I set him every day to woo me; at which time would I, being but a moonish  youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing and liking, proud,  fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; for  every passion something and for no passion truly anything, as boys and women  are for the most part cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe  him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep for him, then spit at him;  that I drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of  madness, which was to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a  nook merely monastic  And thus I cured him, and this way will I take upon me to  wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep’s heart, that there shall not be one  spot of love in ’t         ORLANDO    I would not be cured, youth         ROSALIND    I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind and come every day to my  cote and woo me         ORLANDO    Now, by the faith of my love, I will  Tell me where it is         ROSALIND    Go with me to it, and I’ll show it you; and by the way you shall tell me  where in the forest you live  Will you go?        ORLANDO    With all my heart, good youth         ROSALIND    Nay, you must call me Rosalind  Come, sister, will you go?

Am I the man yet? Doth my simple feature content you?        AUDREY    Your features, Lord warrant us! What features?        TOUCHSTONE    I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most capricious poet, honest Ovid,  was among the Goths         JAQUES      Aside    O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove in a thatched house!        TOUCHSTONE    When a man’s verses cannot be understood, nor a man’s good wit seconded with  the forward child, understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a great  reckoning in a little room  Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical         AUDREY    I do not know what “poetical” is  Is it honest in deed and word? Is it a true  thing?        TOUCHSTONE    No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning, and lovers are given to  poetry, and what they swear in poetry may be said, as lovers, they do feign         AUDREY    Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?        TOUCHSTONE    I do, truly, for thou swear’st to me thou art honest  Now if thou wert a poet,  I might have some hope thou didst feign         AUDREY    Would you not have me honest?        TOUCHSTONE    No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; for honesty coupled to beauty is to  have honey a sauce to sugar         JAQUES      Aside    A material fool!        AUDREY    Well, I am not fair, and therefore I pray the gods make me honest         TOUCHSTONE    Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an  unclean dish         AUDREY    I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul         TOUCHSTONE    Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness; sluttishness may come hereafter   But be it as it may be, I will marry thee  And to that end I have been with Sir  Oliver Marte  the vicar of the ne village, who hath promised to meet me in  this place of the forest and to couple us         JAQUES      Aside    I would fain see this meeting         AUDREY    Well, the gods give us joy!        TOUCHSTONE    Amen  A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger in this attempt, for  here we have no temple but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts  But what  though? Courage! As horns are odious, they are necessary  It is said, “Many a  man knows no end of his goods ” Right  Many a man has good horns and knows no  end of them  Well, that is the dowry of his wife; ’tis none of his own getting   Horns? Even so  Poor men alone? No, no, the noblest deer hath them as huge as  the rascal  Is the single man therefore blessed? No  As a walled town is more  worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a married man more honourable  than the bare brow of a bachelor  And by how much defence is better than no  skill, by so much is horn more precious than to want       Enter  Sir Oliver Marte        Here comes Sir Oliver  Sir Oliver Marte  you are well met  Will you dispatch  us here under this tree, or shall we go with you to your chapel?

Get you to church, and have a good priest that can tell you what  marriage is  This fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot; then  one of you will prove a shrunk panel, and like green timber, warp, warp         TOUCHSTONE      Aside    I am not in the mind but I were better to be married of him than of  another, for he is not like to marry me well, and not being well married, it  will be a good e se for me hereafter to leave my wife         JAQUES    Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee         TOUCHSTONE    Come, sweet Audrey  We must be married, or we must live in bawdry    Farewell, good Master Oliver  Not                 O sweet Oliver,                O brave Oliver,            Leave me not behind thee     But                 Wind away,—                Begone, I say,            I will not to wedding with thee            E nt  Touchstone, Audrey  and   Jaques            MARTEXT    ’Tis no matter  Ne’er a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my  calling         E            SCENE IV  Another part of the Forest  Before a Cottage       Enter  Rosalind  and   Celia          ROSALIND    Never talk to me, I will weep         CELIA    Do, I prithee, but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a  man         ROSALIND    But have I not cause to weep?        CELIA    As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep         ROSALIND    His very hair is of the dissembling colour         CELIA    Something browner than Judas’s  Marry, his kisses are Judas’s own children         ROSALIND    I’ faith, his hair is of a good colour         CELIA    An e llent colour  Your chestnut was ever the only colour         ROSALIND    And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread         CELIA    He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana  A nun of winter’s sisterhood  kisses not more religiously; the very ice of chastity is in them         ROSALIND    But why did he swear he would come this morning, and comes not?        CELIA    Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him         ROSALIND    Do you think so?        CELIA    Yes  I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer, but for his verity in  love, I do think him as concave as a covered goblet or a worm-eaten nut         ROSALIND    Not true in love?        CELIA    Yes, when he is in, but I think he is not in         ROSALIND    You have heard him swear downright he was         CELIA    “Was” is not “is”  Besides, the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of  a tapster  They are both the confirmer of false reckonings  He attends here in  the forest on the Duke your father         ROSALIND    I met the Duke yesterday, and had much question with him  He asked me of what  parentage I was  I told him, of as good as he, so he laughed and let me go  But  what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as Orlando?        CELIA    O, that’s a brave man! He writes brave verses, speaks brave words, swears brave  oaths, and breaks them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of his lover,  as a puny tilter, that spurs his horse but on one side, breaks his staff like a  noble goose  But all’s brave that youth mounts and folly guides  Who comes  here?      Enter  Corin        CORIN    Mistress and master, you have oft enquired   After the shepherd that complained of love,   Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,   Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess   That was his mistress         CELIA    Well, and what of him?        CORIN    If you will see a pageant truly played   Between the pale comple n of true love   And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,   Go hence a little, and I shall conduct you,   If you will mark it         ROSALIND    O, come, let us remove    The sight of lovers feedeth those in love    Bring us to this sight, and you shall say   I’ll prove a busy actor in their play         E nt           SCENE V  Another part of the Forest       Enter  Silvius  and   Phoebe          SILVIUS    Sweet Phoebe, do not scorn me, do not, Phoebe    Say that you love me not, but say not so   In bitterness  The common e utioner,   Whose heart th’ accustomed sight of death makes hard,   Falls not the a upon the humbled neck   But first begs pardon  Will you sterner be   Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?        Enter  Rosalind, Celia  and   Corin , at a distance         PHOEBE    I would not be thy e utioner;   I fly thee, for I would not injure thee    Thou tell’st me there is murder in mine eye    ’Tis pretty, sure, and very probable   That eyes, that are the frail’st and softest things,   Who shut their coward gates on atomies,   Should be called tyrants, butchers, murderers    Now I do frown on thee with all my heart,   And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee    Now counterfeit to swoon; why, now fall down;   Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,   Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers    Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee    Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains   Some scar of it; lean upon a rush,   The cicatrice and capable impressure   Thy palm some moment keeps  But now mine eyes,   Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not;   Nor I am sure there is not force in eyes   That can do hurt         SILVIUS    O dear Phoebe,   If ever—as that ever may be near—   You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,   Then shall you know the wounds invisible   That love’s keen arrows make         PHOEBE    But till that time   Come not thou near me  And when that time comes,   Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not,   As till that time I shall not pity thee         ROSALIND      Advancing    And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,   That you insult, e t, and all at once,   Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty—   As, by my faith, I see no more in you   Than without candle may go dark to bed—   Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?   Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?   I see no more in you than in the ordinary   Of nature’s sale-work  ’Od’s my little life,   I think she means to tangle my eyes too!   No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it    ’Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,   Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,   That can entame my spirits to your worship    You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,   Like foggy south, puffing with wind and rain?   You are a thousand times a properer man   Than she a woman  ’Tis such fools as you   That makes the world full of ill-favoured children    ’Tis not her glass but you that flatters her,   And out of you she sees herself more proper   Than any of her lineaments can show her    But, mistress, know yourself; down on your knees,   And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man’s love    For I must tell you friendly in your ear,   Sell when you can; you are not for all markets    Cry the man mercy, love him, take his offer;   Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer    So take her to thee, shepherd  Fare you well         PHOEBE    Sweet youth, I pray you chide a year together!   I had rather hear you chide than this man woo         ROSALIND    He’s fall’n in love with your foulness, and she’ll fall in love with my anger   If it be so, as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks, I’ll sauce her  with bitter words  Why look you so upon me?        PHOEBE    For no ill will I bear you         ROSALIND    I pray you do not fall in love with me,   For I am falser than vows made in wine    Besides, I like you not  If you will know my house,   ’Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by    Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard    Come, sister  Shepherdess, look on him better,   And be not proud  Though all the world could see,   None could be so abused in sight as he    Come, to our flock           E nt  Rosalind, Celia  and   Corin            PHOEBE    Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might:   “Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?”        SILVIUS    Sweet Phoebe—        PHOEBE    Ha, what sayst thou, Silvius?        SILVIUS    Sweet Phoebe, pity me         PHOEBE    Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius         SILVIUS    Wherever sorrow is, relief would be    If you do sorrow at my grief in love,   By giving love your sorrow and my grief   Were both e rmined         PHOEBE    Thou hast my love  Is not that neighbourly?        SILVIUS    I would have you         PHOEBE    Why, that were covetousness    Silvius, the time was that I hated thee;   And yet it is not that I bear thee love;   But since that thou canst talk of love so well,   Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,   I will endure, and I’ll employ thee too    But do not look for further recompense   Than thine own gladness that thou art employed         SILVIUS    So holy and so perfect is my love,   And I in such a poverty of grace,   That I shall think it a most plenteous crop   To glean the broken ears after the man   That the main harvest reaps  Loose now and then   A scattered smile, and that I’ll live upon         PHOEBE    Know’st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?        SILVIUS    Not very well, but I have met him oft,   And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds   That the old carlot once was master of         PHOEBE    Think not I love him, though I ask for him    ’Tis but a peevish boy—yet he talks well    But what care I for words? Yet words do well   When he that speaks them pleases those that hear    It is a pretty youth—not very pretty—   But sure he’s proud, and yet his pride becomes him    He’ll make a proper man  The best thing in him   Is his comple n; and faster than his tongue   Did make offence, his eye did heal it up    He is not very tall, yet for his years he’s tall;   His leg is but so-so, and yet ’tis well    There was a pretty redness in his lip,   A little riper and more lusty red   Than that mi  in his cheek  ’Twas just the difference   Betwi the constant red and mingled damask    There be some women, Silvius, had they marked him   In parcels as I did, would have gone near   To fall in love with him; but for my part   I love him not nor hate him not; and yet   I have more cause to hate him than to love him    For what had he to do to chide at me?   He said mine eyes were black and my hair black,   And now I am remembered, scorned at me    I marvel why I answered not again    But that’s all one: omittance is no quittance    I’ll write to him a very taunting letter,   And thou shalt bear it  Wilt thou, Silvius?        SILVIUS    Phoebe, with all my heart         PHOEBE    I’ll write it straight,   The matter’s in my head and in my heart    I will be bitter with him and passing short    Go with me, Silvius         E nt                  ACT IV       SCENE I  The Forest of Arden       Enter  Rosalind, Celia  and   Jaques          JAQUES    I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with thee         ROSALIND    They say you are a melancholy fellow         JAQUES    I am so; I do love it better than laughing         ROSALIND    Those that are in e emity of either are abominable fellows, and betray  themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards         JAQUES    Why, ’tis good to be sad and say nothing         ROSALIND    Why then, ’tis good to be a post         JAQUES    I have neither the scholar’s melancholy, which is emulation; nor the  musician’s, which is fantastical; nor the courtier’s, which is proud; nor the  soldier’s, which is ambitious; nor the lawyer’s, which is politic; nor the  lady’s, which is nice; nor the lover’s, which is all these; but it is a  melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, e acted from many  objects, and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels, in which my often  rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness         ROSALIND    A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be sad  I fear you have sold  your own lands to see other men’s  Then to have seen much and to have nothing  is to have rich eyes and poor hands         JAQUES    Yes, I have gained my e rience         ROSALIND    And your e rience makes you sad  I had rather have a fool to make me merry  than e rience to make me sad—and to travel for it too       Enter  Orlando        ORLANDO    Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind!

ROSALIND    Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for  But  he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife         ORLANDO    Virtue is no horn-maker and my Rosalind is virtuous         ROSALIND    And I am your Rosalind         CELIA    It pleases him to call you so, but he hath a Rosalind of a better leer than  you         ROSALIND    Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday humour, and like enough to  consent  What would you say to me now, an I were your very, very Rosalind?        ORLANDO    I would kiss before I spoke         ROSALIND    Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were gravelled for lack of  matter, you might take occasion to kiss  Very good orators, when they are out,  they will spit; and for lovers lacking—God warn us—matter, the cleanliest  shift is to kiss         ORLANDO    How if the kiss be denied?        ROSALIND    Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter         ORLANDO    Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?        ROSALIND    Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or I should think my honesty  ranker than my wit         ORLANDO    What, of my suit?        ROSALIND    Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit  Am not I your Rosalind?        ORLANDO    I take some joy to say you are because I would be talking of her         ROSALIND    Well, in her person, I say I will not have you         ORLANDO    Then, in mine own person, I die         ROSALIND    No, faith, die by attorney  The poor world is almost si housand years old,  and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person,   videlicet , in a love-cause  Troilus had his brains dashed out with a  Grecian club, yet he did what he could to die before, and he is one of the  patterns of love  Leander, he would have lived many a fair year though Hero had  turned nun, if it had not been for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he  went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and, being taken with the cramp,  was drowned; and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was Hero of  Sestos  But these are all lies  Men have died from time to time and worms have  eaten them, but not for love         ORLANDO    I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind, for I protest her frown  might kill me         ROSALIND    By this hand, it will not kill a fly  But come, now I will be your Rosalind in  a more coming-on disposition, and ask me what you will, I will grant it         ORLANDO    Then love me, Rosalind         ROSALIND    Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all         ORLANDO    And wilt thou have me?        ROSALIND    Ay, and twenty such         ORLANDO    What sayest thou?        ROSALIND    Are you not good?        ORLANDO    I hope so         ROSALIND    Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?—Come, sister, you shall be  the priest and marry us —Give me your hand, Orlando —What do you say, sister?        ORLANDO    Pray thee, marry us         CELIA    I cannot say the words         ROSALIND    You must begin “Will you, Orlando—”          CELIA    Go to —Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?        ORLANDO    I will         ROSALIND    Ay, but when?        ORLANDO    Why now, as fast as she can marry us         ROSALIND    Then you must say “I take thee, Rosalind, for wife ”        ORLANDO    I take thee, Rosalind, for wife         ROSALIND    I might ask you for your commission  But I do take thee, Orlando, for my  husband  There’s a girl goes before the priest, and certainly a woman’s  thought runs before her actions         ORLANDO    So do all thoughts  They are winged         ROSALIND    Now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her         ORLANDO    For ever and a day         ROSALIND    Say “a day” without the “ever ” No, no, Orlando, men are April when they woo,  December when they wed  Maids are May when they are maids, but the sky changes  when they are wives  I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon  over his hen, more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more new-fangled than  an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey  I will weep for nothing, like  Diana in the fountain, and I will do that when you are disposed to be merry  I  will laugh like a hyena, and that when thou are inclined to sleep         ORLANDO    But will my Rosalind do so?        ROSALIND    By my life, she will do as I do         ORLANDO    O, but she is wise         ROSALIND    Or else she could not have the wit to do this  The wiser, the waywarder  Make  the doors upon a woman’s wit, and it will out at the casement  Shut that, and  ’twill out at the keyhole  Stop that, ’twill fly with the smoke out at the  chimney         ORLANDO    A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say, “Wit, whither wilt?”        ROSALIND    Nay, you might keep that check for it till you met your wife’s wit going to  your neighbour’s bed         ORLANDO    And what wit could wit have to e se that?        ROSALIND    Marry, to say she came to seek you there  You shall never take her without her  answer unless you take her without her tongue  O, that woman that cannot make  her fault her husband’s occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for  she will breed it like a fool         ORLANDO    For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee         ROSALIND    Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours         ORLANDO    I must attend the Duke at dinner  By two o’clock I will be with thee again         ROSALIND    Ay, go your ways, go your ways  I knew what you would prove  My friends told me  as much, and I thought no less  That flattering tongue of yours won me  ’Tis  but one cast away, and so, come death! Two o’clock is your hour?        ORLANDO    Ay, sweet Rosalind         ROSALIND    By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and by all pretty oaths  that are not dangerous, if you break one jot of your promise or come one  minute behind your hour, I will think you the most pathetical break-promise,  and the most hollow lover, and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that  may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful  Therefore beware my  censure, and keep your promise         ORLANDO    With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind  So, adieu         ROSALIND    Well, Time is the old justice that e ines all such offenders, and let time  try  Adieu         E   Orlando          CELIA    You have simply misused our se n your love-prate! We must have your doublet  and hose plucked over your head and show the world what the bird hath done to  her own nest         ROSALIND    O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst know how many fathom  deep I am in love! But it cannot be sounded; my affection hath an unknown  bottom, like the Bay of Portugal         CELIA    Or rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour affection in, it runs out         ROSALIND    No, that same wicked bastard of Venus, that was begot of thought, conceived of  spleen, and born of madness, that blind rascally boy that abuses everyone’s  eyes because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I am in love  I’ll  tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando  I’ll go find a  shadow and sigh till he come         CELIA    And I’ll sleep         E nt           SCENE II  Another part of the Forest     Enter  Jaques  and Lords, like  foresters       JAQUES    Which is he that killed the deer?        FIRST LORD    Sir, it was I         JAQUES    Let’s present him to the Duke, like a Roman conqueror, and it would do well to  set the deer’s horns upon his head for a branch of victory  Have you no song,  forester, for this purpose?        SECOND LORD    Yes, sir         JAQUES    Sing it  ’Tis no matter how it be in tune, so it make noise enough         SONG        SECOND LORD      Sings        What shall he have that killed the deer?           His leather skin and horns to wear                      Then sing him home:       The rest shall bear this burden                  Take thou no scorn to wear the horn                It was a crest ere thou wast born                      Thy father’s father wore it                     And thy father bore it                The horn, the horn, the lusty horn               Is not a thing to laugh to scorn         E nt           SCENE III  Another part of the Forest       Enter  Rosalind  and   Celia          ROSALIND    How say you now?

She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;   She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,   Were man as rare as phoeni ’Od’s my will,   Her love is not the hare that I do hunt    Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,   This is a letter of your own device         SILVIUS    No, I protest, I know not the contents    Phoebe did write it         ROSALIND    Come, come, you are a fool,   And turned into the e emity of love    I saw her hand  She has a leathern hand,   A freestone-coloured hand  I verily did think   That her old gloves were on, but ’twas her hands    She has a huswife’s hand—but that’s no matter    I say she never did invent this letter;   This is a man’s invention, and his hand         SILVIUS    Sure, it is hers         ROSALIND    Why, ’tis a boisterous and a cruel style,   A style for challengers  Why, she defies me,   Like Turk to Christian  Women’s gentle brain   Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention,   Such Ethiop words, blacker in their effect   Than in their countenance  Will you hear the letter?        SILVIUS    So please you, for I never heard it yet,   Yet heard too much of Phoebe’s cruelty         ROSALIND    She Phoebes me  Mark how the tyrant writes         Reads                      Art thou god to shepherd turned,               That a maiden’s heart hath burned?    Can a woman rail thus?        SILVIUS    Call you this railing?        ROSALIND                 Why, thy godhead laid apart,               Warr’st thou with a woman’s heart?    Did you ever hear such railing?                Whiles the eye of man did woo me,               That could do no vengeance to me     Meaning me a beast                 If the scorn of your bright eyne               Have power to raise such love in mine,               Alack, in me what strange effect               Would they work in mild aspect?               Whiles you chid me, I did love,               How then might your prayers move?               He that brings this love to thee               Little knows this love in me;               And by him seal up thy mind,               Whether that thy youth and kind               Will the faithful offer take               Of me, and all that I can make,               Or else by him my love deny,               And then I’ll study how to die          SILVIUS    Call you this chiding?        CELIA    Alas, poor shepherd         ROSALIND    Do you pity him? No, he deserves no pity —Wilt thou love such a woman? What, to  make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee? Not to be endured!  Well, go your way to her, for I see love hath made thee a tame snake, and say  this to her: that if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will not, I  will never have her unless thou entreat for her  If you be a true lover, hence,  and not a word, for here comes more company         E   Silvius        Enter  Oliver        OLIVER    Good morrow, fair ones  Pray you, if you know,   Where in the purlieus of this forest stands   A sheepcote fenced about with olive trees?

OLIVER    Twice did he turn his back and purposed so;   But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,   And nature, stronger than his just occasion,   Made him give battle to the lioness,   Who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling   From miserable slumber I awaked         CELIA    Are you his brother?        ROSALIND    Was it you he rescued?        CELIA    Was’t you that did so oft contrive to kill him?

ROSALIND    By my life, I do, which I tender dearly, though I say I am a magician   Therefore put you in your best array, bid your friends; for if you will be  married tomorrow, you shall, and to Rosalind, if you will         Enter  Silvius  and   Phoebe          Look, here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers         PHOEBE    Youth, you have done me much ungentleness   To show the letter that I writ to you         ROSALIND    I care not if I have; it is my study   To seem despiteful and ungentle to you    You are there followed by a faithful shepherd    Look upon him, love him; he worships you         PHOEBE    Good shepherd, tell this youth what ’tis to love         SILVIUS    It is to be all made of sighs and tears,   And so am I for Phoebe         PHOEBE    And I for Ganymede         ORLANDO    And I for Rosalind         ROSALIND    And I for no woman         SILVIUS    It is to be all made of faith and service,   And so am I for Phoebe         PHOEBE    And I for Ganymede         ORLANDO    And I for Rosalind         ROSALIND    And I for no woman         SILVIUS    It is to be all made of fantasy,   All made of passion, and all made of wishes,   All adoration, duty, and observance,   All humbleness, all patience, and impatience,   All purity, all trial, all observance,   And so am I for Phoebe         PHOEBE    And so am I for Ganymede         ORLANDO    And so am I for Rosalind         ROSALIND    And so am I for no woman         PHOEBE      To Rosalind    If this be so, why blame you me to love you?

ORLANDO    That would I, were I of all kingdoms king         ROSALIND      To Phoebe    You say you’ll marry me if I be willing?

DUKE SENIOR    I like him very well         TOUCHSTONE    God ’ild you, sir, I desire you of the like  I press in here, sir, amongst the  rest of the country copulatives, to swear and to forswear according as  marriage binds and blood breaks  A poor virgin, sir, an ill-favoured thing,  sir, but mine own; a poor humour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else  will  Rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house, as your pearl in  your foul oyster         DUKE SENIOR    By my faith, he is very swift and sententious         TOUCHSTONE    According to the fool’s bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases         JAQUES    But, for the seventh cause  How did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause?        TOUCHSTONE    Upon a lie seven times removed—bear your body more seeming, Audrey—as thus,  sir  I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier’s beard  He sent me word if I  said his beard was not cut well, he was in the mind it was  This is called the  “retort courteous”  If I sent him word again it was not well cut, he would send  me word he cut it to please himself  This is called the “quip modest”  If again  it was not well cut, he disabled my judgement  This is called the “reply  churlish”  If again it was not well cut, he would answer I spake not true  This  is called the “reproof valiant”  If again it was not well cut, he would say I  lie  This is called the “countercheck quarrelsome”, and so, to the “lie  circumstantial”, and the “lie direct”         JAQUES    And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?        TOUCHSTONE    I durst go no further than the lie circumstantial, nor he durst not give me the  lie direct; and so we measured swords and parted         JAQUES    Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?        TOUCHSTONE    O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book, as you have books for good manners  I  will name you the degrees: the first, the retort courteous; the second, the  quip modest; the third, the reply churlish; the fourth, the reproof valiant;  the fifth, the countercheck quarrelsome; the si , the lie with circumstance;  the seventh, the lie direct  All these you may avoid but the lie direct and  you may avoid that too with an “if”  I knew when seven justices could not take  up a quarrel, but when the parties were met themselves, one of them thought but  of an “if”, as, “if you said so, then I said so;” and they shook hands, and  swore brothers  Your “if” is the only peacemaker; much virtue in “if ”        JAQUES    Is not this a rare fellow, my lord?

And you brides and bridegrooms all,   With measure heaped in joy to th’ measures fall         JAQUES    Sir, by your patience  If I heard you rightly,   The Duke hath put on a religious life   And thrown into neglect the pompous court         JAQUES DE BOYS    He hath         JAQUES    To him will I  Out of these convertites   There is much matter to be heard and learned      To Duke Senior    You to your former honour I bequeath;   Your patience and your virtue well deserves it      To Orlando    You to a love that your true faith doth merit      To Oliver    You to your land, and love, and great allies      To Silvius    You to a long and well-deserved bed      To Touchstone    And you to wrangling, for thy loving voyage   Is but for two months victualled —So to your pleasures,   I am for other than for dancing measures         DUKE SENIOR    Stay, Jaques, stay         JAQUES    To see no pastime, I  What you would have   I’ll stay to know at your abandoned cave         E          DUKE SENIOR    Proceed, proceed!

I am not furnished like  a beggar; therefore to beg will not become me  My way is to conjure you, and  I’ll begin with the women  I charge you, O women, for the love you bear to men,  to like as much of this play as please you  And I charge you, O men, for the  love you bear to women—as I perceive by your simpering, none of you hates  them—that between you and the women the play may please  If I were a woman, I  would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased me, comple ns that liked  me, and breaths that I defied not  And I am sure as many as have good beards,  or good faces, or sweet breaths will for my kind offer, when I make curtsy,  bid me farewell         E               <a '"
