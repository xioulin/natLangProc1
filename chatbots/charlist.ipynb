       "'ACT I       SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.       Enter  Francisco  and  Barnardo , two sentinels.        BARNARDO.   Who’s there?         FRANCISCO.   Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.         BARNARDO.   Long live the King!         FRANCISCO.   Barnardo?         BARNARDO.   He.         FRANCISCO.   You come most carefully upon your hour.         BARNARDO.   ’Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.         FRANCISCO.   For this relief much thanks. ’Tis bitter cold,   And I am sick at heart.         BARNARDO.   Have you had quiet guard?         FRANCISCO.   Not a mouse stirring.         BARNARDO.   Well, good night.   If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,   The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.         Enter  Horatio  and  Marcellus .        FRANCISCO.   I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?         HORATIO.   Friends to this ground.         MARCELLUS.   And liegemen to the Dane.         FRANCISCO.   Give you good night.         MARCELLUS.   O, farewell, honest soldier, who hath reliev’d you?         FRANCISCO.   Barnardo has my place. Give you good-night.         [ Exit. ]        MARCELLUS.   Holla, Barnardo!         BARNARDO.   Say, what, is Horatio there?         HORATIO.   A piece of him.         BARNARDO.   Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.         MARCELLUS.   What, has this thing appear’d again tonight?         BARNARDO.   I have seen nothing.         MARCELLUS.   Horatio says ’tis but our fantasy,   And will not let belief take hold of him   Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.   Therefore I have entreated him along   With us to watch the minutes of this night,   That if again this apparition come   He may approve our eyes and speak to it.         HORATIO.   Tush, tush, ’twill not appear.         BARNARDO.   Sit down awhile,   And let us once again assail your ears,   That are so fortified against our story,   What we two nights have seen.         HORATIO.   Well, sit we down,   And let us hear Barnardo speak of this.         BARNARDO.   Last night of all,   When yond same star that’s westward from the pole,   Had made his course t’illume that part of heaven   Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,   The bell then beating one—         MARCELLUS.   Peace, break thee off. Look where it comes again.         Enter  Ghost .        BARNARDO.   In the same figure, like the King that’s dead.         MARCELLUS.   Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.         BARNARDO.   Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.         HORATIO.   Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.         BARNARDO   It would be spoke to.         MARCELLUS.   Question it, Horatio.         HORATIO.   What art thou that usurp’st this time of night,   Together with that fair and warlike form   In which the majesty of buried Denmark   Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak.         MARCELLUS.   It is offended.         BARNARDO.   See, it stalks away.         HORATIO.   Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee speak!         [ Exit  Ghost . ]        MARCELLUS.   ’Tis gone, and will not answer.         BARNARDO.   How now, Horatio! You tremble and look pale.   Is not this something more than fantasy?   What think you on’t?         HORATIO.   Before my God, I might not this believe   Without the sensible and true avouch   Of mine own eyes.         MARCELLUS.   Is it not like the King?         HORATIO.   As thou art to thyself:   Such was the very armour he had on   When he th’ambitious Norway combated;   So frown’d he once, when in an angry parle   He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.   ’Tis strange.         MARCELLUS.   Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,   With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.         HORATIO.   In what particular thought to work I know not;   But in the gross and scope of my opinion,   This bodes some strange eruption to our state.         MARCELLUS.   Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,   Why this same strict and most observant watch   So nightly toils the subject of the land,   And why such daily cast of brazen cannon   And foreign mart for implements of war;   Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task   Does not divide the Sunday from the week.   What might be toward, that this sweaty haste   Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:   Who is’t that can inform me?         HORATIO.   That can I;   At least, the whisper goes so. Our last King,   Whose image even but now appear’d to us,   Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,   Thereto prick’d on by a most emulate pride,   Dar’d to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet,   For so this side of our known world esteem’d him,   Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal’d compact,   Well ratified by law and heraldry,   Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands   Which he stood seiz’d of, to the conqueror;   Against the which, a moiety competent   Was gaged by our King; which had return’d   To the inheritance of Fortinbras,   Had he been vanquisher; as by the same cov’nant   And carriage of the article design’d,   His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,   Of unimproved mettle, hot and full,   Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,   Shark’d up a list of lawless resolutes,   For food and diet, to some enterprise   That hath a stomach in’t; which is no other,   As it doth well appear unto our state,   But to recover of us by strong hand   And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands   So by his father lost. And this, I take it,   Is the main motive of our preparations,   The source of this our watch, and the chief head   Of this post-haste and rummage in the land.         BARNARDO.   I think it be no other but e’en so:   Well may it sort that this portentous figure   Comes armed through our watch so like the King   That was and is the question of these wars.         HORATIO.   A mote it is to trouble the mind’s eye.   In the most high and palmy state of Rome,   A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,   The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead   Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;   As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,   Disasters in the sun; and the moist star,   Upon whose influence Neptune’s empire stands,   Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.   And even the like precurse of fierce events,   As harbingers preceding still the fates   And prologue to the omen coming on,   Have heaven and earth together demonstrated   Unto our climatures and countrymen.         Re-enter  Ghost .        But, soft, behold! Lo, where it comes again!   I’ll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!   If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,   Speak to me.   If there be any good thing to be done,   That may to thee do ease, and grace to me,   Speak to me.   If thou art privy to thy country’s fate,   Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid,   O speak!   Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life   Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,   For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,   Speak of it. Stay, and speak!        [ The cock crows. ]        Stop it, Marcellus!         MARCELLUS.   Shall I strike at it with my partisan?         HORATIO.   Do, if it will not stand.         BARNARDO.   ’Tis here!         HORATIO.   ’Tis here!         [ Exit  Ghost . ]        MARCELLUS.   ’Tis gone!   We do it wrong, being so majestical,   To offer it the show of violence,   For it is as the air, invulnerable,   And our vain blows malicious mockery.         BARNARDO.   It was about to speak, when the cock crew.         HORATIO.   And then it started, like a guilty thing   Upon a fearful summons. I have heard   The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,   Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat   Awake the god of day; and at his warning,   Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,   Th’extravagant and erring spirit hies   To his confine. And of the truth herein   This present object made probation.         MARCELLUS.   It faded on the crowing of the cock.   Some say that ever ’gainst that season comes   Wherein our Saviour’s birth is celebrated,   The bird of dawning singeth all night long;   And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,   The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,   No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm;   So hallow’d and so gracious is the time.         HORATIO.   So have I heard, and do in part believe it.   But look, the morn in russet mantle clad,   Walks o’er the dew of yon high eastward hill.   Break we our watch up, and by my advice,   Let us impart what we have seen tonight   Unto young Hamlet; for upon my life,   This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.   Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,   As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?         MARCELLUS.   Let’s do’t, I pray, and I this morning know   Where we shall find him most conveniently.         [ Exeunt. ]          SCENE II. Elsinore. A room of  state in the Castle.       Enter Claudius  King  of Denmark, Gertrude the   Queen, Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes, Voltemand,   Cornelius, Lords  and  Attendant .        KING.   Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother’s death   The memory be green, and that it us befitted   To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom   To be contracted in one brow of woe;   Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature   That we with wisest sorrow think on him,   Together with remembrance of ourselves.   Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,   Th’imperial jointress to this warlike state,   Have we, as ’twere with a defeated joy,   With one auspicious and one dropping eye,   With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,   In equal scale weighing delight and dole,   Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr’d   Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone   With this affair along. For all, our thanks.   Now follows, that you know young Fortinbras,   Holding a weak supposal of our worth,   Or thinking by our late dear brother’s death   Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,   Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,   He hath not fail’d to pester us with message,   Importing the surrender of those lands   Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,   To our most valiant brother. So much for him.   Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:   Thus much the business is: we have here writ   To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,   Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears   Of this his nephew’s purpose, to suppress   His further gait herein; in that the levies,   The lists, and full proportions are all made   Out of his subject: and we here dispatch   You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,   For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,   Giving to you no further personal power   To business with the King, more than the scope   Of these dilated articles allow.   Farewell; and let your haste commend your duty.         CORNELIUS and VOLTEMAND.   In that, and all things, will we show our duty.         KING.   We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.         [ Exeunt  Voltemand  and  Cornelius . ]        And now, Laertes, what’s the news with you?   You told us of some suit. What is’t, Laertes?   You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,   And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,   That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?   The head is not more native to the heart,   The hand more instrumental to the mouth,   Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.   What wouldst thou have, Laertes?         LAERTES.   Dread my lord,   Your leave and favour to return to France,   From whence though willingly I came to Denmark   To show my duty in your coronation;   Yet now I must confess, that duty done,   My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France,   And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.         KING.   Have you your father’s leave? What says Polonius?         POLONIUS.   He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave   By laboursome petition; and at last   Upon his will I seal’d my hard consent.   I do beseech you give him leave to go.         KING.   Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,   And thy best graces spend it at thy will!   But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son—         HAMLET.   [ Aside. ] A little more than kin, and less than kind.         KING.   How is it that the clouds still hang on you?         HAMLET.   Not so, my lord, I am too much i’ the sun.         QUEEN.   Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,   And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.   Do not for ever with thy vailed lids   Seek for thy noble father in the dust.   Thou know’st ’tis common, all that lives must die,   Passing through nature to eternity.         HAMLET.   Ay, madam, it is common.         QUEEN.   If it be,   Why seems it so particular with thee?         HAMLET.   Seems, madam! Nay, it is; I know not seems.   ’Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,   Nor customary suits of solemn black,   Nor windy suspiration of forc’d breath,   No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,   Nor the dejected haviour of the visage,   Together with all forms, moods, shows of grief,   That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,   For they are actions that a man might play;   But I have that within which passeth show;   These but the trappings and the suits of woe.         KING.   ’Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,   To give these mourning duties to your father;   But you must know, your father lost a father,   That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound   In filial obligation, for some term   To do obsequious sorrow. But to persevere   In obstinate condolement is a course   Of impious stubbornness. ’Tis unmanly grief,   It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,   A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,   An understanding simple and unschool’d;   For what we know must be, and is as common   As any the most vulgar thing to sense,   Why should we in our peevish opposition   Take it to heart? Fie, ’tis a fault to heaven,   A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,   To reason most absurd, whose common theme   Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,   From the first corse till he that died today,   ‘This must be so.’ We pray you throw to earth   This unprevailing woe, and think of us   As of a father; for let the world take note   You are the most immediate to our throne,   And with no less nobility of love   Than that which dearest father bears his son   Do I impart toward you. For your intent   In going back to school in Wittenberg,   It is most retrograde to our desire:   And we beseech you bend you to remain   Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,   Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.         QUEEN.   Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.   I pray thee stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.         HAMLET.   I shall in all my best obey you, madam.         KING.   Why, ’tis a loving and a fair reply.   Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;   This gentle and unforc’d accord of Hamlet   Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,   No jocund health that Denmark drinks today   But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,   And the King’s rouse the heaven shall bruit again,   Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.         [ Exeunt all but  Hamlet . ]        HAMLET.   O that this too too solid flesh would melt,   Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!   Or that the Everlasting had not fix’d   His canon ’gainst self-slaughter. O God! O God!   How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable   Seem to me all the uses of this world!   Fie on’t! Oh fie! ’tis an unweeded garden   That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature   Possess it merely. That it should come to this!   But two months dead—nay, not so much, not two:   So excellent a king; that was to this   Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother,   That he might not beteem the winds of heaven   Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!   Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him   As if increase of appetite had grown   By what it fed on; and yet, within a month—   Let me not think on’t—Frailty, thy name is woman!   A little month, or ere those shoes were old   With which she followed my poor father’s body   Like Niobe, all tears.—Why she, even she—   O God! A beast that wants discourse of reason   Would have mourn’d longer,—married with mine uncle,   My father’s brother; but no more like my father   Than I to Hercules. Within a month,   Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears   Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,   She married. O most wicked speed, to post   With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!   It is not, nor it cannot come to good.   But break, my heart, for I must hold my tongue.         Enter  Horatio, Marcellus  and  Barnardo .        HORATIO.   Hail to your lordship!         HAMLET.   I am glad to see you well:   Horatio, or I do forget myself.         HORATIO.   The same, my lord,   And your poor servant ever.        HAMLET.   Sir, my good friend;   I’ll change that name with you:   And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?—   Marcellus?         MARCELLUS.   My good lord.         HAMLET.   I am very glad to see you.—Good even, sir.—   But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?         HORATIO.   A truant disposition, good my lord.         HAMLET.   I would not hear your enemy say so;   Nor shall you do my ear that violence,   To make it truster of your own report   Against yourself. I know you are no truant.   But what is your affair in Elsinore?   We’ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.         HORATIO.   My lord, I came to see your father’s funeral.         HAMLET.   I prithee do not mock me, fellow-student.   I think it was to see my mother’s wedding.         HORATIO.   Indeed, my lord, it follow’d hard upon.         HAMLET.   Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak’d meats   Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.   Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven   Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio.   My father,—methinks I see my father.         HORATIO.   Where, my lord?         HAMLET.   In my mind’s eye, Horatio.         HORATIO.   I saw him once; he was a goodly king.         HAMLET.   He was a man, take him for all in all,   I shall not look upon his like again.         HORATIO.   My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.         HAMLET.   Saw? Who?         HORATIO.   My lord, the King your father.         HAMLET.   The King my father!         HORATIO.   Season your admiration for a while   With an attent ear, till I may deliver   Upon the witness of these gentlemen   This marvel to you.         HAMLET.   For God’s love let me hear.         HORATIO.   Two nights together had these gentlemen,   Marcellus and Barnardo, on their watch   In the dead waste and middle of the night,   Been thus encounter’d. A figure like your father,   Armed at point exactly, cap-à-pie,   Appears before them, and with solemn march   Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk’d   By their oppress’d and fear-surprised eyes,   Within his truncheon’s length; whilst they, distill’d   Almost to jelly with the act of fear,   Stand dumb, and speak not to him. This to me   In dreadful secrecy impart they did,   And I with them the third night kept the watch,   Where, as they had deliver’d, both in time,   Form of the thing, each word made true and good,   The apparition comes. I knew your father;   These hands are not more like.         HAMLET.   But where was this?         MARCELLUS.   My lord, upon the platform where we watch.         HAMLET.   Did you not speak to it?         HORATIO.   My lord, I did;   But answer made it none: yet once methought   It lifted up it head, and did address   Itself to motion, like as it would speak.   But even then the morning cock crew loud,   And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,   And vanish’d from our sight.         HAMLET.   ’Tis very strange.         HORATIO.   As I do live, my honour’d lord, ’tis true;   And we did think it writ down in our duty   To let you know of it.         HAMLET.   Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.   Hold you the watch tonight?         MARCELLUS and BARNARDO.   We do, my lord.         HAMLET.   Arm’d, say you?         Both.   Arm’d, my lord.         HAMLET.   From top to toe?         BOTH.   My lord, from head to foot.         HAMLET.   Then saw you not his face?         HORATIO.   O yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up.         HAMLET.   What, look’d he frowningly?         HORATIO.   A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.         HAMLET.   Pale, or red?         HORATIO.   Nay, very pale.         HAMLET.   And fix’d his eyes upon you?         HORATIO.   Most constantly.         HAMLET.   I would I had been there.         HORATIO.   It would have much amaz’d you.         HAMLET.   Very like, very like. Stay’d it long?         HORATIO.   While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.         MARCELLUS and BARNARDO.   Longer, longer.         HORATIO.   Not when I saw’t.         HAMLET.   His beard was grizzled, no?         HORATIO.   It was, as I have seen it in his life,   A sable silver’d.         HAMLET.   I will watch tonight;   Perchance ’twill walk again.         HORATIO.   I warrant you it will.         HAMLET.   If it assume my noble father’s person,   I’ll speak to it, though hell itself should gape   And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,   If you have hitherto conceal’d this sight,   Let it be tenable in your silence still;   And whatsoever else shall hap tonight,   Give it an understanding, but no tongue.   I will requite your loves. So, fare ye well.   Upon the platform ’twixt eleven and twelve,   I’ll visit you.         ALL.   Our duty to your honour.         HAMLET.   Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.         [ Exeunt  Horatio, Marcellus  and  Barnardo . ]        My father’s spirit in arms! All is not well;   I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!   Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,   Though all the earth o’erwhelm them, to men’s eyes.         [ Exit. ]          SCENE III. A room in  Polonius’s house.       Enter  Laertes  and  Ophelia .        LAERTES.   My necessaries are embark’d. Farewell.   And, sister, as the winds give benefit   And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,   But let me hear from you.         OPHELIA.   Do you doubt that?         LAERTES.   For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,   Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood;   A violet in the youth of primy nature,   Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting;   The perfume and suppliance of a minute;   No more.         OPHELIA.   No more but so?         LAERTES.   Think it no more.   For nature crescent does not grow alone   In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,   The inward service of the mind and soul   Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,   And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch   The virtue of his will; but you must fear,   His greatness weigh’d, his will is not his own;   For he himself is subject to his birth:   He may not, as unvalu’d persons do,   Carve for himself; for on his choice depends   The sanctity and health of this whole state;   And therefore must his choice be circumscrib’d   Unto the voice and yielding of that body   Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,   It fits your wisdom so far to believe it   As he in his particular act and place   May give his saying deed; which is no further   Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.   Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain   If with too credent ear you list his songs,   Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open   To his unmaster’d importunity.   Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister;   And keep you in the rear of your affection,   Out of the shot and danger of desire.   The chariest maid is prodigal enough   If she unmask her beauty to the moon.   Virtue itself ’scapes not calumnious strokes:   The canker galls the infants of the spring   Too oft before their buttons be disclos’d,   And in the morn and liquid dew of youth   Contagious blastments are most imminent.   Be wary then, best safety lies in fear.   Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.         OPHELIA.   I shall th’effect of this good lesson keep   As watchman to my heart. But good my brother,   Do not as some ungracious pastors do,   Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;   Whilst like a puff’d and reckless libertine   Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,   And recks not his own rede.         LAERTES.   O, fear me not.   I stay too long. But here my father comes.         Enter  Polonius .        A double blessing is a double grace;   Occasion smiles upon a second leave.         POLONIUS.   Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame.   The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,   And you are stay’d for. There, my blessing with you.         [ Laying his hand on  Laertes’s  head. ]        And these few precepts in thy memory   Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,   Nor any unproportion’d thought his act.   Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.   Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,   Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;   But do not dull thy palm with entertainment   Of each new-hatch’d, unfledg’d comrade. Beware   Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,   Bear’t that th’opposed may beware of thee.   Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice:   Take each man’s censure, but reserve thy judgement.   Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,   But not express’d in fancy; rich, not gaudy:   For the apparel oft proclaims the man;   And they in France of the best rank and station   Are of a most select and generous chief in that.   Neither a borrower nor a lender be:   For loan oft loses both itself and friend;   And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.   This above all: to thine own self be true;   And it must follow, as the night the day,   Thou canst not then be false to any man.   Farewell: my blessing season this in thee.         LAERTES.   Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.         POLONIUS.   The time invites you; go, your servants tend.         LAERTES.   Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well   What I have said to you.         OPHELIA.   ’Tis in my memory lock’d,   And you yourself shall keep the key of it.         LAERTES.   Farewell.         [ Exit. ]        POLONIUS.   What is’t, Ophelia, he hath said to you?         OPHELIA.   So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.         POLONIUS.   Marry, well bethought:   ’Tis told me he hath very oft of late   Given private time to you; and you yourself   Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.   If it be so,—as so ’tis put on me,   And that in way of caution,—I must tell you   You do not understand yourself so clearly   As it behoves my daughter and your honour.   What is between you? Give me up the truth.         OPHELIA.   He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders   Of his affection to me.         POLONIUS.   Affection! Pooh! You speak like a green girl,   Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.   Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?         OPHELIA.   I do not know, my lord, what I should think.         POLONIUS.   Marry, I’ll teach you; think yourself a baby;   That you have ta’en these tenders for true pay,   Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;   Or,—not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,   Running it thus,—you’ll tender me a fool.         OPHELIA.   My lord, he hath importun’d me with love   In honourable fashion.         POLONIUS.   Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.         OPHELIA.   And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,   With almost all the holy vows of heaven.         POLONIUS.   Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,   When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul   Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,   Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,   Even in their promise, as it is a-making,   You must not take for fire. From this time   Be something scanter of your maiden presence;   Set your entreatments at a higher rate   Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,   Believe so much in him that he is young;   And with a larger tether may he walk   Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,   Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,   Not of that dye which their investments show,   But mere implorators of unholy suits,   Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,   The better to beguile. This is for all:   I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth   Have you so slander any moment leisure   As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.   Look to’t, I charge you; come your ways.         OPHELIA.   I shall obey, my lord.         [ Exeunt. ]          SCENE IV. The  platform.       Enter  Hamlet, Horatio  and  Marcellus .        HAMLET.   The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.         HORATIO.   It is a nipping and an eager air.         HAMLET.   What hour now?         HORATIO.   I think it lacks of twelve.         MARCELLUS.   No, it is struck.         HORATIO.   Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season   Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.         [ A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off within. ]        What does this mean, my lord?        HAMLET.   The King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse,   Keeps wassail, and the swaggering upspring reels;   And as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,   The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out   The triumph of his pledge.         HORATIO.   Is it a custom?         HAMLET.   Ay marry is’t;   And to my mind, though I am native here,   And to the manner born, it is a custom   More honour’d in the breach than the observance.   This heavy-headed revel east and west   Makes us traduc’d and tax’d of other nations:   They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase   Soil our addition; and indeed it takes   From our achievements, though perform’d at height,   The pith and marrow of our attribute.   So oft it chances in particular men   That for some vicious mole of nature in them,   As in their birth, wherein they are not guilty,   Since nature cannot choose his origin,   By their o’ergrowth of some complexion,   Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason;   Or by some habit, that too much o’erleavens   The form of plausive manners;—that these men,   Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,   Being Nature’s livery or Fortune’s star,—   His virtues else,—be they as pure as grace,   As infinite as man may undergo,   Shall in the general censure take corruption   From that particular fault. The dram of evil   Doth all the noble substance of a doubt   To his own scandal.         HORATIO.   Look, my lord, it comes!         Enter  Ghost .        HAMLET.   Angels and ministers of grace defend us!   Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn’d,   Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,   Be thy intents wicked or charitable,   Thou com’st in such a questionable shape   That I will speak to thee. I’ll call thee Hamlet,   King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me!   Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell   Why thy canoniz’d bones, hearsed in death,   Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,   Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn’d,   Hath op’d his ponderous and marble jaws   To cast thee up again! What may this mean,   That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,   Revisit’st thus the glimpses of the moon,   Making night hideous, and we fools of nature   So horridly to shake our disposition   With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?   Say, why is this? Wherefore? What should we do?         [  Ghost  beckons  Hamlet . ]        HORATIO.   It beckons you to go away with it,   As if it some impartment did desire   To you alone.         MARCELLUS.   Look with what courteous action   It waves you to a more removed ground.   But do not go with it.         HORATIO.   No, by no means.         HAMLET.   It will not speak; then will I follow it.         HORATIO.   Do not, my lord.         HAMLET.   Why, what should be the fear?   I do not set my life at a pin’s fee;   And for my soul, what can it do to that,   Being a thing immortal as itself?   It waves me forth again. I’ll follow it.         HORATIO.   What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,   Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff   That beetles o’er his base into the sea,   And there assume some other horrible form   Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason,   And draw you into madness? Think of it.   The very place puts toys of desperation,   Without more motive, into every brain   That looks so many fathoms to the sea   And hears it roar beneath.         HAMLET.   It waves me still.   Go on, I’ll follow thee.         MARCELLUS.   You shall not go, my lord.         HAMLET.   Hold off your hands.         HORATIO.   Be rul’d; you shall not go.         HAMLET.   My fate cries out,   And makes each petty artery in this body   As hardy as the Nemean lion’s nerve.         [  Ghost  beckons. ]        Still am I call’d. Unhand me, gentlemen.        [ Breaking free from them. ]        By heaven, I’ll make a ghost of him that lets me.   I say, away!—Go on, I’ll follow thee.         [ Exeunt  Ghost  and  Hamlet . ]        HORATIO.   He waxes desperate with imagination.         MARCELLUS.   Let’s follow; ’tis not fit thus to obey him.         HORATIO.   Have after. To what issue will this come?         MARCELLUS.   Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.         HORATIO.   Heaven will direct it.         MARCELLUS.   Nay, let’s follow him.         [ Exeunt. ]          SCENE V. A more remote part of  the Castle.       Enter  Ghost  and  Hamlet .        HAMLET.   Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak, I’ll go no further.         GHOST.   Mark me.         HAMLET.   I will.         GHOST.   My hour is almost come,   When I to sulph’rous and tormenting flames   Must render up myself.         HAMLET.   Alas, poor ghost!         GHOST.   Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing   To what I shall unfold.         HAMLET.   Speak, I am bound to hear.         GHOST.   So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.         HAMLET.   What?         GHOST.   I am thy father’s spirit,   Doom’d for a certain term to walk the night,   And for the day confin’d to fast in fires,   Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature   Are burnt and purg’d away. But that I am forbid   To tell the secrets of my prison-house,   I could a tale unfold whose lightest word   Would harrow up thy soul; freeze thy young blood,   Make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres,   Thy knotted and combined locks to part,   And each particular hair to stand on end   Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.   But this eternal blazon must not be   To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!   If thou didst ever thy dear father love—         HAMLET.   O God!         GHOST.   Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.         HAMLET.   Murder!         GHOST.   Murder most foul, as in the best it is;   But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.         HAMLET.   Haste me to know’t, that I, with wings as swift   As meditation or the thoughts of love   May sweep to my revenge.         GHOST.   I find thee apt;   And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed   That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,   Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.   ’Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,   A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark   Is by a forged process of my death   Rankly abus’d; but know, thou noble youth,   The serpent that did sting thy father’s life   Now wears his crown.         HAMLET.   O my prophetic soul!   Mine uncle!         GHOST.   Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,   With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,—   O wicked wit, and gifts, that have the power   So to seduce!—won to his shameful lust   The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.   O Hamlet, what a falling off was there,   From me, whose love was of that dignity   That it went hand in hand even with the vow   I made to her in marriage; and to decline   Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor   To those of mine. But virtue, as it never will be mov’d,   Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven;   So lust, though to a radiant angel link’d,   Will sate itself in a celestial bed   And prey on garbage.   But soft! methinks I scent the morning air;   Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,   My custom always of the afternoon,   Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole   With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,   And in the porches of my ears did pour   The leperous distilment, whose effect   Holds such an enmity with blood of man   That swift as quicksilver it courses through   The natural gates and alleys of the body;   And with a sudden vigour it doth posset   And curd, like eager droppings into milk,   The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;   And a most instant tetter bark’d about,   Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust   All my smooth body.   Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother’s hand,   Of life, of crown, of queen at once dispatch’d:   Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,   Unhous’led, disappointed, unanel’d;   No reckoning made, but sent to my account   With all my imperfections on my head.   O horrible! O horrible! most horrible!   If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;   Let not the royal bed of Denmark be   A couch for luxury and damned incest.   But howsoever thou pursu’st this act,   Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive   Against thy mother aught; leave her to heaven,   And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,   To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!   The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,   And ’gins to pale his uneffectual fire.   Adieu, adieu, adieu. Remember me.         [ Exit. ]        HAMLET.   O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?   And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, my heart;   And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,   But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?   Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat   In this distracted globe. Remember thee?   Yea, from the table of my memory   I’ll wipe away all trivial fond records,   All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,   That youth and observation copied there;   And thy commandment all alone shall live   Within the book and volume of my brain,   Unmix’d with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!   O most pernicious woman!   O villain, villain, smiling damned villain!   My tables. Meet it is I set it down,   That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain!   At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.         [ Writing. ]        So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;   It is ‘Adieu, adieu, remember me.’   I have sworn’t.         HORATIO and MARCELLUS.   [ Within. ] My lord, my lord.         MARCELLUS.   [ Within. ] Lord Hamlet.         HORATIO.   [ Within. ] Heaven secure him.         HAMLET.   So be it!         MARCELLUS.   [ Within. ] Illo, ho, ho, my lord!         HAMLET.   Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.         Enter  Horatio  and  Marcellus .        MARCELLUS.   How is’t, my noble lord?         HORATIO.   What news, my lord?         HAMLET.   O, wonderful!         HORATIO.   Good my lord, tell it.         HAMLET.   No, you’ll reveal it.         HORATIO.   Not I, my lord, by heaven.         MARCELLUS.   Nor I, my lord.         HAMLET.   How say you then, would heart of man once think it?—   But you’ll be secret?         HORATIO and MARCELLUS.   Ay, by heaven, my lord.         HAMLET.   There’s ne’er a villain dwelling in all Denmark   But he’s an arrant knave.         HORATIO.   There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave   To tell us this.         HAMLET.   Why, right; you are i’ the right;   And so, without more circumstance at all,   I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:   You, as your business and desire shall point you,—   For every man hath business and desire,   Such as it is;—and for my own poor part,   Look you, I’ll go pray.         HORATIO.   These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.         HAMLET.   I’m sorry they offend you, heartily;   Yes faith, heartily.         HORATIO.   There’s no offence, my lord.         HAMLET.   Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,   And much offence too. Touching this vision here,   It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.   For your desire to know what is between us,   O’ermaster’t as you may. And now, good friends,   As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,   Give me one poor request.         HORATIO.   What is’t, my lord? We will.         HAMLET.   Never make known what you have seen tonight.         HORATIO and MARCELLUS.   My lord, we will not.         HAMLET.   Nay, but swear’t.         HORATIO.   In faith, my lord, not I.         MARCELLUS.   Nor I, my lord, in faith.         HAMLET.   Upon my sword.         MARCELLUS.   We have sworn, my lord, already.         HAMLET.   Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.         GHOST.   [ Cries under the stage. ] Swear.         HAMLET.   Ha, ha boy, sayst thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?   Come on, you hear this fellow in the cellarage.   Consent to swear.         HORATIO.   Propose the oath, my lord.         HAMLET.   Never to speak of this that you have seen.   Swear by my sword.         GHOST.   [ Beneath. ] Swear.         HAMLET.    Hic et ubique?  Then we’ll shift our ground.   Come hither, gentlemen,   And lay your hands again upon my sword.   Never to speak of this that you have heard.   Swear by my sword.         GHOST.   [ Beneath. ] Swear.         HAMLET.   Well said, old mole! Canst work i’ th’earth so fast?   A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.         HORATIO.   O day and night, but this is wondrous strange.         HAMLET.   And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.   There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,   Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come,   Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,   How strange or odd soe’er I bear myself,—   As I perchance hereafter shall think meet   To put an antic disposition on—   That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,   With arms encumber’d thus, or this head-shake,   Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,   As ‘Well, we know’, or ‘We could and if we would’,   Or ‘If we list to speak’; or ‘There be and if they might’,   Or such ambiguous giving out, to note   That you know aught of me:—this not to do.   So grace and mercy at your most need help you,   Swear.         GHOST.   [ Beneath. ] Swear.         HAMLET.   Rest, rest, perturbed spirit. So, gentlemen,   With all my love I do commend me to you;   And what so poor a man as Hamlet is   May do t’express his love and friending to you,   God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together,   And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.   The time is out of joint. O cursed spite,   That ever I was born to set it right.   Nay, come, let’s go together.         [ Exeunt. ]                 ACT II       SCENE I. A room in Polonius’s house.       Enter  Polonius  and  Reynaldo .        POLONIUS.   Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.         REYNALDO.   I will, my lord.         POLONIUS.   You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,   Before you visit him, to make inquiry   Of his behaviour.         REYNALDO.   My lord, I did intend it.         POLONIUS.   Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,   Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;   And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,   What company, at what expense; and finding   By this encompassment and drift of question,   That they do know my son, come you more nearer   Than your particular demands will touch it.   Take you as ’twere some distant knowledge of him,   As thus, ‘I know his father and his friends,   And in part him’—do you mark this, Reynaldo?         REYNALDO.   Ay, very well, my lord.         POLONIUS.   ‘And in part him, but,’ you may say, ‘not well;   But if’t be he I mean, he’s very wild;   Addicted so and so;’ and there put on him   What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank   As may dishonour him; take heed of that;   But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips   As are companions noted and most known   To youth and liberty.         REYNALDO.   As gaming, my lord?         POLONIUS.   Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing,   Quarrelling, drabbing. You may go so far.         REYNALDO.   My lord, that would dishonour him.         POLONIUS.   Faith no, as you may season it in the charge.   You must not put another scandal on him,   That he is open to incontinency;   That’s not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly   That they may seem the taints of liberty;   The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,   A savageness in unreclaimed blood,   Of general assault.         REYNALDO.   But my good lord—         POLONIUS.   Wherefore should you do this?         REYNALDO.   Ay, my lord, I would know that.         POLONIUS.   Marry, sir, here’s my drift,   And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.   You laying these slight sullies on my son,   As ’twere a thing a little soil’d i’ th’ working,   Mark you,   Your party in converse, him you would sound,   Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes   The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur’d   He closes with you in this consequence;   ‘Good sir,’ or so; or ‘friend,’ or ‘gentleman’—   According to the phrase or the addition   Of man and country.         REYNALDO.   Very good, my lord.         POLONIUS.   And then, sir, does he this,—   He does—What was I about to say?   By the mass, I was about to say something. Where did I leave?         REYNALDO.   At ‘closes in the consequence.’   At ‘friend or so,’ and ‘gentleman.’        POLONIUS.   At ‘closes in the consequence’ ay, marry!   He closes with you thus: ‘I know the gentleman,   I saw him yesterday, or t’other day,   Or then, or then, with such and such; and, as you say,   There was he gaming, there o’ertook in’s rouse,   There falling out at tennis’: or perchance,   ‘I saw him enter such a house of sale’—    Videlicet , a brothel, or so forth. See you now;   Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;   And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,   With windlasses, and with assays of bias,   By indirections find directions out.   So by my former lecture and advice   Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?         REYNALDO.   My lord, I have.         POLONIUS.   God b’ wi’ you, fare you well.         REYNALDO.   Good my lord.         POLONIUS.   Observe his inclination in yourself.         REYNALDO.   I shall, my lord.         POLONIUS.   And let him ply his music.         REYNALDO.   Well, my lord.         POLONIUS.   Farewell.         [ Exit  Reynaldo . ]        Enter  Ophelia .        How now, Ophelia, what’s the matter?        OPHELIA.   Alas, my lord, I have been so affrighted.         POLONIUS.   With what, in the name of God?         OPHELIA.   My lord, as I was sewing in my chamber,   Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac’d,   No hat upon his head, his stockings foul’d,   Ungart’red, and down-gyved to his ankle,   Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,   And with a look so piteous in purport   As if he had been loosed out of hell   To speak of horrors, he comes before me.         POLONIUS.   Mad for thy love?         OPHELIA.   My lord, I do not know, but truly I do fear it.         POLONIUS.   What said he?         OPHELIA.   He took me by the wrist and held me hard;   Then goes he to the length of all his arm;   And with his other hand thus o’er his brow,   He falls to such perusal of my face   As he would draw it. Long stay’d he so,   At last,—a little shaking of mine arm,   And thrice his head thus waving up and down,   He rais’d a sigh so piteous and profound   As it did seem to shatter all his bulk   And end his being. That done, he lets me go,   And with his head over his shoulder turn’d   He seem’d to find his way without his eyes,   For out o’ doors he went without their help,   And to the last bended their light on me.         POLONIUS.   Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.   This is the very ecstasy of love,   Whose violent property fordoes itself,   And leads the will to desperate undertakings,   As oft as any passion under heaven   That does afflict our natures. I am sorry,—   What, have you given him any hard words of late?         OPHELIA.   No, my good lord; but as you did command,   I did repel his letters and denied   His access to me.         POLONIUS.   That hath made him mad.   I am sorry that with better heed and judgement   I had not quoted him. I fear’d he did but trifle,   And meant to wreck thee. But beshrew my jealousy!   It seems it is as proper to our age   To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions   As it is common for the younger sort   To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.   This must be known, which, being kept close, might move   More grief to hide than hate to utter love.         [ Exeunt. ]          SCENE II. A room in the  Castle.       Enter  King, Queen, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern  and   Attendants .        KING.   Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.   Moreover that we much did long to see you,   The need we have to use you did provoke   Our hasty sending. Something have you heard   Of Hamlet’s transformation; so I call it,   Since nor th’exterior nor the inward man   Resembles that it was. What it should be,   More than his father’s death, that thus hath put him   So much from th’understanding of himself,   I cannot dream of. I entreat you both   That, being of so young days brought up with him,   And since so neighbour’d to his youth and humour,   That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court   Some little time, so by your companies   To draw him on to pleasures and to gather,   So much as from occasion you may glean,   Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus   That, open’d, lies within our remedy.         QUEEN.   Good gentlemen, he hath much talk’d of you,   And sure I am, two men there are not living   To whom he more adheres. If it will please you   To show us so much gentry and good will   As to expend your time with us awhile,   For the supply and profit of our hope,   Your visitation shall receive such thanks   As fits a king’s remembrance.         ROSENCRANTZ.   Both your majesties   Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,   Put your dread pleasures more into command   Than to entreaty.         GUILDENSTERN.   We both obey,   And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,   To lay our service freely at your feet   To be commanded.         KING.   Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.         QUEEN.   Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.   And I beseech you instantly to visit   My too much changed son. Go, some of you,   And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.         GUILDENSTERN.   Heavens make our presence and our practices   Pleasant and helpful to him.         QUEEN.   Ay, amen.         [ Exeunt  Rosencrantz, Guildenstern  and some   Attendants . ]        Enter  Polonius .        POLONIUS.   Th’ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,   Are joyfully return’d.         KING.   Thou still hast been the father of good news.         POLONIUS.   Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,   I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,   Both to my God and to my gracious King:   And I do think,—or else this brain of mine   Hunts not the trail of policy so sure   As it hath us’d to do—that I have found   The very cause of Hamlet’s lunacy.         KING.   O speak of that, that do I long to hear.         POLONIUS.   Give first admittance to th’ambassadors;   My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.         KING.   Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.         [ Exit  Polonius . ]        He tells me, my sweet queen, that he hath found   The head and source of all your son’s distemper.         QUEEN.   I doubt it is no other but the main,   His father’s death and our o’erhasty marriage.         KING.   Well, we shall sift him.         Enter  Polonius  with  Voltemand  and  Cornelius .        Welcome, my good friends!   Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?         VOLTEMAND.   Most fair return of greetings and desires.   Upon our first, he sent out to suppress   His nephew’s levies, which to him appear’d   To be a preparation ’gainst the Polack;   But better look’d into, he truly found   It was against your Highness; whereat griev’d,   That so his sickness, age, and impotence   Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests   On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,   Receives rebuke from Norway; and in fine,   Makes vow before his uncle never more   To give th’assay of arms against your Majesty.   Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,   Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,   And his commission to employ those soldiers   So levied as before, against the Polack:   With an entreaty, herein further shown,   [ Gives a paper. ]   That it might please you to give quiet pass   Through your dominions for this enterprise,   On such regards of safety and allowance   As therein are set down.         KING.   It likes us well;   And at our more consider’d time we’ll read,   Answer, and think upon this business.   Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.   Go to your rest, at night we’ll feast together:.   Most welcome home.         [ Exeunt  Voltemand  and  Cornelius . ]        POLONIUS.   This business is well ended.   My liege and madam, to expostulate   What majesty should be, what duty is,   Why day is day, night night, and time is time   Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.   Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,   And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,   I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.   Mad call I it; for to define true madness,   What is’t but to be nothing else but mad?   But let that go.         QUEEN.   More matter, with less art.         POLONIUS.   Madam, I swear I use no art at all.   That he is mad, ’tis true: ’tis true ’tis pity;   And pity ’tis ’tis true. A foolish figure,   But farewell it, for I will use no art.   Mad let us grant him then. And now remains   That we find out the cause of this effect,   Or rather say, the cause of this defect,   For this effect defective comes by cause.   Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend,   I have a daughter—have whilst she is mine—   Who in her duty and obedience, mark,   Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.   [ Reads. ]    To the celestial, and my soul’s idol, the most beautified Ophelia —   That’s an ill phrase, a vile phrase; ‘beautified’ is a vile   phrase: but you shall hear.   [ Reads. ]    these; in her excellent white bosom, these, &amp;c.          QUEEN.   Came this from Hamlet to her?         POLONIUS.   Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.   [ Reads. ]      Doubt thou the stars are fire,        Doubt that the sun doth move,      Doubt truth to be a liar,        But never doubt I love.   O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers. I have not art to reckon my groans.  But that I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.     Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,        HAMLET.    This in obedience hath my daughter show’d me;   And more above, hath his solicitings,   As they fell out by time, by means, and place,   All given to mine ear.         KING.   But how hath she receiv’d his love?         POLONIUS.   What do you think of me?         KING.   As of a man faithful and honourable.         POLONIUS.   I would fain prove so. But what might you think,   When I had seen this hot love on the wing,   As I perceiv’d it, I must tell you that,   Before my daughter told me, what might you,   Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,   If I had play’d the desk or table-book,   Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,   Or look’d upon this love with idle sight,   What might you think? No, I went round to work,   And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:   ‘Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.   This must not be.’ And then I precepts gave her,   That she should lock herself from his resort,   Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.   Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,   And he, repulsed,—a short tale to make—   Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,   Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,   Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,   Into the madness wherein now he raves,   And all we wail for.         KING.   Do you think ’tis this?         QUEEN.   It may be, very likely.         POLONIUS.   Hath there been such a time, I’d fain know that,   That I have positively said ‘’Tis so,’   When it prov’d otherwise?         KING.   Not that I know.         POLONIUS.   Take this from this, if this be otherwise.   [ Points to his head and shoulder. ]   If circumstances lead me, I will find   Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed   Within the centre.         KING.   How may we try it further?         POLONIUS.   You know sometimes he walks four hours together   Here in the lobby.         QUEEN.   So he does indeed.         POLONIUS.   At such a time I’ll loose my daughter to him.   Be you and I behind an arras then,   Mark the encounter. If he love her not,   And be not from his reason fall’n thereon,   Let me be no assistant for a state,   But keep a farm and carters.         KING.   We will try it.         Enter  Hamlet,  reading.        QUEEN.   But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.         POLONIUS.   Away, I do beseech you, both away   I’ll board him presently. O, give me leave.         [ Exeunt  King, Queen  and  Attendants . ]        How does my good Lord Hamlet?        HAMLET.   Well, God-a-mercy.         POLONIUS.   Do you know me, my lord?         HAMLET.   Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.         POLONIUS.   Not I, my lord.         HAMLET.   Then I would you were so honest a man.         POLONIUS.   Honest, my lord?         HAMLET.   Ay sir, to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten  thousand.        POLONIUS.   That’s very true, my lord.         HAMLET.   For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a good kissing carrion,—   Have you a daughter?        POLONIUS.   I have, my lord.         HAMLET.   Let her not walk i’ th’ sun. Conception is a blessing, but not as your daughter  may conceive. Friend, look to’t.        POLONIUS.   How say you by that? [ Aside. ] Still harping on my daughter. Yet he knew  me not at first; he said I was a fishmonger. He is far gone, far gone. And  truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for love; very near this. I’ll  speak to him again.—What do you read, my lord?        HAMLET.   Words, words, words.         POLONIUS.   What is the matter, my lord?         HAMLET.   Between who?         POLONIUS.   I mean the matter that you read, my lord.         HAMLET.   Slanders, sir. For the satirical slave says here that old men have grey beards;  that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree  gum; and that they have a plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams.  All which, sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it  not honesty to have it thus set down. For you yourself, sir, should be old as I  am, if like a crab you could go backward.        POLONIUS.   [ Aside. ] Though this be madness, yet there is method in’t.—   Will you walk out of the air, my lord?         HAMLET.   Into my grave?         POLONIUS.   Indeed, that is out o’ the air. [ Aside. ] How pregnant sometimes his  replies are! A happiness that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity  could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will leave him and suddenly  contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter.   My honourable lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.        HAMLET.   You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more willingly part withal,  except my life, except my life, except my life.        POLONIUS.   Fare you well, my lord.         HAMLET.   These tedious old fools.         Enter  Rosencrantz  and  Guildenstern .        POLONIUS.   You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.         ROSENCRANTZ.   [ To Polonius. ] God save you, sir.         [ Exit  Polonius . ]        GUILDENSTERN.   My honoured lord!         ROSENCRANTZ.   My most dear lord!         HAMLET.   My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz. Good  lads, how do ye both?        ROSENCRANTZ.   As the indifferent children of the earth.         GUILDENSTERN.   Happy in that we are not over-happy;   On Fortune’s cap we are not the very button.         HAMLET.   Nor the soles of her shoe?         ROSENCRANTZ.   Neither, my lord.         HAMLET.   Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favours?        GUILDENSTERN.   Faith, her privates we.         HAMLET.   In the secret parts of Fortune? O, most true; she is a strumpet. What’s the  news?        ROSENCRANTZ.   None, my lord, but that the world’s grown honest.         HAMLET.   Then is doomsday near. But your news is not true. Let me question more in  particular. What have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of Fortune,  that she sends you to prison hither?        GUILDENSTERN.   Prison, my lord?         HAMLET.   Denmark’s a prison.         ROSENCRANTZ.   Then is the world one.         HAMLET.   A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and dungeons, Denmark  being one o’ th’ worst.        ROSENCRANTZ.   We think not so, my lord.         HAMLET.   Why, then ’tis none to you; for there is nothing either good or bad but  thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.        ROSENCRANTZ.   Why, then your ambition makes it one; ’tis too narrow for your mind.        HAMLET.   O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a king of infinite  space, were it not that I have bad dreams.        GUILDENSTERN.   Which dreams, indeed, are ambition; for the very substance of the ambitious is  merely the shadow of a dream.        HAMLET.   A dream itself is but a shadow.         ROSENCRANTZ.   Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a  shadow’s shadow.        HAMLET.   Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch’d heroes the  beggars’ shadows. Shall we to th’ court? For, by my fay, I cannot reason.        ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN.   We’ll wait upon you.         HAMLET.   No such matter. I will not sort you with the rest of my servants; for, to speak  to you like an honest man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the beaten  way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?        ROSENCRANTZ.   To visit you, my lord, no other occasion.         HAMLET.   Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you. And sure, dear  friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it your  own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come;  nay, speak.        GUILDENSTERN.   What should we say, my lord?         HAMLET.   Why, anything. But to the purpose. You were sent for; and there is a kind of  confession in your looks, which your modesties have not craft enough to colour.  I know the good King and Queen have sent for you.        ROSENCRANTZ.   To what end, my lord?         HAMLET.   That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights of our  fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the obligation of our  ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you  withal, be even and direct with me, whether you were sent for or no.        ROSENCRANTZ.   [ To Guildenstern. ] What say you?         HAMLET.   [ Aside. ] Nay, then I have an eye of you. If you love me, hold not off.        GUILDENSTERN.   My lord, we were sent for.         HAMLET.   I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your  secrecy to the King and Queen moult no feather. I have of late, but wherefore I  know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it  goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth, seems to  me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy the air, look you, this  brave o’erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire,  why, it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of  vapours. What a piece of work is man, how noble in reason, how infinite in  faculties, in form and moving, how express and admirable; in action how like an  angel, in apprehension, how like a god: the beauty of the world, the paragon of  animals. And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not  me; no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.        ROSENCRANTZ.   My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.         HAMLET.   Why did you laugh then, when I said ‘Man delights not me’?         ROSENCRANTZ.   To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what Lenten entertainment the  players shall receive from you. We coted them on the way, and hither are they  coming to offer you service.        HAMLET.   He that plays the king shall be welcome,—his Majesty shall have tribute of me;  the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not sigh  gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in peace; the clown shall make  those laugh whose lungs are tickle o’ th’ sere; and the lady shall say her mind  freely, or the blank verse shall halt for’t. What players are they?        ROSENCRANTZ.   Even those you were wont to take such delight in—the tragedians of the city.        HAMLET.   How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in reputation and profit, was  better both ways.        ROSENCRANTZ.   I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation.        HAMLET.   Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city? Are they so  followed?        ROSENCRANTZ.   No, indeed, they are not.         HAMLET.   How comes it? Do they grow rusty?         ROSENCRANTZ.   Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is, sir, an aerie of  children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question, and are most  tyrannically clapped for’t. These are now the fashion, and so berattle the  common stages—so they call them—that many wearing rapiers are afraid of  goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.        HAMLET.   What, are they children? Who maintains ’em? How are they escoted? Will they  pursue the quality no longer than they can sing? Will they not say afterwards,  if they should grow themselves to common players—as it is most like, if their  means are no better—their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against  their own succession?        ROSENCRANTZ.   Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation holds it no sin  to tarre them to controversy. There was for a while, no money bid for argument  unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question.        HAMLET.   Is’t possible?         GUILDENSTERN.   O, there has been much throwing about of brains.         HAMLET.   Do the boys carry it away?         ROSENCRANTZ.   Ay, that they do, my lord. Hercules and his load too.         HAMLET.   It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and those that would  make mouths at him while my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred  ducats apiece for his picture in little. ’Sblood, there is something in this  more than natural, if philosophy could find it out.        [ Flourish of trumpets within. ]        GUILDENSTERN.   There are the players.         HAMLET.   Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come. The appurtenance of  welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply with you in this garb, lest my  extent to the players, which I tell you must show fairly outward, should more  appear like entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my uncle-father and  aunt-mother are deceived.        GUILDENSTERN.   In what, my dear lord?         HAMLET.   I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly, I know a hawk from a  handsaw.        Enter  Polonius .        POLONIUS.   Well be with you, gentlemen.         HAMLET.   Hark you, Guildenstern, and you too, at each ear a hearer. That great baby you  see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts.        ROSENCRANTZ.   Happily he’s the second time come to them; for they say an old man is twice a  child.        HAMLET.   I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it.—You say right,  sir: for a Monday morning ’twas so indeed.        POLONIUS.   My lord, I have news to tell you.         HAMLET.   My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in Rome—         POLONIUS.   The actors are come hither, my lord.         HAMLET.   Buzz, buzz.         POLONIUS.   Upon my honour.         HAMLET.   Then came each actor on his ass—         POLONIUS.   The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral,  pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical,  tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or poem unlimited.  Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light, for the law of writ and the  liberty. These are the only men.        HAMLET.   O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!         POLONIUS.   What treasure had he, my lord?         HAMLET.   Why—      ’One fair daughter, and no more,      The which he loved passing well.’         POLONIUS.   [ Aside. ] Still on my daughter.         HAMLET.   Am I not i’ th’ right, old Jephthah?         POLONIUS.   If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I love passing well.        HAMLET.   Nay, that follows not.         POLONIUS.   What follows then, my lord?         HAMLET.   Why,      As by lot, God wot,   and then, you know,      It came to pass, as most like it was.   The first row of the pious chanson will show you more. For look where my  abridgement comes.        Enter four or five  Players .        You are welcome, masters, welcome all. I am glad to see thee well. Welcome,  good friends. O, my old friend! Thy face is valanc’d since I saw thee last.  Com’st thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young lady and mistress! By’r  lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the  altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of uncurrent gold, be  not cracked within the ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We’ll e’en to’t like  French falconers, fly at anything we see. We’ll have a speech straight. Come,  give us a taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.        FIRST PLAYER.   What speech, my lord?         HAMLET.   I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted, or if it was, not  above once, for the play, I remember, pleased not the million, ’twas caviare to  the general. But it was—as I received it, and others, whose judgements in such  matters cried in the top of mine—an excellent play, well digested in the  scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said there  were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury, nor no matter in the  phrase that might indite the author of affectation, but called it an honest  method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One  speech in it, I chiefly loved. ’Twas Aeneas’ tale to Dido, and thereabout of it  especially where he speaks of Priam’s slaughter. If it live in your memory,  begin at this line, let me see, let me see:       The rugged Pyrrhus, like th’ Hyrcanian beast,—    It is not so: it begins with Pyrrhus—       The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,      Black as his purpose, did the night resemble      When he lay couched in the ominous horse,      Hath now this dread and black complexion smear’d      With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot      Now is he total gules, horridly trick’d      With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,      Bak’d and impasted with the parching streets,      That lend a tyrannous and a damned light      To their vile murders. Roasted in wrath and fire,      And thus o’ersized with coagulate gore,      With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus      Old grandsire Priam seeks.    So, proceed you.        POLONIUS.   ’Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion.        FIRST PLAYER.       Anon he finds him,      Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,      Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,      Repugnant to command. Unequal match’d,      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;      But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword      Th’unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,      Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top      Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus’ ear. For lo, his sword,      Which was declining on the milky head      Of reverend Priam, seem’d i’ th’air to stick.      So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,      And like a neutral to his will and matter,      Did nothing.      But as we often see against some storm,      A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,      The bold winds speechless, and the orb below      As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder      Doth rend the region; so after Pyrrhus’ pause,      Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work,      And never did the Cyclops’ hammers fall      On Mars’s armour, forg’d for proof eterne,      With less remorse than Pyrrhus’ bleeding sword      Now falls on Priam.      Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,      In general synod, take away her power;      Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,      And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,      As low as to the fiends.          POLONIUS.   This is too long.         HAMLET.   It shall to the barber’s, with your beard.—Prithee say on.   He’s for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps.   Say on; come to Hecuba.         FIRST PLAYER.       But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen,—          HAMLET.   ‘The mobled queen’?         POLONIUS.   That’s good! ‘Mobled queen’ is good.         FIRST PLAYER.       Run barefoot up and down, threat’ning the flames      With bisson rheum. A clout upon that head      Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,      About her lank and all o’erteemed loins,      A blanket, in th’alarm of fear caught up—      Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep’d,      ’Gainst Fortune’s state would treason have pronounc’d.      But if the gods themselves did see her then,      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport      In mincing with his sword her husband’s limbs,      The instant burst of clamour that she made,—      Unless things mortal move them not at all,—      Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,      And passion in the gods.          POLONIUS.   Look, where he has not turn’d his colour, and has tears in’s eyes. Pray you, no  more.        HAMLET.   ’Tis well. I’ll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.—Good my lord, will  you see the players well bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for they  are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time. After your death you were  better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.        POLONIUS.   My lord, I will use them according to their desert.         HAMLET.   God’s bodikin, man, much better. Use every man after his desert, and who should  ’scape whipping? Use them after your own honour and dignity. The less they  deserve, the more merit is in your bounty. Take them in.        POLONIUS.   Come, sirs.         HAMLET.   Follow him, friends. We’ll hear a play tomorrow.         [ Exeunt  Polonius  with all the  Players  but the First. ]        Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play  The Murder of Gonzago ?         FIRST PLAYER.   Ay, my lord.         HAMLET.   We’ll ha’t tomorrow night. You could for a need study a speech of some dozen or  sixteen lines, which I would set down and insert in’t, could you not?        FIRST PLAYER.   Ay, my lord.         HAMLET.   Very well. Follow that lord, and look you mock him not.         [ Exit  First Player . ]        [ To Rosencrantz and Guildenstern ] My good friends, I’ll leave you till  night. You are welcome to Elsinore.        ROSENCRANTZ.   Good my lord.         [ Exeunt  Rosencrantz  and  Guildenstern . ]        HAMLET.   Ay, so, God b’ wi’ ye. Now I am alone.   O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!   Is it not monstrous that this player here,   But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,   Could force his soul so to his own conceit   That from her working all his visage wan’d;   Tears in his eyes, distraction in’s aspect,   A broken voice, and his whole function suiting   With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!   For Hecuba?   What’s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,   That he should weep for her? What would he do,   Had he the motive and the cue for passion   That I have? He would drown the stage with tears   And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;   Make mad the guilty, and appal the free,   Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed,   The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,   A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak   Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,   And can say nothing. No, not for a king   Upon whose property and most dear life   A damn’d defeat was made. Am I a coward?   Who calls me villain, breaks my pate across?   Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?   Tweaks me by the nose, gives me the lie i’ th’ throat   As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this?   Ha! ’Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be   But I am pigeon-liver’d, and lack gall   To make oppression bitter, or ere this   I should have fatted all the region kites   With this slave’s offal. Bloody, bawdy villain!   Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!   Oh vengeance!   Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,   That I, the son of a dear father murder’d,   Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,   Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words   And fall a-cursing like a very drab,   A scullion! Fie upon’t! Foh!   About, my brain! I have heard   That guilty creatures sitting at a play,   Have by the very cunning of the scene,   Been struck so to the soul that presently   They have proclaim’d their malefactions.   For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak   With most miraculous organ. I’ll have these players   Play something like the murder of my father   Before mine uncle. I’ll observe his looks;   I’ll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,   I know my course. The spirit that I have seen   May be the devil, and the devil hath power   T’assume a pleasing shape, yea, and perhaps   Out of my weakness and my melancholy,   As he is very potent with such spirits,   Abuses me to damn me. I’ll have grounds   More relative than this. The play’s the thing   Wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the King.         [ Exit. ]                 ACT III       SCENE I. A room in the Castle.       Enter  King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz   and  Guildenstern .        KING.   And can you by no drift of circumstance   Get from him why he puts on this confusion,   Grating so harshly all his days of quiet   With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?         ROSENCRANTZ.   He does confess he feels himself distracted,   But from what cause he will by no means speak.         GUILDENSTERN.   Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,   But with a crafty madness keeps aloof   When we would bring him on to some confession   Of his true state.         QUEEN.   Did he receive you well?         ROSENCRANTZ.   Most like a gentleman.         GUILDENSTERN.   But with much forcing of his disposition.         ROSENCRANTZ.   Niggard of question, but of our demands,   Most free in his reply.         QUEEN.   Did you assay him to any pastime?         ROSENCRANTZ.   Madam, it so fell out that certain players   We o’er-raught on the way. Of these we told him,   And there did seem in him a kind of joy   To hear of it. They are about the court,   And, as I think, they have already order   This night to play before him.         POLONIUS.   ’Tis most true;   And he beseech’d me to entreat your Majesties   To hear and see the matter.         KING.   With all my heart; and it doth much content me   To hear him so inclin’d.   Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,   And drive his purpose on to these delights.         ROSENCRANTZ.   We shall, my lord.         [ Exeunt  Rosencrantz  and  Guildenstern . ]        KING.   Sweet Gertrude, leave us too,   For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,   That he, as ’twere by accident, may here   Affront Ophelia.   Her father and myself, lawful espials,   Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,   We may of their encounter frankly judge,   And gather by him, as he is behav’d,   If’t be th’affliction of his love or no   That thus he suffers for.         QUEEN.   I shall obey you.   And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish   That your good beauties be the happy cause   Of Hamlet’s wildness: so shall I hope your virtues   Will bring him to his wonted way again,   To both your honours.         OPHELIA.   Madam, I wish it may.         [ Exit  Queen . ]        POLONIUS.   Ophelia, walk you here.—Gracious, so please you,   We will bestow ourselves.—[ To Ophelia. ] Read on this book,   That show of such an exercise may colour   Your loneliness.—We are oft to blame in this,   ’Tis too much prov’d, that with devotion’s visage   And pious action we do sugar o’er   The devil himself.         KING.   [ Aside. ] O ’tis too true!   How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!   The harlot’s cheek, beautied with plastering art,   Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it   Than is my deed to my most painted word.   O heavy burden!         POLONIUS.   I hear him coming. Let’s withdraw, my lord.         [ Exeunt  King  and  Polonius . ]        Enter  Hamlet .        HAMLET.   To be, or not to be, that is the question:   Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer   The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,   Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,   And by opposing end them? To die—to sleep,   No more; and by a sleep to say we end   The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks   That flesh is heir to: ’tis a consummation   Devoutly to be wish’d. To die, to sleep.   To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there’s the rub,   For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,   When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,   Must give us pause. There’s the respect   That makes calamity of so long life.   For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,   The oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,   The pangs of dispriz’d love, the law’s delay,   The insolence of office, and the spurns   That patient merit of the unworthy takes,   When he himself might his quietus make   With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,   To grunt and sweat under a weary life,   But that the dread of something after death,   The undiscover’d country, from whose bourn   No traveller returns, puzzles the will,   And makes us rather bear those ills we have   Than fly to others that we know not of?   Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,   And thus the native hue of resolution   Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,   And enterprises of great pith and moment,   With this regard their currents turn awry   And lose the name of action. Soft you now,   The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons   Be all my sins remember’d.         OPHELIA.   Good my lord,   How does your honour for this many a day?         HAMLET.   I humbly thank you; well, well, well.         OPHELIA.   My lord, I have remembrances of yours   That I have longed long to re-deliver.   I pray you, now receive them.         HAMLET.   No, not I.   I never gave you aught.         OPHELIA.   My honour’d lord, you know right well you did,   And with them words of so sweet breath compos’d   As made the things more rich; their perfume lost,   Take these again; for to the noble mind   Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.   There, my lord.         HAMLET.   Ha, ha! Are you honest?         OPHELIA.   My lord?         HAMLET.   Are you fair?         OPHELIA.   What means your lordship?         HAMLET.   That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your  beauty.        OPHELIA.   Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?         HAMLET.   Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it  is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness.  This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof. I did love you  once.        OPHELIA.   Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.         HAMLET.   You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock  but we shall relish of it. I loved you not.        OPHELIA.   I was the more deceived.         HAMLET.   Get thee to a nunnery. Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am myself  indifferent honest; but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were  better my mother had not borne me. I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious, with  more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to  give them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I do  crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves all, believe none of  us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where’s your father?        OPHELIA.   At home, my lord.         HAMLET.   Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool nowhere but in’s own  house. Farewell.        OPHELIA.   O help him, you sweet heavens!         HAMLET.   If thou dost marry, I’ll give thee this plague for thy dowry. Be thou as chaste  as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a nunnery,  go: farewell. Or if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well  enough what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.  Farewell.        OPHELIA.   O heavenly powers, restore him!         HAMLET.   I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath given you one face,  and you make yourselves another. You jig, you amble, and you lisp, and nickname  God’s creatures, and make your wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I’ll no more  on’t, it hath made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages. Those that  are married already, all but one, shall live; the rest shall keep as they are.  To a nunnery, go.        [ Exit. ]        OPHELIA.   O, what a noble mind is here o’erthrown!   The courtier’s, soldier’s, scholar’s, eye, tongue, sword,   Th’expectancy and rose of the fair state,   The glass of fashion and the mould of form,   Th’observ’d of all observers, quite, quite down!   And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,   That suck’d the honey of his music vows,   Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,   Like sweet bells jangled out of tune and harsh,   That unmatch’d form and feature of blown youth   Blasted with ecstasy. O woe is me,   T’have seen what I have seen, see what I see.         Enter  King  and  Polonius .        KING.   Love? His affections do not that way tend,   Nor what he spake, though it lack’d form a little,   Was not like madness. There’s something in his soul   O’er which his melancholy sits on brood,   And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose   Will be some danger, which for to prevent,   I have in quick determination   Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England   For the demand of our neglected tribute:   Haply the seas and countries different,   With variable objects, shall expel   This something settled matter in his heart,   Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus   From fashion of himself. What think you on’t?         POLONIUS.   It shall do well. But yet do I believe   The origin and commencement of his grief   Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia?   You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said,   We heard it all. My lord, do as you please,   But if you hold it fit, after the play,   Let his queen mother all alone entreat him   To show his grief, let her be round with him,   And I’ll be plac’d, so please you, in the ear   Of all their conference. If she find him not,   To England send him; or confine him where   Your wisdom best shall think.         KING.   It shall be so.   Madness in great ones must not unwatch’d go.         [ Exeunt. ]          SCENE II. A hall in the  Castle.       Enter  Hamlet  and certain  Players .        HAMLET.   Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the  tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of your players do, I had as lief the  town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand,  thus, but use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,  whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it  smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated  fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the  groundlings, who, for the most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable  dumb shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipped for o’erdoing  Termagant. It out-Herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.        FIRST PLAYER.   I warrant your honour.         HAMLET.   Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your tutor. Suit the  action to the word, the word to the action, with this special observance, that  you o’erstep not the modesty of nature; for anything so overdone is from the  purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold  as ’twere the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, scorn her  own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now,  this overdone, or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot  but make the judicious grieve; the censure of the which one must in your  allowance o’erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I have  seen play—and heard others praise, and that highly—not to speak it profanely,  that, neither having the accent of Christians, nor the gait of Christian,  pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of  Nature’s journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated  humanity so abominably.        FIRST PLAYER.   I hope we have reform’d that indifferently with us, sir.         HAMLET.   O reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak no more than  is set down for them. For there be of them that will themselves laugh, to set  on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too, though in the meantime some  necessary question of the play be then to be considered. That’s villainous, and  shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go make you ready.        [ Exeunt  Players . ]        Enter  Polonius, Rosencrantz  and  Guildenstern .        How now, my lord?   Will the King hear this piece of work?        POLONIUS.   And the Queen too, and that presently.         HAMLET.   Bid the players make haste.         [ Exit  Polonius . ]        Will you two help to hasten them?        ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN.   We will, my lord.         [ Exeunt  Rosencrantz  and  Guildenstern . ]        HAMLET.   What ho, Horatio!         Enter  Horatio .        HORATIO.   Here, sweet lord, at your service.         HAMLET.   Horatio, thou art e’en as just a man   As e’er my conversation cop’d withal.         HORATIO.   O my dear lord.         HAMLET.   Nay, do not think I flatter;   For what advancement may I hope from thee,   That no revenue hast, but thy good spirits   To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter’d?   No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,   And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee   Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?   Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice,   And could of men distinguish, her election   Hath seal’d thee for herself. For thou hast been   As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,   A man that Fortune’s buffets and rewards   Hast ta’en with equal thanks. And blessed are those   Whose blood and judgement are so well co-mingled   That they are not a pipe for Fortune’s finger   To sound what stop she please. Give me that man   That is not passion’s slave, and I will wear him   In my heart’s core, ay, in my heart of heart,   As I do thee. Something too much of this.   There is a play tonight before the King.   One scene of it comes near the circumstance   Which I have told thee, of my father’s death.   I prithee, when thou see’st that act a-foot,   Even with the very comment of thy soul   Observe mine uncle. If his occulted guilt   Do not itself unkennel in one speech,   It is a damned ghost that we have seen;   And my imaginations are as foul   As Vulcan’s stithy. Give him heedful note;   For I mine eyes will rivet to his face;   And after we will both our judgements join   In censure of his seeming.         HORATIO.   Well, my lord.   If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,   And ’scape detecting, I will pay the theft.         HAMLET.   They are coming to the play. I must be idle.   Get you a place.         Danish march. A flourish. Enter  King, Queen, Polonius,  Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern  and others.        KING.   How fares our cousin Hamlet?         HAMLET.   Excellent, i’ faith; of the chameleon’s dish: I eat the air, promise-crammed:  you cannot feed capons so.        KING.   I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not mine.        HAMLET.   No, nor mine now. [ To Polonius. ] My lord, you play’d once i’  th’university, you say?        POLONIUS.   That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.         HAMLET.   What did you enact?         POLONIUS.   I did enact Julius Caesar. I was kill’d i’ th’ Capitol. Brutus killed me.        HAMLET.   It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be the players  ready?        ROSENCRANTZ.   Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.         QUEEN.   Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.         HAMLET.   No, good mother, here’s metal more attractive.         POLONIUS.   [ To the King. ] O ho! do you mark that?         HAMLET.   Lady, shall I lie in your lap?         [ Lying down at  Ophelia’s  feet. ]        OPHELIA.   No, my lord.         HAMLET.   I mean, my head upon your lap?         OPHELIA.   Ay, my lord.         HAMLET.   Do you think I meant country matters?         OPHELIA.   I think nothing, my lord.         HAMLET.   That’s a fair thought to lie between maids’ legs.         OPHELIA.   What is, my lord?         HAMLET.   Nothing.         OPHELIA.   You are merry, my lord.         HAMLET.   Who, I?         OPHELIA.   Ay, my lord.         HAMLET.   O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry? For look you how  cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within’s two hours.        OPHELIA.   Nay, ’tis twice two months, my lord.         HAMLET.   So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I’ll have a suit of sables. O  heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there’s hope a great  man’s memory may outlive his life half a year. But by’r lady, he must build  churches then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse,  whose epitaph is ‘For, O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!’        Trumpets sound. The dumb show enters.         Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him and he her.  She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her up, and  declines his head upon her neck. Lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She,  seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown,  kisses it, pours poison in the King’s ears, and exits. The Queen returns, finds  the King dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner with some three or  four Mutes, comes in again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is  carried away. The Poisoner woos the Queen with gifts. She seems loth and  unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love.         [ Exeunt. ]        OPHELIA.   What means this, my lord?         HAMLET.   Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.         OPHELIA.   Belike this show imports the argument of the play.         Enter  Prologue .        HAMLET.   We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot keep counsel; they’ll tell  all.        OPHELIA.   Will they tell us what this show meant?         HAMLET.   Ay, or any show that you’ll show him. Be not you ashamed to show, he’ll not  shame to tell you what it means.        OPHELIA.   You are naught, you are naught: I’ll mark the play.         PROLOGUE.       For us, and for our tragedy,      Here stooping to your clemency,      We beg your hearing patiently.          HAMLET.   Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?         OPHELIA.   ’Tis brief, my lord.         HAMLET.   As woman’s love.         Enter a  King  and a  Queen .        PLAYER KING.   Full thirty times hath Phoebus’ cart gone round   Neptune’s salt wash and Tellus’ orbed ground,   And thirty dozen moons with borrow’d sheen   About the world have times twelve thirties been,   Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands   Unite commutual in most sacred bands.         PLAYER QUEEN.   So many journeys may the sun and moon   Make us again count o’er ere love be done.   But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,   So far from cheer and from your former state,   That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,   Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:   For women’s fear and love holds quantity,   In neither aught, or in extremity.   Now what my love is, proof hath made you know,   And as my love is siz’d, my fear is so.   Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;   Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.         PLAYER KING.   Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too:   My operant powers their functions leave to do:   And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,   Honour’d, belov’d, and haply one as kind   For husband shalt thou—         PLAYER QUEEN.   O confound the rest.   Such love must needs be treason in my breast.   In second husband let me be accurst!   None wed the second but who kill’d the first.         HAMLET.   [ Aside. ] Wormwood, wormwood.         PLAYER QUEEN.   The instances that second marriage move   Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.   A second time I kill my husband dead,   When second husband kisses me in bed.         PLAYER KING.   I do believe you think what now you speak;   But what we do determine, oft we break.   Purpose is but the slave to memory,   Of violent birth, but poor validity:   Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,   But fall unshaken when they mellow be.   Most necessary ’tis that we forget   To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.   What to ourselves in passion we propose,   The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.   The violence of either grief or joy   Their own enactures with themselves destroy.   Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;   Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.   This world is not for aye; nor ’tis not strange   That even our loves should with our fortunes change,   For ’tis a question left us yet to prove,   Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.   The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,   The poor advanc’d makes friends of enemies;   And hitherto doth love on fortune tend:   For who not needs shall never lack a friend,   And who in want a hollow friend doth try,   Directly seasons him his enemy.   But orderly to end where I begun,   Our wills and fates do so contrary run   That our devices still are overthrown.   Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.   So think thou wilt no second husband wed,   But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.         PLAYER QUEEN.   Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,   Sport and repose lock from me day and night,   To desperation turn my trust and hope,   An anchor’s cheer in prison be my scope,   Each opposite that blanks the face of joy,   Meet what I would have well, and it destroy!   Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,   If, once a widow, ever I be wife.         HAMLET.   [ To Ophelia. ] If she should break it now.         PLAYER KING.   ’Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.   My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile   The tedious day with sleep.   [ Sleeps. ]         PLAYER QUEEN.   Sleep rock thy brain,   And never come mischance between us twain.         [ Exit. ]        HAMLET.   Madam, how like you this play?         QUEEN.   The lady protests too much, methinks.         HAMLET.   O, but she’ll keep her word.         KING.   Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in’t?         HAMLET.   No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i’ th’ world.        KING.   What do you call the play?         HAMLET.    The Mousetrap.  Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the image of a  murder done in Vienna. Gonzago is the Duke’s name, his wife Baptista: you shall  see anon; ’tis a knavish piece of work: but what o’ that? Your majesty, and we  that have free souls, it touches us not. Let the gall’d jade wince; our withers  are unwrung.        Enter  Lucianus .        This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.        OPHELIA.   You are a good chorus, my lord.         HAMLET.   I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see the puppets  dallying.        OPHELIA.   You are keen, my lord, you are keen.         HAMLET.   It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.         OPHELIA.   Still better, and worse.         HAMLET.   So you mistake your husbands.—Begin, murderer. Pox, leave thy damnable faces,  and begin. Come, the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.        LUCIANUS.   Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing,   Confederate season, else no creature seeing;   Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,   With Hecate’s ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,   Thy natural magic and dire property   On wholesome life usurp immediately.         [ Pours the poison into the sleeper’s ears. ]        HAMLET.   He poisons him i’ th’garden for’s estate. His name’s Gonzago. The story is  extant, and written in very choice Italian. You shall see anon how the murderer  gets the love of Gonzago’s wife.        OPHELIA.   The King rises.         HAMLET.   What, frighted with false fire?         QUEEN.   How fares my lord?         POLONIUS.   Give o’er the play.         KING.   Give me some light. Away.         All.   Lights, lights, lights.         [ Exeunt all but  Hamlet  and  Horatio . ]        HAMLET.      Why, let the strucken deer go weep,        The hart ungalled play;      For some must watch, while some must sleep,        So runs the world away.   Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers, if the rest of my fortunes turn  Turk with me; with two Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a fellowship  in a cry of players, sir?        HORATIO.   Half a share.         HAMLET.   A whole one, I.      For thou dost know, O Damon dear,        This realm dismantled was      Of Jove himself, and now reigns here        A very, very—pajock.         HORATIO.   You might have rhymed.         HAMLET.   O good Horatio, I’ll take the ghost’s word for a thousand pound. Didst  perceive?        HORATIO.   Very well, my lord.         HAMLET.   Upon the talk of the poisoning?         HORATIO.   I did very well note him.         HAMLET.   Ah, ha! Come, some music. Come, the recorders.      For if the king like not the comedy,      Why then, belike he likes it not, perdie.   Come, some music.         Enter  Rosencrantz  and  Guildenstern .        GUILDENSTERN.   Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.         HAMLET.   Sir, a whole history.         GUILDENSTERN.   The King, sir—         HAMLET.   Ay, sir, what of him?         GUILDENSTERN.   Is in his retirement, marvellous distempered.         HAMLET.   With drink, sir?         GUILDENSTERN.   No, my lord; rather with choler.         HAMLET.   Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to the doctor, for  me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far more choler.        GUILDENSTERN.   Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start not so wildly from  my affair.        HAMLET.   I am tame, sir, pronounce.         GUILDENSTERN.   The Queen your mother, in most great affliction of spirit, hath sent me to you.        HAMLET.   You are welcome.         GUILDENSTERN.   Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed. If it shall please  you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do your mother’s commandment; if not,  your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business.        HAMLET.   Sir, I cannot.         GUILDENSTERN.   What, my lord?         HAMLET.   Make you a wholesome answer. My wit’s diseased. But, sir, such answer as I can  make, you shall command; or rather, as you say, my mother. Therefore no more,  but to the matter. My mother, you say,—        ROSENCRANTZ.   Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into amazement and  admiration.        HAMLET.   O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is there no sequel at the  heels of this mother’s admiration?        ROSENCRANTZ.   She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.         HAMLET.   We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any further trade with  us?        ROSENCRANTZ.   My lord, you once did love me.         HAMLET.   And so I do still, by these pickers and stealers.         ROSENCRANTZ.   Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do surely bar the door upon  your own liberty if you deny your griefs to your friend.        HAMLET.   Sir, I lack advancement.         ROSENCRANTZ.   How can that be, when you have the voice of the King himself for your  succession in Denmark?        HAMLET.   Ay, sir, but while the grass grows—the proverb is something musty.        Re-enter the  Players  with recorders.        O, the recorders. Let me see one.—To withdraw with you, why do you go about to  recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me into a toil?        GUILDENSTERN.   O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.         HAMLET.   I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?         GUILDENSTERN.   My lord, I cannot.         HAMLET.   I pray you.         GUILDENSTERN.   Believe me, I cannot.         HAMLET.   I do beseech you.         GUILDENSTERN.   I know no touch of it, my lord.         HAMLET.   ’Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with your finger and thumb, give  it breath with your mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music. Look you,  these are the stops.        GUILDENSTERN.   But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony. I have not the skill.        HAMLET.   Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You would play upon me;  you would seem to know my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my mystery;  you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is  much music, excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it  speak. ’Sblood, do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me  what instrument you will, though you can fret me, you cannot play upon me.        Enter  Polonius .        God bless you, sir.        POLONIUS.   My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.         HAMLET.   Do you see yonder cloud that’s almost in shape of a camel?         POLONIUS.   By the mass, and ’tis like a camel indeed.         HAMLET.   Methinks it is like a weasel.         POLONIUS.   It is backed like a weasel.         HAMLET.   Or like a whale.         POLONIUS.   Very like a whale.         HAMLET.   Then will I come to my mother by and by.—They fool me to the top of my bent.—I  will come by and by.        POLONIUS.   I will say so.         [ Exit. ]        HAMLET.   By and by is easily said. Leave me, friends.        [ Exeunt all but  Hamlet . ]        ’Tis now the very witching time of night,   When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out   Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood,   And do such bitter business as the day   Would quake to look on. Soft now, to my mother.   O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever   The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:   Let me be cruel, not unnatural.   I will speak daggers to her, but use none;   My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites.   How in my words somever she be shent,   To give them seals never, my soul, consent.         [ Exit. ]          SCENE III. A room in the  Castle.       Enter  King, Rosencrantz  and  Guildenstern .        KING.   I like him not, nor stands it safe with us   To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you,   I your commission will forthwith dispatch,   And he to England shall along with you.   The terms of our estate may not endure   Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow   Out of his lunacies.         GUILDENSTERN.   We will ourselves provide.   Most holy and religious fear it is   To keep those many many bodies safe   That live and feed upon your Majesty.         ROSENCRANTZ.   The single and peculiar life is bound   With all the strength and armour of the mind,   To keep itself from ’noyance; but much more   That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest   The lives of many. The cease of majesty   Dies not alone; but like a gulf doth draw   What’s near it with it. It is a massy wheel   Fix’d on the summit of the highest mount,   To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things   Are mortis’d and adjoin’d; which when it falls,   Each small annexment, petty consequence,   Attends the boist’rous ruin. Never alone   Did the King sigh, but with a general groan.         KING.   Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;   For we will fetters put upon this fear,   Which now goes too free-footed.         ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN.   We will haste us.         [ Exeunt  Rosencrantz  and  Guildenstern . ]        Enter  Polonius .        POLONIUS.   My lord, he’s going to his mother’s closet.   Behind the arras I’ll convey myself   To hear the process. I’ll warrant she’ll tax him home,   And as you said, and wisely was it said,   ’Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,   Since nature makes them partial, should o’erhear   The speech of vantage. Fare you well, my liege,   I’ll call upon you ere you go to bed,   And tell you what I know.         KING.   Thanks, dear my lord.         [ Exit  Polonius . ]        O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;   It hath the primal eldest curse upon’t,—   A brother’s murder! Pray can I not,   Though inclination be as sharp as will:   My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,   And, like a man to double business bound,   I stand in pause where I shall first begin,   And both neglect. What if this cursed hand   Were thicker than itself with brother’s blood,   Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens   To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy   But to confront the visage of offence?   And what’s in prayer but this twofold force,   To be forestalled ere we come to fall,   Or pardon’d being down? Then I’ll look up.   My fault is past. But O, what form of prayer   Can serve my turn? Forgive me my foul murder!   That cannot be; since I am still possess’d   Of those effects for which I did the murder,—   My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.   May one be pardon’d and retain th’offence?   In the corrupted currents of this world   Offence’s gilded hand may shove by justice,   And oft ’tis seen the wicked prize itself   Buys out the law. But ’tis not so above;   There is no shuffling, there the action lies   In his true nature, and we ourselves compell’d   Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,   To give in evidence. What then? What rests?   Try what repentance can. What can it not?   Yet what can it, when one cannot repent?   O wretched state! O bosom black as death!   O limed soul, that struggling to be free,   Art more engag’d! Help, angels! Make assay:   Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,   Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe.   All may be well.         [ Retires and kneels. ]        Enter  Hamlet .        HAMLET.   Now might I do it pat, now he is praying.   And now I’ll do’t. And so he goes to heaven;   And so am I reveng’d. That would be scann’d:   A villain kills my father, and for that   I, his sole son, do this same villain send   To heaven. O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.   He took my father grossly, full of bread,   With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;   And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?   But in our circumstance and course of thought,   ’Tis heavy with him. And am I then reveng’d,   To take him in the purging of his soul,   When he is fit and season’d for his passage? No.   Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent:   When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage,   Or in th’incestuous pleasure of his bed,   At gaming, swearing; or about some act   That has no relish of salvation in’t,   Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,   And that his soul may be as damn’d and black   As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.   This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.         [ Exit. ]        The  King  rises and advances.        KING.   My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.   Words without thoughts never to heaven go.         [ Exit. ]          SCENE IV. Another room in  the Castle.       Enter  Queen  and  Polonius .        POLONIUS.   He will come straight. Look you lay home to him,   Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,   And that your Grace hath screen’d and stood between   Much heat and him. I’ll silence me e’en here.   Pray you be round with him.         HAMLET.   [ Within. ] Mother, mother, mother.         QUEEN.   I’ll warrant you, Fear me not.   Withdraw, I hear him coming.        [  Polonius  goes behind the arras. ]        Enter  Hamlet .        HAMLET.   Now, mother, what’s the matter?         QUEEN.   Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.         HAMLET.   Mother, you have my father much offended.         QUEEN.   Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.         HAMLET.   Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.         QUEEN.   Why, how now, Hamlet?         HAMLET.   What’s the matter now?         QUEEN.   Have you forgot me?         HAMLET.   No, by the rood, not so.   You are the Queen, your husband’s brother’s wife,   And, would it were not so. You are my mother.         QUEEN.   Nay, then I’ll set those to you that can speak.         HAMLET.   Come, come, and sit you down, you shall not budge.   You go not till I set you up a glass   Where you may see the inmost part of you.         QUEEN.   What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murder me?   Help, help, ho!         POLONIUS.   [ Behind. ] What, ho! help, help, help!         HAMLET.   How now? A rat? [ Draws. ]   Dead for a ducat, dead!         [ Makes a pass through the arras. ]        POLONIUS.   [ Behind. ] O, I am slain!         [ Falls and dies. ]        QUEEN.   O me, what hast thou done?         HAMLET.   Nay, I know not. Is it the King?         [ Draws forth  Polonius . ]        QUEEN.   O what a rash and bloody deed is this!         HAMLET.   A bloody deed. Almost as bad, good mother,   As kill a king and marry with his brother.         QUEEN.   As kill a king?         HAMLET.   Ay, lady, ’twas my word.—   [ To Polonius. ] Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!   I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune,   Thou find’st to be too busy is some danger.—   Leave wringing of your hands. Peace, sit you down,   And let me wring your heart, for so I shall,   If it be made of penetrable stuff;   If damned custom have not braz’d it so,   That it is proof and bulwark against sense.         QUEEN.   What have I done, that thou dar’st wag thy tongue   In noise so rude against me?         HAMLET.   Such an act   That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,   Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose   From the fair forehead of an innocent love,   And sets a blister there. Makes marriage vows   As false as dicers’ oaths. O such a deed   As from the body of contraction plucks   The very soul, and sweet religion makes   A rhapsody of words. Heaven’s face doth glow,   Yea this solidity and compound mass,   With tristful visage, as against the doom,   Is thought-sick at the act.         QUEEN.   Ay me, what act,   That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?         HAMLET.   Look here upon this picture, and on this,   The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.   See what a grace was seated on this brow,   Hyperion’s curls, the front of Jove himself,   An eye like Mars, to threaten and command,   A station like the herald Mercury   New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:   A combination and a form indeed,   Where every god did seem to set his seal,   To give the world assurance of a man.   This was your husband. Look you now what follows.   Here is your husband, like a mildew’d ear   Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?   Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,   And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?   You cannot call it love; for at your age   The hey-day in the blood is tame, it’s humble,   And waits upon the judgement: and what judgement   Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,   Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense   Is apoplex’d, for madness would not err   Nor sense to ecstacy was ne’er so thrall’d   But it reserv’d some quantity of choice   To serve in such a difference. What devil was’t   That thus hath cozen’d you at hoodman-blind?   Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,   Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,   Or but a sickly part of one true sense   Could not so mope. O shame! where is thy blush?   Rebellious hell,   If thou canst mutine in a matron’s bones,   To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,   And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame   When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,   Since frost itself as actively doth burn,   And reason panders will.         QUEEN.   O Hamlet, speak no more.   Thou turn’st mine eyes into my very soul,   And there I see such black and grained spots   As will not leave their tinct.         HAMLET.   Nay, but to live   In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,   Stew’d in corruption, honeying and making love   Over the nasty sty.         QUEEN.   O speak to me no more;   These words like daggers enter in mine ears;   No more, sweet Hamlet.         HAMLET.   A murderer and a villain;   A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe   Of your precedent lord. A vice of kings,   A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,   That from a shelf the precious diadem stole   And put it in his pocket!         QUEEN.   No more.         HAMLET.   A king of shreds and patches!—         Enter  Ghost .        Save me and hover o’er me with your wings,   You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?         QUEEN.   Alas, he’s mad.         HAMLET.   Do you not come your tardy son to chide,   That, laps’d in time and passion, lets go by   The important acting of your dread command?   O say!         GHOST.   Do not forget. This visitation   Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.   But look, amazement on thy mother sits.   O step between her and her fighting soul.   Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.   Speak to her, Hamlet.         HAMLET.   How is it with you, lady?         QUEEN.   Alas, how is’t with you,   That you do bend your eye on vacancy,   And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?   Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep,   And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,   Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,   Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,   Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper   Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?         HAMLET.   On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares,   His form and cause conjoin’d, preaching to stones,   Would make them capable.—Do not look upon me,   Lest with this piteous action you convert   My stern effects. Then what I have to do   Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.         QUEEN.   To whom do you speak this?         HAMLET.   Do you see nothing there?         QUEEN.   Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.         HAMLET.   Nor did you nothing hear?         QUEEN.   No, nothing but ourselves.         HAMLET.   Why, look you there! look how it steals away!   My father, in his habit as he liv’d!   Look where he goes even now out at the portal.         [ Exit  Ghost . ]        QUEEN.   This is the very coinage of your brain.   This bodiless creation ecstasy   Is very cunning in.         HAMLET.   Ecstasy!   My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time,   And makes as healthful music. It is not madness   That I have utter’d. Bring me to the test,   And I the matter will re-word; which madness   Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,   Lay not that flattering unction to your soul   That not your trespass, but my madness speaks.   It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,   Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,   Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven,   Repent what’s past, avoid what is to come;   And do not spread the compost on the weeds,   To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;   For in the fatness of these pursy times   Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,   Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.         QUEEN.   O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.         HAMLET.   O throw away the worser part of it,   And live the purer with the other half.   Good night. But go not to mine uncle’s bed.   Assume a virtue, if you have it not.   That monster custom, who all sense doth eat,   Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,   That to the use of actions fair and good   He likewise gives a frock or livery   That aptly is put on. Refrain tonight,   And that shall lend a kind of easiness   To the next abstinence. The next more easy;   For use almost can change the stamp of nature,   And either curb the devil, or throw him out   With wondrous potency. Once more, good night,   And when you are desirous to be bles’d,   I’ll blessing beg of you. For this same lord   [ Pointing to Polonius. ]   I do repent; but heaven hath pleas’d it so,   To punish me with this, and this with me,   That I must be their scourge and minister.   I will bestow him, and will answer well   The death I gave him. So again, good night.   I must be cruel, only to be kind:   Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.   One word more, good lady.         QUEEN.   What shall I do?         HAMLET.   Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:   Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed,   Pinch wanton on your cheek, call you his mouse,   And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,   Or paddling in your neck with his damn’d fingers,   Make you to ravel all this matter out,   That I essentially am not in madness,   But mad in craft. ’Twere good you let him know,   For who that’s but a queen, fair, sober, wise,   Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,   Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?   No, in despite of sense and secrecy,   Unpeg the basket on the house’s top,   Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,   To try conclusions, in the basket creep   And break your own neck down.         QUEEN.   Be thou assur’d, if words be made of breath,   And breath of life, I have no life to breathe   What thou hast said to me.         HAMLET.   I must to England, you know that?         QUEEN.   Alack,   I had forgot. ’Tis so concluded on.         HAMLET.   There’s letters seal’d: and my two schoolfellows,   Whom I will trust as I will adders fang’d,—   They bear the mandate, they must sweep my way   And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;   For ’tis the sport to have the enginer   Hoist with his own petard, and ’t shall go hard   But I will delve one yard below their mines   And blow them at the moon. O, ’tis most sweet,   When in one line two crafts directly meet.   This man shall set me packing.   I’ll lug the guts into the neighbour room.   Mother, good night. Indeed, this counsellor   Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,   Who was in life a foolish prating knave.   Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.   Good night, mother.         [ Exit  Hamlet  dragging out  Polonius . ]                 ACT IV       SCENE I. A room in the Castle.       Enter  King, Queen, Rosencrantz  and  Guildenstern .        KING.   There’s matter in these sighs. These profound heaves   You must translate; ’tis fit we understand them.   Where is your son?         QUEEN.   Bestow this place on us a little while.         [ To  Rosencrantz  and  Guildenstern,  who go out. ]        Ah, my good lord, what have I seen tonight!        KING.   What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?         QUEEN.   Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend   Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit   Behind the arras hearing something stir,   Whips out his rapier, cries ‘A rat, a rat!’   And in this brainish apprehension kills   The unseen good old man.         KING.   O heavy deed!   It had been so with us, had we been there.   His liberty is full of threats to all;   To you yourself, to us, to everyone.   Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer’d?   It will be laid to us, whose providence   Should have kept short, restrain’d, and out of haunt   This mad young man. But so much was our love   We would not understand what was most fit,   But like the owner of a foul disease,   To keep it from divulging, let it feed   Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?         QUEEN.   To draw apart the body he hath kill’d,   O’er whom his very madness, like some ore   Among a mineral of metals base,   Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.         KING.   O Gertrude, come away!   The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch   But we will ship him hence, and this vile deed   We must with all our majesty and skill   Both countenance and excuse.—Ho, Guildenstern!         Re-enter  Rosencrantz  and  Guildenstern .        Friends both, go join you with some further aid:   Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,   And from his mother’s closet hath he dragg’d him.   Go seek him out, speak fair, and bring the body   Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.         [ Exeunt  Rosencrantz  and  Guildenstern . ]        Come, Gertrude, we’ll call up our wisest friends,   And let them know both what we mean to do   And what’s untimely done, so haply slander,   Whose whisper o’er the world’s diameter,   As level as the cannon to his blank,   Transports his poison’d shot, may miss our name,   And hit the woundless air. O, come away!   My soul is full of discord and dismay.         [ Exeunt. ]          SCENE II. Another room in  the Castle.       Enter  Hamlet .        HAMLET.   Safely stowed.         ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN.   [ Within. ] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!         HAMLET.   What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.         Enter  Rosencrantz  and  Guildenstern .        ROSENCRANTZ.   What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?         HAMLET.   Compounded it with dust, whereto ’tis kin.         ROSENCRANTZ.   Tell us where ’tis, that we may take it thence,   And bear it to the chapel.         HAMLET.   Do not believe it.         ROSENCRANTZ.   Believe what?         HAMLET.   That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be demanded of a  sponge—what replication should be made by the son of a king?        ROSENCRANTZ.   Take you me for a sponge, my lord?         HAMLET.   Ay, sir; that soaks up the King’s countenance, his rewards, his authorities.  But such officers do the King best service in the end: he keeps them, like an  ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to be last swallowed: when he  needs what you have gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you shall be  dry again.        ROSENCRANTZ.   I understand you not, my lord.         HAMLET.   I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.         ROSENCRANTZ.   My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the King.        HAMLET.   The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body. The King is a  thing—        GUILDENSTERN.   A thing, my lord!         HAMLET.   Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.         [ Exeunt. ]          SCENE III. Another room in  the Castle.       Enter  King,  attended.        KING.   I have sent to seek him and to find the body.   How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!   Yet must not we put the strong law on him:   He’s lov’d of the distracted multitude,   Who like not in their judgement, but their eyes;   And where ’tis so, th’offender’s scourge is weigh’d,   But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,   This sudden sending him away must seem   Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown   By desperate appliance are reliev’d,   Or not at all.         Enter  Rosencrantz .        How now? What hath befall’n?        ROSENCRANTZ.   Where the dead body is bestow’d, my lord,   We cannot get from him.         KING.   But where is he?         ROSENCRANTZ.   Without, my lord, guarded, to know your pleasure.         KING.   Bring him before us.         ROSENCRANTZ.   Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.         Enter  Hamlet  and  Guildenstern .        KING.   Now, Hamlet, where’s Polonius?         HAMLET.   At supper.         KING.   At supper? Where?         HAMLET.   Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain convocation of politic  worms are e’en at him. Your worm is your only emperor for diet. We fat all  creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and  your lean beggar is but variable service,—two dishes, but to one table. That’s  the end.        KING.   Alas, alas!         HAMLET.   A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat of the fish that  hath fed of that worm.        KING.   What dost thou mean by this?         HAMLET.   Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a  beggar.        KING.   Where is Polonius?         HAMLET.   In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not there, seek him  i’ th’other place yourself. But indeed, if you find him not within this month,  you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby.        KING.   [ To some Attendants. ] Go seek him there.         HAMLET.   He will stay till you come.         [ Exeunt  Attendants . ]        KING.   Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,—   Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve   For that which thou hast done,—must send thee hence   With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself;   The bark is ready, and the wind at help,   Th’associates tend, and everything is bent   For England.         HAMLET.   For England?         KING.   Ay, Hamlet.         HAMLET.   Good.         KING.   So is it, if thou knew’st our purposes.         HAMLET.   I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for England! Farewell, dear mother.        KING.   Thy loving father, Hamlet.         HAMLET.   My mother. Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is one flesh; and  so, my mother. Come, for England.        [ Exit. ]        KING.   Follow him at foot. Tempt him with speed aboard;   Delay it not; I’ll have him hence tonight.   Away, for everything is seal’d and done   That else leans on th’affair. Pray you make haste.         [ Exeunt  Rosencrantz  and  Guildenstern . ]        And England, if my love thou hold’st at aught,—   As my great power thereof may give thee sense,   Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red   After the Danish sword, and thy free awe   Pays homage to us,—thou mayst not coldly set   Our sovereign process, which imports at full,   By letters conjuring to that effect,   The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;   For like the hectic in my blood he rages,   And thou must cure me. Till I know ’tis done,   Howe’er my haps, my joys were ne’er begun.         [ Exit. ]          SCENE IV. A plain in  Denmark.       Enter  Fortinbras  and  Forces  marching.        FORTINBRAS.   Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.   Tell him that by his license, Fortinbras   Craves the conveyance of a promis’d march   Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.   If that his Majesty would aught with us,   We shall express our duty in his eye;   And let him know so.         CAPTAIN.   I will do’t, my lord.         FORTINBRAS.   Go softly on.         [ Exeunt all but the  Captain . ]        Enter  Hamlet, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern &amp;c .        HAMLET.   Good sir, whose powers are these?         CAPTAIN.   They are of Norway, sir.         HAMLET.   How purpos’d, sir, I pray you?         CAPTAIN.   Against some part of Poland.         HAMLET.   Who commands them, sir?         CAPTAIN.   The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.         HAMLET.   Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,   Or for some frontier?         CAPTAIN.   Truly to speak, and with no addition,   We go to gain a little patch of ground   That hath in it no profit but the name.   To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;   Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole   A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.         HAMLET.   Why, then the Polack never will defend it.         CAPTAIN.   Yes, it is already garrison’d.         HAMLET.   Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats   Will not debate the question of this straw!   This is th’imposthume of much wealth and peace,   That inward breaks, and shows no cause without   Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.         CAPTAIN.   God b’ wi’ you, sir.         [ Exit. ]        ROSENCRANTZ.   Will’t please you go, my lord?         HAMLET.   I’ll be with you straight. Go a little before.         [ Exeunt all but  Hamlet . ]        How all occasions do inform against me,   And spur my dull revenge. What is a man   If his chief good and market of his time   Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.   Sure he that made us with such large discourse,   Looking before and after, gave us not   That capability and godlike reason   To fust in us unus’d. Now whether it be   Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple   Of thinking too precisely on th’event,—   A thought which, quarter’d, hath but one part wisdom   And ever three parts coward,—I do not know   Why yet I live to say this thing’s to do,   Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means   To do’t. Examples gross as earth exhort me,   Witness this army of such mass and charge,   Led by a delicate and tender prince,   Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff’d,   Makes mouths at the invisible event,   Exposing what is mortal and unsure   To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,   Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great   Is not to stir without great argument,   But greatly to find quarrel in a straw   When honour’s at the stake. How stand I then,   That have a father kill’d, a mother stain’d,   Excitements of my reason and my blood,   And let all sleep, while to my shame I see   The imminent death of twenty thousand men   That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,   Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot   Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,   Which is not tomb enough and continent   To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,   My thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth.         [ Exit. ]          SCENE V. Elsinore. A room in  the Castle.       Enter  Queen, Horatio  and a  Gentleman .        QUEEN.   I will not speak with her.         GENTLEMAN.   She is importunate, indeed distract.   Her mood will needs be pitied.         QUEEN.   What would she have?         GENTLEMAN.   She speaks much of her father; says she hears   There’s tricks i’ th’ world, and hems, and beats her heart,   Spurns enviously at straws, speaks things in doubt,   That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,   Yet the unshaped use of it doth move   The hearers to collection; they aim at it,   And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts,   Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures yield them,   Indeed would make one think there might be thought,   Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.   ’Twere good she were spoken with, for she may strew   Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.         QUEEN.   Let her come in.         [ Exit  Gentleman . ]        To my sick soul, as sin’s true nature is,   Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss.   So full of artless jealousy is guilt,   It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.         Enter  Ophelia .        OPHELIA.   Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?         QUEEN.   How now, Ophelia?         OPHELIA.   [ Sings. ]      How should I your true love know        From another one?      By his cockle hat and staff        And his sandal shoon.         QUEEN.   Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?         OPHELIA.   Say you? Nay, pray you mark.   [ Sings. ]      He is dead and gone, lady,        He is dead and gone,      At his head a grass green turf,        At his heels a stone.         QUEEN.   Nay, but Ophelia—         OPHELIA.   Pray you mark.   [ Sings. ]      White his shroud as the mountain snow.         Enter  King .        QUEEN.   Alas, look here, my lord!         OPHELIA.   [ Sings. ]        Larded all with sweet flowers;      Which bewept to the grave did not go        With true-love showers.         KING.   How do you, pretty lady?         OPHELIA.   Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker’s daughter. Lord, we know what  we are, but know not what we may be. God be at your table!        KING.   Conceit upon her father.         OPHELIA.   Pray you, let’s have no words of this; but when they ask you what it means, say  you this:   [ Sings. ]      Tomorrow is Saint Valentine’s day,        All in the morning betime,      And I a maid at your window,        To be your Valentine.            Then up he rose and donn’d his clothes,        And dupp’d the chamber door,      Let in the maid, that out a maid        Never departed more.         KING.   Pretty Ophelia!         OPHELIA.   Indeed la, without an oath, I’ll make an end on’t.   [ Sings. ]      By Gis and by Saint Charity,        Alack, and fie for shame!      Young men will do’t if they come to’t;        By Cock, they are to blame.            Quoth she, before you tumbled me,        You promis’d me to wed.      So would I ha’ done, by yonder sun,        An thou hadst not come to my bed.         KING.   How long hath she been thus?         OPHELIA.   I hope all will be well. We must be patient. But I cannot choose but weep, to  think they would lay him i’ th’ cold ground. My brother shall know of it. And  so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies; good  night, sweet ladies; good night, good night.        [ Exit. ]        KING.   Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.         [ Exit  Horatio . ]        O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs   All from her father’s death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,   When sorrows come, they come not single spies,   But in battalions. First, her father slain;   Next, your son gone; and he most violent author   Of his own just remove; the people muddied,   Thick, and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers   For good Polonius’ death; and we have done but greenly   In hugger-mugger to inter him. Poor Ophelia   Divided from herself and her fair judgement,   Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts.   Last, and as much containing as all these,   Her brother is in secret come from France,   Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,   And wants not buzzers to infect his ear   With pestilent speeches of his father’s death,   Wherein necessity, of matter beggar’d,   Will nothing stick our person to arraign   In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,   Like to a murdering piece, in many places   Gives me superfluous death.         [ A noise within. ]        QUEEN.   Alack, what noise is this?         KING.   Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.        Enter a  Gentleman .        What is the matter?        GENTLEMAN.   Save yourself, my lord.   The ocean, overpeering of his list,   Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste   Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,   O’erbears your offices. The rabble call him lord,   And, as the world were now but to begin,   Antiquity forgot, custom not known,   The ratifiers and props of every word,   They cry ‘Choose we! Laertes shall be king!’   Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,   ‘Laertes shall be king, Laertes king.’         QUEEN.   How cheerfully on the false trail they cry.   O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs.         [ A noise within. ]        KING.   The doors are broke.         Enter  Laertes,  armed;  Danes  following.        LAERTES.   Where is this king?—Sirs, stand you all without.         Danes.   No, let’s come in.         LAERTES.   I pray you, give me leave.         DANES.   We will, we will.         [ They retire without the door. ]        LAERTES.   I thank you. Keep the door. O thou vile king,   Give me my father.         QUEEN.   Calmly, good Laertes.         LAERTES.   That drop of blood that’s calm proclaims me bastard;   Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot   Even here between the chaste unsmirched brow   Of my true mother.         KING.   What is the cause, Laertes,   That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?—   Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.   There’s such divinity doth hedge a king,   That treason can but peep to what it would,   Acts little of his will.—Tell me, Laertes,   Why thou art thus incens’d.—Let him go, Gertrude:—   Speak, man.         LAERTES.   Where is my father?         KING.   Dead.         QUEEN.   But not by him.         KING.   Let him demand his fill.         LAERTES.   How came he dead? I’ll not be juggled with.   To hell, allegiance! Vows, to the blackest devil!   Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!   I dare damnation. To this point I stand,   That both the worlds, I give to negligence,   Let come what comes; only I’ll be reveng’d   Most throughly for my father.         KING.   Who shall stay you?         LAERTES.   My will, not all the world.   And for my means, I’ll husband them so well,   They shall go far with little.         KING.   Good Laertes,   If you desire to know the certainty   Of your dear father’s death, is’t writ in your revenge   That, sweepstake, you will draw both friend and foe,   Winner and loser?         LAERTES.   None but his enemies.         KING.   Will you know them then?         LAERTES.   To his good friends thus wide I’ll ope my arms;   And, like the kind life-rendering pelican,   Repast them with my blood.         KING.   Why, now you speak   Like a good child and a true gentleman.   That I am guiltless of your father’s death,   And am most sensibly in grief for it,   It shall as level to your judgement ’pear   As day does to your eye.         DANES.   [ Within. ] Let her come in.         LAERTES.   How now! What noise is that?         Re-enter  Ophelia,  fantastically dressed with  straws and flowers.        O heat, dry up my brains. Tears seven times salt,   Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye.   By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,   Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!   Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!   O heavens, is’t possible a young maid’s wits   Should be as mortal as an old man’s life?   Nature is fine in love, and where ’tis fine,   It sends some precious instance of itself   After the thing it loves.         OPHELIA.   [ Sings. ]      They bore him barefac’d on the bier,      Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny      And on his grave rain’d many a tear.—      Fare you well, my dove!        LAERTES.   Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,   It could not move thus.         OPHELIA.   You must sing ‘Down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.’ O, how the wheel  becomes it! It is the false steward that stole his master’s daughter.        LAERTES.   This nothing’s more than matter.         OPHELIA.   There’s rosemary, that’s for remembrance; pray love, remember. And there is  pansies, that’s for thoughts.        LAERTES.   A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.         OPHELIA.   There’s fennel for you, and columbines. There’s rue for you; and here’s some  for me. We may call it herb of grace o’ Sundays. O you must wear your rue with  a difference. There’s a daisy. I would give you some violets, but they wither’d  all when my father died. They say he made a good end.   [ Sings. ]      For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.        LAERTES.   Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself   She turns to favour and to prettiness.         OPHELIA.   [ Sings. ]      And will he not come again?      And will he not come again?        No, no, he is dead,        Go to thy death-bed,      He never will come again.            His beard was as white as snow,      All flaxen was his poll.        He is gone, he is gone,        And we cast away moan.      God ha’ mercy on his soul.         And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b’ wi’ ye.        [ Exit. ]        LAERTES.   Do you see this, O God?         KING.   Laertes, I must commune with your grief,   Or you deny me right. Go but apart,   Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,   And they shall hear and judge ’twixt you and me.   If by direct or by collateral hand   They find us touch’d, we will our kingdom give,   Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours   To you in satisfaction; but if not,   Be you content to lend your patience to us,   And we shall jointly labour with your soul   To give it due content.         LAERTES.   Let this be so;   His means of death, his obscure burial,—   No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o’er his bones,   No noble rite, nor formal ostentation,—   Cry to be heard, as ’twere from heaven to earth,   That I must call’t in question.         KING.   So you shall.   And where th’offence is let the great axe fall.   I pray you go with me.         [ Exeunt. ]          SCENE VI. Another room in  the Castle.       Enter  Horatio  and a  Servant .        HORATIO.   What are they that would speak with me?         SERVANT.   Sailors, sir. They say they have letters for you.         HORATIO.   Let them come in.         [ Exit  Servant . ]        I do not know from what part of the world   I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.         Enter  Sailors .        FIRST SAILOR.   God bless you, sir.         HORATIO.   Let him bless thee too.         FIRST SAILOR.   He shall, sir, and’t please him. There’s a letter for you, sir. It comes from  th’ambassador that was bound for England; if your name be Horatio, as I am let  to know it is.        HORATIO.   [ Reads. ] ‘Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked this, give these  fellows some means to the King. They have letters for him. Ere we were two days  old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding  ourselves too slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the grapple I  boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our ship, so I alone became  their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves of mercy. But they knew  what they did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the King have the letters I  have sent, and repair thou to me with as much haste as thou wouldst fly death.  I have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too  light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring thee where I  am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for England: of them I have  much to tell thee. Farewell.        He that thou knowest thine,        HAMLET.’        Come, I will give you way for these your letters,   And do’t the speedier, that you may direct me   To him from whom you brought them.         [ Exeunt. ]          SCENE VII. Another room in  the Castle.       Enter  King  and  Laertes .        KING.   Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,   And you must put me in your heart for friend,   Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,   That he which hath your noble father slain   Pursu’d my life.         LAERTES.   It well appears. But tell me   Why you proceeded not against these feats,   So crimeful and so capital in nature,   As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,   You mainly were stirr’d up.         KING.   O, for two special reasons,   Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew’d,   But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother   Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,—   My virtue or my plague, be it either which,—   She’s so conjunctive to my life and soul,   That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,   I could not but by her. The other motive,   Why to a public count I might not go,   Is the great love the general gender bear him,   Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,   Would like the spring that turneth wood to stone,   Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,   Too slightly timber’d for so loud a wind,   Would have reverted to my bow again,   And not where I had aim’d them.         LAERTES.   And so have I a noble father lost,   A sister driven into desperate terms,   Whose worth, if praises may go back again,   Stood challenger on mount of all the age   For her perfections. But my revenge will come.         KING.   Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think   That we are made of stuff so flat and dull   That we can let our beard be shook with danger,   And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.   I lov’d your father, and we love ourself,   And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine—         Enter a  Messenger .        How now? What news?        MESSENGER.   Letters, my lord, from Hamlet.   This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.         KING.   From Hamlet! Who brought them?         MESSENGER.   Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.   They were given me by Claudio. He receiv’d them   Of him that brought them.         KING.   Laertes, you shall hear them.   Leave us.         [ Exit  Messenger . ]        [ Reads. ] ‘High and mighty, you shall know I am set naked on your  kingdom. Tomorrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes. When I shall,  first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the occasions of my sudden and more  strange return.        HAMLET.’        What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?   Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?         LAERTES.   Know you the hand?         KING.   ’Tis Hamlet’s character. ‘Naked!’   And in a postscript here he says ‘alone.’   Can you advise me?         LAERTES.   I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come,   It warms the very sickness in my heart   That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,   ‘Thus diest thou.’         KING.   If it be so, Laertes,—   As how should it be so? How otherwise?—   Will you be rul’d by me?         LAERTES.   Ay, my lord;   So you will not o’errule me to a peace.         KING.   To thine own peace. If he be now return’d,   As checking at his voyage, and that he means   No more to undertake it, I will work him   To an exploit, now ripe in my device,   Under the which he shall not choose but fall;   And for his death no wind shall breathe,   But even his mother shall uncharge the practice   And call it accident.         LAERTES.   My lord, I will be rul’d;   The rather if you could devise it so   That I might be the organ.         KING.   It falls right.   You have been talk’d of since your travel much,   And that in Hamlet’s hearing, for a quality   Wherein they say you shine. Your sum of parts   Did not together pluck such envy from him   As did that one, and that, in my regard,   Of the unworthiest siege.         LAERTES.   What part is that, my lord?         KING.   A very riband in the cap of youth,   Yet needful too, for youth no less becomes   The light and careless livery that it wears   Than settled age his sables and his weeds,   Importing health and graveness. Two months since   Here was a gentleman of Normandy,—   I’ve seen myself, and serv’d against, the French,   And they can well on horseback, but this gallant   Had witchcraft in’t. He grew unto his seat,   And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,   As had he been incorps’d and demi-natur’d   With the brave beast. So far he topp’d my thought   That I in forgery of shapes and tricks,   Come short of what he did.         LAERTES.   A Norman was’t?         KING.   A Norman.         LAERTES.   Upon my life, Lamord.         KING.   The very same.         LAERTES.   I know him well. He is the brooch indeed   And gem of all the nation.         KING.   He made confession of you,   And gave you such a masterly report   For art and exercise in your defence,   And for your rapier most especially,   That he cried out ’twould be a sight indeed   If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation   He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,   If you oppos’d them. Sir, this report of his   Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy   That he could nothing do but wish and beg   Your sudden coming o’er to play with him.   Now, out of this,—         LAERTES.   What out of this, my lord?         KING.   Laertes, was your father dear to you?   Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,   A face without a heart?         LAERTES.   Why ask you this?         KING.   Not that I think you did not love your father,   But that I know love is begun by time,   And that I see, in passages of proof,   Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.   There lives within the very flame of love   A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;   And nothing is at a like goodness still,   For goodness, growing to a pleurisy,   Dies in his own too much. That we would do,   We should do when we would; for this ‘would’ changes,   And hath abatements and delays as many   As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;   And then this ‘should’ is like a spendthrift sigh   That hurts by easing. But to the quick o’ th’ulcer:   Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake   To show yourself your father’s son in deed,   More than in words?         LAERTES.   To cut his throat i’ th’ church.         KING.   No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;   Revenge should have no bounds. But good Laertes,   Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.   Hamlet return’d shall know you are come home:   We’ll put on those shall praise your excellence,   And set a double varnish on the fame   The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together   And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,   Most generous, and free from all contriving,   Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,   Or with a little shuffling, you may choose   A sword unbated, and in a pass of practice,   Requite him for your father.         LAERTES.   I will do’t.   And for that purpose I’ll anoint my sword.   I bought an unction of a mountebank   So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,   Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,   Collected from all simples that have virtue   Under the moon, can save the thing from death   This is but scratch’d withal. I’ll touch my point   With this contagion, that if I gall him slightly,   It may be death.         KING.   Let’s further think of this,   Weigh what convenience both of time and means   May fit us to our shape. If this should fail,   And that our drift look through our bad performance.   ’Twere better not assay’d. Therefore this project   Should have a back or second, that might hold   If this did blast in proof. Soft, let me see.   We’ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings,—   I ha’t! When in your motion you are hot and dry,   As make your bouts more violent to that end,   And that he calls for drink, I’ll have prepar’d him   A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,   If he by chance escape your venom’d stuck,   Our purpose may hold there.         Enter  Queen .        How now, sweet Queen?        QUEEN.   One woe doth tread upon another’s heel,   So fast they follow. Your sister’s drown’d, Laertes.         LAERTES.   Drown’d! O, where?         QUEEN.   There is a willow grows aslant a brook,   That shows his hoary leaves in the glassy stream.   There with fantastic garlands did she make   Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,   That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,   But our cold maids do dead men’s fingers call them.   There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds   Clamb’ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,   When down her weedy trophies and herself   Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide,   And mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up,   Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,   As one incapable of her own distress,   Or like a creature native and indued   Unto that element. But long it could not be   Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,   Pull’d the poor wretch from her melodious lay   To muddy death.         LAERTES.   Alas, then she is drown’d?         QUEEN.   Drown’d, drown’d.         LAERTES.   Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,   And therefore I forbid my tears. But yet   It is our trick; nature her custom holds,   Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,   The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord,   I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,   But that this folly douts it.         [ Exit. ]        KING.   Let’s follow, Gertrude;   How much I had to do to calm his rage!   Now fear I this will give it start again;   Therefore let’s follow.         [ Exeunt. ]                 ACT V       SCENE I. A churchyard.       Enter two  Clowns  with spades, &amp;c.        FIRST CLOWN.   Is she to be buried in Christian burial, when she wilfully seeks her own  salvation?        SECOND CLOWN.   I tell thee she is, and therefore make her grave straight. The crowner hath sat  on her, and finds it Christian burial.        FIRST CLOWN.   How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence?        SECOND CLOWN.   Why, ’tis found so.        FIRST CLOWN.   It must be  se offendendo , it cannot be else. For here lies the point: if  I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and an act hath three branches. It  is to act, to do, and to perform: argal, she drowned herself wittingly.        SECOND CLOWN.   Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,—        FIRST CLOWN.   Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands the man; good. If the man  go to this water and drown himself, it is, will he nill he, he goes,—mark you  that. But if the water come to him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal,  he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.        SECOND CLOWN.   But is this law?        FIRST CLOWN.   Ay, marry, is’t, crowner’s quest law.        SECOND CLOWN.   Will you ha’ the truth on’t? If this had not been a gentlewoman, she should  have been buried out o’ Christian burial.        FIRST CLOWN.   Why, there thou say’st. And the more pity that great folk should have  countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves more than their even  Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient gentlemen but gardeners,  ditchers, and grave-makers: they hold up Adam’s profession.        SECOND CLOWN.   Was he a gentleman?        FIRST CLOWN.   He was the first that ever bore arms.        SECOND CLOWN.   Why, he had none.        FIRST CLOWN.   What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture? The Scripture says  Adam digg’d. Could he dig without arms? I’ll put another question to thee. If  thou answerest me not to the purpose, confess thyself—        SECOND CLOWN.   Go to.        FIRST CLOWN.   What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright, or the  carpenter?        SECOND CLOWN.   The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.        FIRST CLOWN.   I like thy wit well in good faith, the gallows does well. But how does it well?  It does well to those that do ill. Now, thou dost ill to say the gallows is  built stronger than the church; argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To’t  again, come.        SECOND CLOWN.   Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?        FIRST CLOWN.   Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.        SECOND CLOWN.   Marry, now I can tell.        FIRST CLOWN.   To’t.        SECOND CLOWN.   Mass, I cannot tell.        Enter  Hamlet  and  Horatio , at a distance.        FIRST CLOWN.   Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will not mend his pace  with beating; and when you are asked this question next, say ‘a grave-maker’.  The houses he makes last till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a  stoup of liquor.        [ Exit  Second Clown . ]        [ Digs and sings. ]           In youth when I did love, did love,        Methought it was very sweet;      To contract, O, the time for, a, my behove,        O methought there was nothing meet.         HAMLET.   Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at grave-making?        HORATIO.   Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.         HAMLET.   ’Tis e’en so; the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense.        FIRST CLOWN.   [ Sings. ]      But age with his stealing steps        Hath claw’d me in his clutch,      And hath shipp’d me into the land,        As if I had never been such.         [ Throws up a skull. ]        HAMLET.   That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the knave jowls it to  th’ ground, as if ’twere Cain’s jawbone, that did the first murder! This might  be the pate of a politician which this ass now o’er-offices, one that would  circumvent God, might it not?        HORATIO.   It might, my lord.         HAMLET.   Or of a courtier, which could say ‘Good morrow, sweet lord! How dost thou, good  lord?’ This might be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord such-a-one’s  horse when he meant to beg it, might it not?        HORATIO.   Ay, my lord.         HAMLET.   Why, e’en so: and now my Lady Worm’s; chapless, and knocked about the mazard  with a sexton’s spade. Here’s fine revolution, an we had the trick to see’t.  Did these bones cost no more the breeding but to play at loggets with ’em? Mine  ache to think on’t.        FIRST CLOWN.   [ Sings. ]      A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,        For and a shrouding-sheet;      O, a pit of clay for to be made        For such a guest is meet.         [ Throws up another skull. ]        HAMLET.   There’s another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer? Where be his  quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? Why does he  suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel,  and will not tell him of his action of battery? Hum. This fellow might be in’s  time a great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his fines,  his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine of his fines, and the  recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt? Will his  vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than the  length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands  will scarcely lie in this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?        HORATIO.   Not a jot more, my lord.         HAMLET.   Is not parchment made of sheep-skins?         HORATIO.   Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.         HAMLET.   They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I will speak to  this fellow.—Whose grave’s this, sir?        FIRST CLOWN.   Mine, sir.   [ Sings. ]      O, a pit of clay for to be made        For such a guest is meet.         HAMLET.   I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in’t.         FIRST CLOWN.   You lie out on’t, sir, and therefore ’tis not yours.   For my part, I do not lie in’t, yet it is mine.         HAMLET.   Thou dost lie in’t, to be in’t and say it is thine. ’Tis for the dead, not for  the quick; therefore thou liest.        FIRST CLOWN.   ’Tis a quick lie, sir; ’t will away again from me to you.        HAMLET.   What man dost thou dig it for?         FIRST CLOWN.   For no man, sir.        HAMLET.   What woman then?         FIRST CLOWN.   For none neither.        HAMLET.   Who is to be buried in’t?         FIRST CLOWN.   One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she’s dead.        HAMLET.   How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or equivocation will undo  us. By the Lord, Horatio, these three years I have taken note of it, the age is  grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the  courtier he galls his kibe.—How long hast thou been a grave-maker?        FIRST CLOWN.   Of all the days i’ th’ year, I came to’t that day that our last King Hamlet  o’ercame Fortinbras.        HAMLET.   How long is that since?         FIRST CLOWN.   Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was the very day that young  Hamlet was born,—he that is mad, and sent into England.        HAMLET.   Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?         FIRST CLOWN.   Why, because he was mad; he shall recover his wits there; or if he do not, it’s  no great matter there.        HAMLET.   Why?         FIRST CLOWN.   ’Twill not be seen in him there; there the men are as mad as he.        HAMLET.   How came he mad?         FIRST CLOWN.   Very strangely, they say.        HAMLET.   How strangely?         FIRST CLOWN.   Faith, e’en with losing his wits.        HAMLET.   Upon what ground?         FIRST CLOWN.   Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty years.        HAMLET.   How long will a man lie i’ th’earth ere he rot?         FIRST CLOWN.   Faith, if he be not rotten before he die,—as we have many pocky corses nowadays  that will scarce hold the laying in,—he will last you some eight year or nine  year. A tanner will last you nine year.        HAMLET.   Why he more than another?         FIRST CLOWN.   Why, sir, his hide is so tann’d with his trade that he will keep out water a  great while. And your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.  Here’s a skull now; this skull hath lain in the earth three-and-twenty years.        HAMLET.   Whose was it?         FIRST CLOWN.   A whoreson, mad fellow’s it was. Whose do you think it was?        HAMLET.   Nay, I know not.         FIRST CLOWN.   A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! A pour’d a flagon of Rhenish on my head  once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick’s skull, the King’s jester.        HAMLET.   This?         FIRST CLOWN.   E’en that.        HAMLET.   Let me see. [ Takes the skull. ] Alas, poor Yorick. I knew him, Horatio, a  fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He hath borne me on his back  a thousand times; and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is! My gorge rises  at it. Here hung those lips that I have kiss’d I know not how oft. Where be  your gibes now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that were  wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning? Quite  chop-fallen? Now get you to my lady’s chamber, and tell her, let her paint an  inch thick, to this favour she must come. Make her laugh at that.—Prithee,  Horatio, tell me one thing.        HORATIO.   What’s that, my lord?         HAMLET.   Dost thou think Alexander looked o’ this fashion i’ th’earth?         HORATIO.   E’en so.         HAMLET.   And smelt so? Pah!         [ Throws down the skull. ]        HORATIO.   E’en so, my lord.         HAMLET.   To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not imagination trace the  noble dust of Alexander till he find it stopping a bung-hole?        HORATIO.   ’Twere to consider too curiously to consider so.         HAMLET.   No, faith, not a jot. But to follow him thither with modesty enough, and  likelihood to lead it; as thus. Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander  returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that  loam whereto he was converted might they not stop a beer-barrel?   Imperious Caesar, dead and turn’d to clay,   Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.   O, that that earth which kept the world in awe   Should patch a wall t’expel the winter’s flaw.   But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King.         Enter  priests, &amp;c,  in procession; the corpse  of  Ophelia, Laertes  and  Mourners  following;  King,  Queen,  their Trains, &amp;c.        The Queen, the courtiers. Who is that they follow?   And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken   The corse they follow did with desperate hand   Fordo it own life. ’Twas of some estate.   Couch we awhile and mark.         [ Retiring with  Horatio . ]        LAERTES.   What ceremony else?         HAMLET.   That is Laertes, a very noble youth. Mark.        LAERTES.   What ceremony else?         PRIEST.   Her obsequies have been as far enlarg’d   As we have warranties. Her death was doubtful;   And but that great command o’ersways the order,   She should in ground unsanctified have lodg’d   Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,   Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.   Yet here she is allowed her virgin rites,   Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home   Of bell and burial.         LAERTES.   Must there no more be done?         PRIEST.   No more be done.   We should profane the service of the dead   To sing sage requiem and such rest to her   As to peace-parted souls.         LAERTES.   Lay her i’ th’earth,   And from her fair and unpolluted flesh   May violets spring. I tell thee, churlish priest,   A minist’ring angel shall my sister be   When thou liest howling.         HAMLET.   What, the fair Ophelia?         QUEEN.   [ Scattering flowers. ] Sweets to the sweet. Farewell.   I hop’d thou shouldst have been my Hamlet’s wife;   I thought thy bride-bed to have deck’d, sweet maid,   And not have strew’d thy grave.         LAERTES.   O, treble woe   Fall ten times treble on that cursed head   Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense   Depriv’d thee of. Hold off the earth a while,   Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.   [ Leaps into the grave. ]   Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,   Till of this flat a mountain you have made,   To o’ertop old Pelion or the skyish head   Of blue Olympus.         HAMLET.   [ Advancing. ]   What is he whose grief   Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow   Conjures the wand’ring stars, and makes them stand   Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,   Hamlet the Dane.   [ Leaps into the grave. ]         LAERTES.   [ Grappling with him. ] The devil take thy soul!        HAMLET.   Thou pray’st not well.   I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;   For though I am not splenative and rash,   Yet have I in me something dangerous,   Which let thy wiseness fear. Away thy hand!         KING.   Pluck them asunder.         QUEEN.   Hamlet! Hamlet!         All.   Gentlemen!         HORATIO.   Good my lord, be quiet.         [ The  Attendants  part them, and they come out  of the grave. ]        HAMLET.   Why, I will fight with him upon this theme   Until my eyelids will no longer wag.         QUEEN.   O my son, what theme?         HAMLET.   I lov’d Ophelia; forty thousand brothers   Could not, with all their quantity of love,   Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?         KING.   O, he is mad, Laertes.         QUEEN.   For love of God forbear him!         HAMLET.   ’Swounds, show me what thou’lt do:   Woul’t weep? woul’t fight? woul’t fast? woul’t tear thyself?   Woul’t drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?   I’ll do’t. Dost thou come here to whine?   To outface me with leaping in her grave?   Be buried quick with her, and so will I.   And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw   Millions of acres on us, till our ground,   Singeing his pate against the burning zone,   Make Ossa like a wart. Nay, an thou’lt mouth,   I’ll rant as well as thou.         QUEEN.   This is mere madness:   And thus awhile the fit will work on him;   Anon, as patient as the female dove,   When that her golden couplets are disclos’d,   His silence will sit drooping.         HAMLET.   Hear you, sir;   What is the reason that you use me thus?   I lov’d you ever. But it is no matter.   Let Hercules himself do what he may,   The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.         [ Exit. ]        KING.   I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.         [ Exit  Horatio . ]        [ To Laertes ]   Strengthen your patience in our last night’s speech;   We’ll put the matter to the present push.—   Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.   This grave shall have a living monument.   An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;   Till then in patience our proceeding be.         [ Exeunt. ]          SCENE II. A hall in the  Castle.       Enter  Hamlet  and  Horatio .        HAMLET.   So much for this, sir. Now let me see the other;   You do remember all the circumstance?         HORATIO.   Remember it, my lord!         HAMLET.   Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting   That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay   Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly,   And prais’d be rashness for it,—let us know,   Our indiscretion sometime serves us well,   When our deep plots do pall; and that should teach us   There’s a divinity that shapes our ends,   Rough-hew them how we will.         HORATIO.   That is most certain.         HAMLET.   Up from my cabin,   My sea-gown scarf’d about me, in the dark   Grop’d I to find out them; had my desire,   Finger’d their packet, and in fine, withdrew   To mine own room again, making so bold,   My fears forgetting manners, to unseal   Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,   Oh royal knavery! an exact command,   Larded with many several sorts of reasons,   Importing Denmark’s health, and England’s too,   With ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,   That on the supervise, no leisure bated,   No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,   My head should be struck off.         HORATIO.   Is’t possible?         HAMLET.   Here’s the commission, read it at more leisure.   But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?         HORATIO.   I beseech you.         HAMLET.   Being thus benetted round with villanies,—   Or I could make a prologue to my brains,   They had begun the play,—I sat me down,   Devis’d a new commission, wrote it fair:   I once did hold it, as our statists do,   A baseness to write fair, and labour’d much   How to forget that learning; but, sir, now   It did me yeoman’s service. Wilt thou know   The effect of what I wrote?         HORATIO.   Ay, good my lord.         HAMLET.   An earnest conjuration from the King,   As England was his faithful tributary,   As love between them like the palm might flourish,   As peace should still her wheaten garland wear   And stand a comma ’tween their amities,   And many such-like ‘as’es of great charge,   That on the view and know of these contents,   Without debatement further, more or less,   He should the bearers put to sudden death,   Not shriving-time allow’d.         HORATIO.   How was this seal’d?         HAMLET.   Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.   I had my father’s signet in my purse,   Which was the model of that Danish seal:   Folded the writ up in the form of the other,   Subscrib’d it: gave’t th’impression; plac’d it safely,   The changeling never known. Now, the next day   Was our sea-fight, and what to this was sequent   Thou know’st already.         HORATIO.   So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to’t.         HAMLET.   Why, man, they did make love to this employment.   They are not near my conscience; their defeat   Does by their own insinuation grow.   ’Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes   Between the pass and fell incensed points   Of mighty opposites.         HORATIO.   Why, what a king is this!         HAMLET.   Does it not, thinks’t thee, stand me now upon,—   He that hath kill’d my king, and whor’d my mother,   Popp’d in between th’election and my hopes,   Thrown out his angle for my proper life,   And with such cozenage—is’t not perfect conscience   To quit him with this arm? And is’t not to be damn’d   To let this canker of our nature come   In further evil?         HORATIO.   It must be shortly known to him from England   What is the issue of the business there.         HAMLET.   It will be short. The interim is mine;   And a man’s life’s no more than to say ‘One’.   But I am very sorry, good Horatio,   That to Laertes I forgot myself;   For by the image of my cause I see   The portraiture of his. I’ll court his favours.   But sure the bravery of his grief did put me   Into a tow’ring passion.         HORATIO.   Peace, who comes here?         Enter  Osric .        OSRIC.   Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.         HAMLET.   I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this waterfly?         HORATIO.   No, my good lord.         HAMLET.   Thy state is the more gracious; for ’tis a vice to know him. He hath much land,  and fertile; let a beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the  king’s mess; ’tis a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.        OSRIC.   Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart a thing to you  from his Majesty.        HAMLET.   I will receive it with all diligence of spirit. Put your bonnet to his right  use; ’tis for the head.        OSRIC.   I thank your lordship, ’tis very hot.         HAMLET.   No, believe me, ’tis very cold, the wind is northerly.         OSRIC.   It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.         HAMLET.   Methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.         OSRIC.   Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,—as ’twere—I cannot tell how. But, my  lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your  head. Sir, this is the matter,—        HAMLET.   I beseech you, remember,—        [  Hamlet  moves him to put on his hat. ]        OSRIC.   Nay, in good faith; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is newly come to  court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent  differences, of very soft society and great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly  of him, he is the card or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the  continent of what part a gentleman would see.        HAMLET.   Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you, though I know, to divide him  inventorially would dizzy th’arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw neither, in  respect of his quick sail. But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a  soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make  true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him  his umbrage, nothing more.        OSRIC.   Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.         HAMLET.   The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath?        OSRIC.   Sir?         HORATIO.   Is’t not possible to understand in another tongue? You will do’t, sir, really.        HAMLET.   What imports the nomination of this gentleman?         OSRIC.   Of Laertes?         HORATIO.   His purse is empty already, all’s golden words are spent.         HAMLET.   Of him, sir.         OSRIC.   I know you are not ignorant,—         HAMLET.   I would you did, sir; yet in faith if you did, it would not much approve me.  Well, sir?        OSRIC.   You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is,—         HAMLET.   I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in excellence; but to  know a man well were to know himself.        OSRIC.   I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him, by them in his  meed he’s unfellowed.        HAMLET.   What’s his weapon?         OSRIC.   Rapier and dagger.         HAMLET.   That’s two of his weapons. But well.         OSRIC.   The King, sir, hath wager’d with him six Barbary horses, against the which he  has imponed, as I take it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their assigns,  as girdle, hangers, and so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to  fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very  liberal conceit.        HAMLET.   What call you the carriages?         HORATIO.   I knew you must be edified by the margin ere you had done.         OSRIC.   The carriages, sir, are the hangers.         HAMLET.   The phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry cannon by our  sides. I would it might be hangers till then. But on. Six Barbary horses  against six French swords, their assigns, and three liberal conceited  carriages: that’s the French bet against the Danish. Why is this all imponed,  as you call it?        OSRIC.   The King, sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes between you and him, he shall  not exceed you three hits. He hath laid on twelve for nine. And it would come  to immediate trial if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.        HAMLET.   How if I answer no?         OSRIC.   I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.         HAMLET.   Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty, it is the  breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be brought, the gentleman willing,  and the King hold his purpose, I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain  nothing but my shame and the odd hits.        OSRIC.   Shall I re-deliver you e’en so?         HAMLET.   To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.         OSRIC.   I commend my duty to your lordship.         HAMLET.   Yours, yours.         [ Exit  Osric . ]        He does well to commend it himself, there are no tongues else for’s turn.        HORATIO.   This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.         HAMLET.   He did comply with his dug before he suck’d it. Thus has he,—and many more of  the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on,— only got the tune of the  time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of yeasty collection, which carries  them through and through the most fanned and winnowed opinions; and do but blow  them to their trial, the bubbles are out.        Enter a  Lord .        LORD.   My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who brings back to  him that you attend him in the hall. He sends to know if your pleasure hold to  play with Laertes or that you will take longer time.        HAMLET.   I am constant to my purposes, they follow the King’s pleasure. If his fitness  speaks, mine is ready. Now or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.        LORD.   The King and Queen and all are coming down.         HAMLET.   In happy time.         LORD.   The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you  fall to play.        HAMLET.   She well instructs me.         [ Exit  Lord . ]        HORATIO.   You will lose this wager, my lord.         HAMLET.   I do not think so. Since he went into France, I have been in continual  practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all’s  here about my heart: but it is no matter.        HORATIO.   Nay, good my lord.         HAMLET.   It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving as would perhaps  trouble a woman.        HORATIO.   If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall their repair hither,  and say you are not fit.        HAMLET.   Not a whit, we defy augury. There’s a special providence in the fall of a  sparrow. If it be now, ’tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now;  if it be not now, yet it will come. The readiness is all. Since no man has  aught of what he leaves, what is’t to leave betimes?        Enter  King, Queen, Laertes, Lords, Osric  and   Attendants  with foils &amp;c.        KING.   Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.         [ The  King  puts  Laertes’s  hand into  Hamlet’s . ]        HAMLET.   Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;   But pardon’t as you are a gentleman.   This presence knows, and you must needs have heard,   How I am punish’d with sore distraction.   What I have done   That might your nature, honour, and exception   Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.   Was’t Hamlet wrong’d Laertes? Never Hamlet.   If Hamlet from himself be ta’en away,   And when he’s not himself does wrong Laertes,   Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.   Who does it, then? His madness. If’t be so,   Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong’d;   His madness is poor Hamlet’s enemy.   Sir, in this audience,   Let my disclaiming from a purpos’d evil   Free me so far in your most generous thoughts   That I have shot my arrow o’er the house   And hurt my brother.         LAERTES.   I am satisfied in nature,   Whose motive in this case should stir me most   To my revenge. But in my terms of honour   I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement   Till by some elder masters of known honour   I have a voice and precedent of peace   To keep my name ungor’d. But till that time   I do receive your offer’d love like love,   And will not wrong it.         HAMLET.   I embrace it freely,   And will this brother’s wager frankly play.—   Give us the foils; come on.         LAERTES.   Come, one for me.         HAMLET.   I’ll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance   Your skill shall like a star i’ th’ darkest night,   Stick fiery off indeed.         LAERTES.   You mock me, sir.         HAMLET.   No, by this hand.         KING.   Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,   You know the wager?         HAMLET.   Very well, my lord.   Your Grace has laid the odds o’ the weaker side.         KING.   I do not fear it. I have seen you both;   But since he is better’d, we have therefore odds.         LAERTES.   This is too heavy. Let me see another.         HAMLET.   This likes me well. These foils have all a length?         [ They prepare to play. ]        OSRIC.   Ay, my good lord.         KING.   Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.   If Hamlet give the first or second hit,   Or quit in answer of the third exchange,   Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;   The King shall drink to Hamlet’s better breath,   And in the cup an union shall he throw   Richer than that which four successive kings   In Denmark’s crown have worn. Give me the cups;   And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,   The trumpet to the cannoneer without,   The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,   ‘Now the King drinks to Hamlet.’ Come, begin.   And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.         HAMLET.   Come on, sir.         LAERTES.   Come, my lord.         [ They play. ]        HAMLET.   One.         LAERTES.   No.         HAMLET.   Judgement.         OSRIC.   A hit, a very palpable hit.         LAERTES.   Well; again.         KING.   Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;   Here’s to thy health.         [ Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within. ]        Give him the cup.        HAMLET.   I’ll play this bout first; set it by awhile.        [ They play. ]        Come. Another hit; what say you?         LAERTES.   A touch, a touch, I do confess.         KING.   Our son shall win.         QUEEN.   He’s fat, and scant of breath.   Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.   The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.         HAMLET.   Good madam.         KING.   Gertrude, do not drink.         QUEEN.   I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.         KING.   [ Aside. ] It is the poison’d cup; it is too late.         HAMLET.   I dare not drink yet, madam. By and by.         QUEEN.   Come, let me wipe thy face.         LAERTES.   My lord, I’ll hit him now.         KING.   I do not think’t.         LAERTES.   [ Aside. ] And yet ’tis almost ’gainst my conscience.         HAMLET.   Come for the third, Laertes. You do but dally.   I pray you pass with your best violence.   I am afeard you make a wanton of me.         LAERTES.   Say you so? Come on.         [ They play. ]        OSRIC.   Nothing neither way.         LAERTES.   Have at you now.         [  Laertes  wounds  Hamlet;  then, in scuffling, they change rapiers, and   Hamlet  wounds  Laertes . ]        KING.   Part them; they are incens’d.         HAMLET.   Nay, come again!         [ The  Queen  falls. ]        OSRIC.   Look to the Queen there, ho!         HORATIO.   They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?         OSRIC.   How is’t, Laertes?         LAERTES.   Why, as a woodcock to my own springe, Osric.   I am justly kill’d with mine own treachery.         HAMLET.   How does the Queen?         KING.   She swoons to see them bleed.         QUEEN.   No, no, the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!   The drink, the drink! I am poison’d.         [ Dies. ]        HAMLET.   O villany! Ho! Let the door be lock’d:   Treachery! Seek it out.         [  Laertes  falls. ]        LAERTES.   It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain.   No medicine in the world can do thee good.   In thee there is not half an hour of life;   The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,   Unbated and envenom’d. The foul practice   Hath turn’d itself on me. Lo, here I lie,   Never to rise again. Thy mother’s poison’d.   I can no more. The King, the King’s to blame.         HAMLET.   The point envenom’d too!   Then, venom, to thy work.         [ Stabs the  King . ]        OSRIC and LORDS.   Treason! treason!         KING.   O yet defend me, friends. I am but hurt.         HAMLET.   Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,   Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?   Follow my mother.         [  King  dies. ]        LAERTES.   He is justly serv’d.   It is a poison temper’d by himself.   Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.   Mine and my father’s death come not upon thee,   Nor thine on me.         [ Dies. ]        HAMLET.   Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.   I am dead, Horatio. Wretched Queen, adieu.   You that look pale and tremble at this chance,   That are but mutes or audience to this act,   Had I but time,—as this fell sergeant, death,   Is strict in his arrest,—O, I could tell you,—   But let it be. Horatio, I am dead,   Thou liv’st; report me and my cause aright   To the unsatisfied.         HORATIO.   Never believe it.   I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.   Here’s yet some liquor left.         HAMLET.   As th’art a man,   Give me the cup. Let go; by Heaven, I’ll have’t.   O good Horatio, what a wounded name,   Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me.   If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,   Absent thee from felicity awhile,   And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,   To tell my story.         [ March afar off, and shot within. ]        What warlike noise is this?        OSRIC.   Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,   To the ambassadors of England gives   This warlike volley.         HAMLET.   O, I die, Horatio.   The potent poison quite o’er-crows my spirit:   I cannot live to hear the news from England,   But I do prophesy th’election lights   On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.   So tell him, with the occurrents more and less,   Which have solicited. The rest is silence.         [ Dies. ]        HORATIO.   Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,   And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.   Why does the drum come hither?         [ March within. ]        Enter  Fortinbras, the English Ambassadors  and  others.        FORTINBRAS.   Where is this sight?         HORATIO.   What is it you would see?   If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.         FORTINBRAS.   This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,   What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,   That thou so many princes at a shot   So bloodily hast struck?         FIRST AMBASSADOR.   The sight is dismal;   And our affairs from England come too late.   The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,   To tell him his commandment is fulfill’d,   That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.   Where should we have our thanks?         HORATIO.   Not from his mouth,   Had it th’ability of life to thank you.   He never gave commandment for their death.   But since, so jump upon this bloody question,   You from the Polack wars, and you from England   Are here arriv’d, give order that these bodies   High on a stage be placed to the view,   And let me speak to th’ yet unknowing world   How these things came about. So shall you hear   Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts,   Of accidental judgements, casual slaughters,   Of deaths put on by cunning and forc’d cause,   And, in this upshot, purposes mistook   Fall’n on the inventors’ heads. All this can I   Truly deliver.         FORTINBRAS.   Let us haste to hear it,   And call the noblest to the audience.   For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.   I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,   Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.         HORATIO.   Of that I shall have also cause to speak,   And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.   But let this same be presently perform’d,   Even while men’s minds are wild, lest more mischance   On plots and errors happen.         FORTINBRAS.   Let four captains   Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage,   For he was likely, had he been put on,   To have prov’d most royally; and for his passage,   The soldiers’ music and the rites of war   Speak loudly for him.   Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this   Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.   Go, bid the soldiers shoot.         [ A dead march. ]        [ Exeunt, bearing off the bodies, after which a peal of ordnance is shot  off. ]             <a '"

As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a  thousand crowns, and, as thou sayst, charged my brother, on his blessing, to  breed me well; and there begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at  school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me  rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at home unkept;  for call you that keeping, for a gentleman of my birth, that differs not from  the stalling of an ox? His horses are bred better, for, besides that they are  fair with their feeding, they are taught their manage and to that end riders  dearly hired; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth, for the  which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I. Besides this  nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave me his  countenance seems to take from me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the  place of a brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my  education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me, and the spirit of my father,  which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against this servitude.

Besides this  nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave me his  countenance seems to take from me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the  place of a brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my  education.
