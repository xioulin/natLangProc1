But they think we are too\\r\\ndear. The leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an\\r\\ninventory to particularize their abundance; our sufferance is a gain to\\r\\nthem.

The painful service,<br>\\r\\nThe extreme dangers, and the drops of blood<br>\\r\\nShed for my thankless country are requited<br>\\r\\nBut with that surname, a good memory<br>\\r\\nAnd witness of the malice and displeasure<br>\\r\\nWhich thou shouldst bear me.

Let me twine<br>\\r\\nMine arms about that body, whereagainst<br>\\r\\nMy grained ash an hundred times hath broke<br>\\r\\nAnd scarred the moon with splinters.

       "'ACT I       SCENE I. Rome. A street       Enter a company of mutinous Citizens, with staves, clubs, and other weapons.        FIRST CITIZEN.   Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.        ALL.   Speak, speak!        FIRST CITIZEN.   You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?        ALL.   Resolved, resolved!        FIRST CITIZEN.   First, you know Caius Martius is chief enemy to the people.        ALL.   We know’t, we know’t!        FIRST CITIZEN.   Let us kill him, and we’ll have corn at our own price. Is’t a verdict?        ALL.   No more talking on’t; let it be done. Away, away!        SECOND CITIZEN.   One word, good citizens.        FIRST CITIZEN.   We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good. What authority surfeits on  would relieve us. If they would yield us but the superfluity while it were  wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely. But they think we are too  dear. The leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an  inventory to particularize their abundance; our sufferance is a gain to  them. Let us revenge this with our pikes ere we become rakes; for the gods know  I speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.        SECOND CITIZEN.   Would you proceed especially against Caius Martius?        FIRST CITIZEN.   Against him first. He’s a very dog to the commonalty.        SECOND CITIZEN.   Consider you what services he has done for his country?        FIRST CITIZEN.   Very well, and could be content to give him good report for’t, but that he pays  himself with being proud.        SECOND CITIZEN.   Nay, but speak not maliciously.        FIRST CITIZEN.   I say unto you, what he hath done famously he did it to that end. Though  soft-conscienced men can be content to say it was for his country, he did it to  please his mother and to be partly proud, which he is, even to the altitude of  his virtue.        SECOND CITIZEN.   What he cannot help in his nature you account a vice in him. You must in no way  say he is covetous.        FIRST CITIZEN.   If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations. He hath faults, with  surplus, to tire in repetition. [ Shouts within .] What shouts are these?  The other side o’ th’ city is risen. Why stay we prating here? To th’ Capitol!        ALL.   Come, come!        Enter  Menenius Agrippa .        FIRST CITIZEN.   Soft, who comes here?        SECOND CITIZEN.   Worthy Menenius Agrippa, one that hath always loved the people.        FIRST CITIZEN.   He’s one honest enough. Would all the rest were so!        MENENIUS.   What work’s, my countrymen, in hand? Where go you   With bats and clubs? The matter? Speak, I pray you.        FIRST CITIZEN.   Our business is not unknown to th’ Senate. They have had inkling this fortnight  what we intend to do, which now we’ll show ’em in deeds. They say poor suitors  have strong breaths; they shall know we have strong arms too.        MENENIUS.   Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,   Will you undo yourselves?        FIRST CITIZEN.   We cannot, sir; we are undone already.        MENENIUS.   I tell you, friends, most charitable care   Have the patricians of you. For your wants,   Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well   Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them   Against the Roman state, whose course will on   The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs   Of more strong link asunder than can ever   Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,   The gods, not the patricians, make it, and   Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,   You are transported by calamity   Thither where more attends you, and you slander   The helms o’ th’ state, who care for you like fathers,   When you curse them as enemies.        FIRST CITIZEN.   Care for us? True, indeed! They ne’er cared for us yet. Suffer us to famish,  and their storehouses crammed with grain; make edicts for usury to support  usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act established against the rich, and  provide more piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain the poor. If the  wars eat us not up, they will; and there’s all the love they bear us.        MENENIUS.   Either you must confess yourselves wondrous malicious   Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you   A pretty tale. It may be you have heard it,   But since it serves my purpose, I will venture   To stale’t a little more.        FIRST CITIZEN.   Well, I’ll hear it, sir; yet you must not think to fob off our disgrace with a  tale. But, an’t please you, deliver.        MENENIUS.   There was a time when all the body’s members   Rebelled against the belly, thus accused it:   That only like a gulf it did remain   I’ th’ midst o’ th’ body, idle and unactive,   Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing   Like labour with the rest, where th’ other instruments   Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,   And, mutually participate, did minister   Unto the appetite and affection common   Of the whole body. The belly answered—        FIRST CITIZEN.   Well, sir, what answer made the belly?        MENENIUS.   Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,   Which ne’er came from the lungs, but even thus—   For, look you, I may make the belly smile   As well as speak—it tauntingly replied   To th’ discontented members, the mutinous parts   That envied his receipt; even so most fitly   As you malign our senators for that   They are not such as you.        FIRST CITIZEN.   Your belly’s answer—what?   The kingly crowned head, the vigilant eye,   The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,   Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter,   With other muniments and petty helps   Is this our fabric, if that they—        MENENIUS.   What then?   ’Fore me, this fellow speaks. What then? What then?        FIRST CITIZEN.   Should by the cormorant belly be restrained,   Who is the sink o’ th’ body—        MENENIUS.   Well, what then?        FIRST CITIZEN.   The former agents, if they did complain,   What could the belly answer?        MENENIUS.   I will tell you,   If you’ll bestow a small—of what you have little—   Patience awhile, you’st hear the belly’s answer.        FIRST CITIZEN.   You are long about it.        MENENIUS.   Note me this, good friend;   Your most grave belly was deliberate,   Not rash like his accusers, and thus answered:   “True is it, my incorporate friends,” quoth he,   “That I receive the general food at first   Which you do live upon; and fit it is,   Because I am the storehouse and the shop   Of the whole body. But, if you do remember,   I send it through the rivers of your blood   Even to the court, the heart, to th’ seat o’ th’ brain;   And, through the cranks and offices of man,   The strongest nerves and small inferior veins   From me receive that natural competency   Whereby they live. And though that all at once,   You, my good friends”—this says the belly, mark me—        FIRST CITIZEN.   Ay, sir, well, well.        MENENIUS.   “Though all at once cannot   See what I do deliver out to each,   Yet I can make my audit up, that all   From me do back receive the flour of all,   And leave me but the bran.” What say you to’t?        FIRST CITIZEN.   It was an answer. How apply you this?        MENENIUS.   The senators of Rome are this good belly,   And you the mutinous members. For examine   Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly   Touching the weal o’ th’ common, you shall find   No public benefit which you receive   But it proceeds or comes from them to you   And no way from yourselves. What do you think,   You, the great toe of this assembly?        FIRST CITIZEN.   I the great toe? Why the great toe?        MENENIUS.   For that, being one o’ th’ lowest, basest, poorest,   Of this most wise rebellion, thou goest foremost.   Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,   Lead’st first to win some vantage.   But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs.   Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;   The one side must have bale.        Enter  Caius Martius .        Hail, noble Martius.        MARTIUS.   Thanks.—What’s the matter, you dissentious rogues,   That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,   Make yourselves scabs?        FIRST CITIZEN.   We have ever your good word.        MARTIUS.   He that will give good words to thee will flatter   Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,   That like nor peace nor war? The one affrights you;   The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,   Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;   Where foxes, geese. You are no surer, no,   Than is the coal of fire upon the ice   Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is   To make him worthy whose offence subdues him,   And curse that justice did it. Who deserves greatness   Deserves your hate; and your affections are   A sick man’s appetite, who desires most that   Which would increase his evil. He that depends   Upon your favours swims with fins of lead,   And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust ye?   With every minute you do change a mind   And call him noble that was now your hate,   Him vile that was your garland. What’s the matter,   That in these several places of the city   You cry against the noble senate, who,   Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else   Would feed on one another?—What’s their seeking?        MENENIUS.   For corn at their own rates, whereof they say   The city is well stored.        MARTIUS.   Hang ’em! They say?   They’ll sit by th’ fire and presume to know   What’s done i’ th’ Capitol, who’s like to rise,   Who thrives and who declines; side factions and give out   Conjectural marriages, making parties strong   And feebling such as stand not in their liking   Below their cobbled shoes. They say there’s grain enough?   Would the nobility lay aside their ruth   And let me use my sword, I’d make a quarry   With thousands of these quartered slaves as high   As I could pick my lance.        MENENIUS.   Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;   For though abundantly they lack discretion,   Yet are they passing cowardly. But I beseech you,   What says the other troop?        MARTIUS.   They are dissolved. Hang ’em!   They said they were an-hungry, sighed forth proverbs   That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,   That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not   Corn for the rich men only. With these shreds   They vented their complainings, which being answered   And a petition granted them—a strange one,   To break the heart of generosity   And make bold power look pale—they threw their caps   As they would hang them on the horns o’ th’ moon,   Shouting their emulation.        MENENIUS.   What is granted them?        MARTIUS.   Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,   Of their own choice. One’s Junius Brutus,   Sicinius Velutus, and I know not. ’Sdeath!   The rabble should have first unroofed the city   Ere so prevailed with me. It will in time   Win upon power and throw forth greater themes   For insurrection’s arguing.        MENENIUS.   This is strange.        MARTIUS.   Go get you home, you fragments.        Enter a  Messenger  hastily.        MESSENGER.   Where’s Caius Martius?        MARTIUS.   Here. What’s the matter?        MESSENGER.   The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.        MARTIUS.   I am glad on’t. Then we shall ha’ means to vent   Our musty superfluity.        Enter  Sicinius Velutus, Junius Brutus , two  Tribunes;  Cominius, Titus Lartius  with other  Senators.        See, our best elders.        FIRST SENATOR.   Martius, ’tis true that you have lately told us:   The Volsces are in arms.        MARTIUS.   They have a leader,   Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to’t.   I sin in envying his nobility,   And, were I anything but what I am,   I would wish me only he.        COMINIUS.   You have fought together.        MARTIUS.   Were half to half the world by th’ ears and he   Upon my party, I’d revolt, to make   Only my wars with him. He is a lion   That I am proud to hunt.        FIRST SENATOR.   Then, worthy Martius,   Attend upon Cominius to these wars.        COMINIUS.   It is your former promise.        MARTIUS.   Sir, it is,   And I am constant.—Titus Lartius, thou   Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus’ face.   What, art thou stiff? Stand’st out?        TITUS LARTIUS.   No, Caius Martius,   I’ll lean upon one crutch and fight with th’ other   Ere stay behind this business.        MENENIUS.   O, true bred!        FIRST SENATOR.   Your company to th’ Capitol, where I know   Our greatest friends attend us.        TITUS LARTIUS.   Lead you on.   Follow Cominius. We must follow you;   Right worthy your priority.        COMINIUS.   Noble Martius.        FIRST SENATOR.   [ To the Citizens .]   Hence to your homes, begone.        MARTIUS.   Nay, let them follow.   The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither   To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutineers,   Your valour puts well forth. Pray follow.        [ Exeunt.  Sicinius  and   Brutus  remain .]        SICINIUS.   Was ever man so proud as is this Martius?        BRUTUS.   He has no equal.        SICINIUS.   When we were chosen tribunes for the people—        BRUTUS.   Marked you his lip and eyes?        SICINIUS.   Nay, but his taunts.        BRUTUS.   Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.        SICINIUS.   Bemock the modest moon.        BRUTUS.   The present wars devour him! He is grown   Too proud to be so valiant.        SICINIUS.   Such a nature,   Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow   Which he treads on at noon. But I do wonder   His insolence can brook to be commanded   Under Cominius.        BRUTUS.   Fame, at the which he aims,   In whom already he’s well graced, cannot   Better be held nor more attained than by   A place below the first; for what miscarries   Shall be the General’s fault, though he perform   To th’ utmost of a man, and giddy censure   Will then cry out of Martius “O, if he   Had borne the business!”        SICINIUS.   Besides, if things go well,   Opinion that so sticks on Martius shall   Of his demerits rob Cominius.        BRUTUS.   Come.   Half all Cominius’ honours are to Martius,   Though Martius earned them not, and all his faults   To Martius shall be honours, though indeed   In aught he merit not.        SICINIUS.   Let’s hence and hear   How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,   More than in singularity, he goes   Upon this present action.        BRUTUS.   Let’s along.      [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE II. Corioles. The Senate House       Enter  Tullus Aufidius  with Senators of Corioles.        FIRST SENATOR.   So, your opinion is, Aufidius,   That they of Rome are entered in our counsels   And know how we proceed.        AUFIDIUS.   Is it not yours?   What ever have been thought on in this state   That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome   Had circumvention? ’Tis not four days gone   Since I heard thence. These are the words—I think   I have the letter here. Yes, here it is.   [ Reads .]  They have pressed a power, but it is not known   Whether for east or west. The dearth is great.   The people mutinous; and, it is rumoured,   Cominius, Martius your old enemy,   Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,—   And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,   These three lead on this preparation   Whither ’tis bent. Most likely ’tis for you.   Consider of it.         FIRST SENATOR.   Our army’s in the field.   We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready   To answer us.        AUFIDIUS.   Nor did you think it folly   To keep your great pretences veiled till when   They needs must show themselves, which, in the hatching,   It seemed, appeared to Rome. By the discovery   We shall be shortened in our aim, which was   To take in many towns ere almost Rome   Should know we were afoot.        SECOND SENATOR.   Noble Aufidius,   Take your commission; hie you to your bands.   Let us alone to guard Corioles.   If they set down before’s, for the remove   Bring up your army. But I think you’ll find   They’ve not prepared for us.        AUFIDIUS.   O, doubt not that;   I speak from certainties. Nay, more,   Some parcels of their power are forth already,   And only hitherward. I leave your Honours.   If we and Caius Martius chance to meet,   ’Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike   Till one can do no more.        ALL.   The gods assist you!        AUFIDIUS.   And keep your Honours safe!        FIRST SENATOR.   Farewell.        SECOND SENATOR.   Farewell.        ALL.   Farewell.      [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE III. Rome. An apartment in Martius’ house       Enter  Volumnia  and  Virgilia , mother and wife to Martius. They set them  down on two low stools and sew.        VOLUMNIA.   I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more comfortable sort. If  my son were my husband, I should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he  won honour than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love.  When yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when youth with  comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when for a day of kings’ entreaties a  mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering how  honour would become such a person—that it was no better than picture-like to  hang by th’ wall, if renown made it not stir—was pleased to let him seek danger  where he was like to find fame. To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he  returned, his brows bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not more in  joy at first hearing he was a man-child than now in first seeing he had proved  himself a man.        VIRGILIA.   But had he died in the business, madam, how then?        VOLUMNIA.   Then his good report should have been my son; I therein would have found issue.  Hear me profess sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love alike and none  less dear than thine and my good Martius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for  their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.        Enter a  Gentlewoman .        GENTLEWOMAN.   Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.        VIRGILIA.   Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.        VOLUMNIA.   Indeed you shall not.   Methinks I hear hither your husband’s drum,   See him pluck Aufidius down by th’ hair;   As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him.   Methinks I see him stamp thus and call thus:   “Come on, you cowards! You were got in fear,   Though you were born in Rome.” His bloody brow   With his mailed hand then wiping, forth he goes   Like to a harvestman that’s tasked to mow   Or all or lose his hire.        VIRGILIA.   His bloody brow? O Jupiter, no blood!        VOLUMNIA.   Away, you fool! It more becomes a man   Than gilt his trophy. The breasts of Hecuba,   When she did suckle Hector, looked not lovelier   Than Hector’s forehead when it spit forth blood   At Grecian sword, contemning.—Tell Valeria   We are fit to bid her welcome.      [ Exit  Gentlewoman . ]      VIRGILIA.   Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!        VOLUMNIA.   He’ll beat Aufidius’ head below his knee   And tread upon his neck.        Enter  Valeria  with an Usher and a   Gentlewoman .        VALERIA.   My ladies both, good day to you.        VOLUMNIA.   Sweet madam.        VIRGILIA.   I am glad to see your Ladyship.        VALERIA.   How do you both? You are manifest housekeepers. What are you sewing here? A  fine spot, in good faith. How does your little son?        VIRGILIA.   I thank your Ladyship; well, good madam.        VOLUMNIA.   He had rather see the swords and hear a drum than look upon his schoolmaster.        VALERIA.   O’ my word, the father’s son! I’ll swear ’tis a very pretty boy. O’ my troth, I  looked upon him o’ Wednesday half an hour together. H’as such a confirmed  countenance. I saw him run after a gilded butterfly, and when he caught it, he  let it go again, and after it again, and over and over he comes, and up again,  catched it again. Or whether his fall enraged him or how ’twas, he did so set  his teeth and tear it. O, I warrant how he mammocked it!        VOLUMNIA.   One on’s father’s moods.        VALERIA.   Indeed, la, ’tis a noble child.        VIRGILIA.   A crack, madam.        VALERIA.   Come, lay aside your stitchery. I must have you play the idle huswife with me  this afternoon.        VIRGILIA.   No, good madam, I will not out of doors.        VALERIA.   Not out of doors?        VOLUMNIA.   She shall, she shall.        VIRGILIA.   Indeed, no, by your patience. I’ll not over the threshold till my lord return  from the wars.        VALERIA.   Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably. Come, you must go visit the good  lady that lies in.        VIRGILIA.   I will wish her speedy strength and visit her with my prayers, but I cannot go  thither.        VOLUMNIA.   Why, I pray you?        VIRGILIA.   ’Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.        VALERIA.   You would be another Penelope. Yet they say all the yarn she spun in Ulysses’  absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths. Come, I would your cambric were  sensible as your finger, that you might leave pricking it for pity. Come, you  shall go with us.        VIRGILIA.   No, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth.        VALERIA.   In truth, la, go with me, and I’ll tell you excellent news of your husband.        VIRGILIA.   O, good madam, there can be none yet.        VALERIA.   Verily, I do not jest with you. There came news from him last night.        VIRGILIA.   Indeed, madam!        VALERIA.   In earnest, it’s true. I heard a senator speak it. Thus it is: the Volsces have  an army forth, against whom Cominius the General is gone with one part of our  Roman power. Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before their city  Corioles. They nothing doubt prevailing, and to make it brief wars. This is  true, on mine honour, and so, I pray, go with us.        VIRGILIA.   Give me excuse, good madam. I will obey you in everything hereafter.        VOLUMNIA.   Let her alone, lady. As she is now, she will but disease our better mirth.        VALERIA.   In troth, I think she would.—Fare you well, then.—Come, good sweet  lady.—Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy solemness out o’ door, and go along with us.        VIRGILIA.   No, at a word, madam. Indeed I must not. I wish you much mirth.        VALERIA.   Well then, farewell.      [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE IV. Before Corioles       Enter  Martius, Titus Lartius , with drum and  colours, with Captains and Soldiers, as before the city of Corioles. To them a   Messenger .        MARTIUS.   Yonder comes news. A wager they have met.        LARTIUS.   My horse to yours, no.        MARTIUS.   ’Tis done.        LARTIUS.   Agreed.        MARTIUS.   [ To Messenger .] Say, has our general met the enemy?        MESSENGER.   They lie in view but have not spoke as yet.        LARTIUS.   So the good horse is mine.        MARTIUS.   I’ll buy him of you.        LARTIUS.   No, I’ll nor sell nor give him. Lend you him I will   For half a hundred years.—Summon the town.        MARTIUS.   How far off lie these armies?        MESSENGER.   Within this mile and half.        MARTIUS.   Then shall we hear their ’larum, and they ours.   Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,   That we with smoking swords may march from hence   To help our fielded friends!—Come, blow thy blast.        [ They sound a parley. ]        Enter two  Senators  with others on the walls of Corioles.        Tullus Aufidius, is he within your walls?        FIRST SENATOR.   No, nor a man that fears you less than he:   That’s lesser than a little.   [ Drum afar off .]   Hark, our drums   Are bringing forth our youth. We’ll break our walls   Rather than they shall pound us up. Our gates,   Which yet seem shut, we have but pinned with rushes.   They’ll open of themselves.   [ Alarum far off .]   Hark you, far off!   There is Aufidius. List what work he makes   Amongst your cloven army.        MARTIUS.   O, they are at it!        LARTIUS.   Their noise be our instruction.—Ladders, ho!        Enter the Army of the  Volsces  as through the city gates.        MARTIUS.   They fear us not but issue forth their city.—   Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight   With hearts more proof than shields.—Advance, brave Titus.   They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,   Which makes me sweat with wrath.—Come on, my fellows!   He that retires, I’ll take him for a Volsce,   And he shall feel mine edge.      [ Alarums. The Romans are beat back to their trenches. They  exit, with the  Volsces  following .]      Enter  Martius  cursing, with Roman soldiers.        MARTIUS.   All the contagion of the south light on you,   You shames of Rome! You herd of—Boils and plagues   Plaster you o’er, that you may be abhorred   Farther than seen, and one infect another   Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,   That bear the shapes of men, how have you run   From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!   All hurt behind. Backs red, and faces pale   With flight and agued fear! Mend, and charge home,   Or, by the fires of heaven, I’ll leave the foe   And make my wars on you. Look to’t. Come on!   If you’ll stand fast we’ll beat them to their wives,   As they us to our trenches. Follow’s!        [ Another alarum. The Volsces re-enter and are driven back to the gates of  Corioles, which open to admit them. ]        So, now the gates are ope. Now prove good seconds!   ’Tis for the followers fortune widens them,   Not for the fliers. Mark me, and do the like.      [  Martius  follows the fleeing  Volsces through the gates, and is shut in. ]      FIRST SOLDIER.   Foolhardiness, not I.        SECOND SOLDIER.   Nor I.        FIRST SOLDIER.   See, they have shut him in.      [ Alarum continues. ]      ALL.   To th’ pot, I warrant him.        Enter  Titus Lartius .        LARTIUS.   What is become of Martius?        ALL.   Slain, sir, doubtless.        FIRST SOLDIER.   Following the fliers at the very heels,   With them he enters, who upon the sudden   Clapped to their gates. He is himself alone,   To answer all the city.        LARTIUS.   O noble fellow,   Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,   And when it bows, stand’st up! Thou art left, Martius.   A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,   Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier   Even to Cato’s wish, not fierce and terrible   Only in strokes, but with thy grim looks and   The thunderlike percussion of thy sounds   Thou mad’st thine enemies shake, as if the world   Were feverous and did tremble.        Enter  Martius , bleeding, assaulted by the enemy.        FIRST SOLDIER.   Look, sir.        LARTIUS.   O, ’tis Martius!   Let’s fetch him off or make remain alike.      [ They fight, and all enter the city. ]        SCENE V. Within Corioles. A street       Enter certain  Romans , with spoils.        FIRST ROMAN.   This will I carry to Rome.        SECOND ROMAN.   And I this.        THIRD ROMAN.   A murrain on’t! I took this for silver.        Enter  Martius  and   Titus Lartius  with a Trumpet.        MARTIUS.   See here these movers that do prize their hours   At a cracked drachma. Cushions, leaden spoons,   Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would   Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,   Ere yet the fight be done, pack up. Down with them!      [ Exit the Romans with spoils. ]    [ Alarum continues still afar off. ]      And hark, what noise the General makes! To him!   There is the man of my soul’s hate, Aufidius,   Piercing our Romans. Then, valiant Titus, take   Convenient numbers to make good the city,   Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste   To help Cominius.        LARTIUS.   Worthy sir, thou bleed’st.   Thy exercise hath been too violent   For a second course of fight.        MARTIUS.   Sir, praise me not.   My work hath yet not warmed me. Fare you well.   The blood I drop is rather physical   Than dangerous to me. To Aufidius thus   I will appear and fight.        LARTIUS.   Now the fair goddess Fortune   Fall deep in love with thee, and her great charms   Misguide thy opposers’ swords! Bold gentleman,   Prosperity be thy page!        MARTIUS.   Thy friend no less   Than those she placeth highest! So farewell.        LARTIUS.   Thou worthiest Martius!      [ Exit  Martius . ]      Go sound thy trumpet in the marketplace.   Call thither all the officers o’ th’ town,   Where they shall know our mind. Away!      [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE VI. Near the camp of Cominius       Enter  Cominius  as it were in retire, with Soldiers.        COMINIUS.   Breathe you, my friends. Well fought! We are come off   Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands   Nor cowardly in retire. Believe me, sirs,   We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,   By interims and conveying gusts we have heard   The charges of our friends. The Roman gods   Lead their successes as we wish our own,   That both our powers, with smiling fronts encount’ring,   May give you thankful sacrifice!        Enter a  Messenger .        Thy news?        MESSENGER.   The citizens of Corioles have issued,   And given to Lartius and to Martius battle.   I saw our party to their trenches driven,   And then I came away.        COMINIUS.   Though thou speakest truth,   Methinks thou speak’st not well. How long is’t since?        MESSENGER.   Above an hour, my lord.        COMINIUS.   ’Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums.   How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour   And bring thy news so late?        MESSENGER.   Spies of the Volsces   Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel   Three or four miles about; else had I, sir,   Half an hour since brought my report.      [ Exit  Messenger . ]      Enter  Martius , bloody.        COMINIUS.   Who’s yonder,   That does appear as he were flayed? O gods,   He has the stamp of Martius, and I have   Before-time seen him thus.        MARTIUS.   Come I too late?        COMINIUS.   The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabor   More than I know the sound of Martius’ tongue   From every meaner man.        MARTIUS.   Come I too late?        COMINIUS.   Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,   But mantled in your own.        MARTIUS.   O, let me clip you   In arms as sound as when I wooed, in heart   As merry as when our nuptial day was done   And tapers burned to bedward!        COMINIUS.   Flower of warriors, how is’t with Titus Lartius?        MARTIUS.   As with a man busied about decrees,   Condemning some to death and some to exile;   Ransoming him or pitying, threat’ning the other;   Holding Corioles in the name of Rome   Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,   To let him slip at will.        COMINIUS.   Where is that slave   Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?   Where’s he? Call him hither.        MARTIUS.   Let him alone.   He did inform the truth. But for our gentlemen,   The common file—a plague! Tribunes for them!—   The mouse ne’er shunned the cat as they did budge   From rascals worse than they.        COMINIUS.   But how prevailed you?        MARTIUS.   Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.   Where is the enemy? Are you lords o’ th’ field?   If not, why cease you till you are so?        COMINIUS.   Martius, we have at disadvantage fought,   And did retire to win our purpose.        MARTIUS.   How lies their battle? Know you on which side   They have placed their men of trust?        COMINIUS.   As I guess, Martius,   Their bands i’ th’ vaward are the Antiates,   Of their best trust; o’er them Aufidius,   Their very heart of hope.        MARTIUS.   I do beseech you,   By all the battles wherein we have fought,   By th’ blood we have shed together, by th’ vows we have made   To endure friends, that you directly set me   Against Aufidius and his Antiates,   And that you not delay the present, but,   Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,   We prove this very hour.        COMINIUS.   Though I could wish   You were conducted to a gentle bath   And balms applied to you, yet dare I never   Deny your asking. Take your choice of those   That best can aid your action.        MARTIUS.   Those are they   That most are willing. If any such be here—   As it were sin to doubt—that love this painting   Wherein you see me smeared; if any fear   Lesser his person than an ill report;   If any think brave death outweighs bad life,   And that his country’s dearer than himself;   Let him alone, or so many so minded,   Wave thus to express his disposition   And follow Martius.        [ He waves his sword. ]        [ They all shout and wave their swords, take him up in their arms, and cast  up their caps. ]        O, me alone! Make you a sword of me?   If these shows be not outward, which of you   But is four Volsces? None of you but is   Able to bear against the great Aufidius   A shield as hard as his. A certain number,   Though thanks to all, must I select from all.   The rest shall bear the business in some other fight,   As cause will be obeyed. Please you to march,   And I shall quickly draw out my command,   Which men are best inclined.        COMINIUS.   March on, my fellows.   Make good this ostentation, and you shall   Divide in all with us.      [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE VII. The gates of Corioles        Titus Lartius , having set a guard upon Corioles,  going with drum and trumpet toward  Cominius  and   Caius Martius , enters with a  Lieutenant , other Soldiers, and a Scout.        LARTIUS.   So, let the ports be guarded. Keep your duties   As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch   Those centuries to our aid; the rest will serve   For a short holding. If we lose the field,   We cannot keep the town.        LIEUTENANT.   Fear not our care, sir.        LARTIUS.   Hence, and shut your gates upon’s.   Our guider, come. To th’ Roman camp conduct us.      [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE VIII. A field of battle between the Roman and the Volscian camps       Alarum, as in battle. Enter  Martius  and   Aufidius  at several doors.        MARTIUS.   I’ll fight with none but thee, for I do hate thee   Worse than a promise-breaker.        AUFIDIUS.   We hate alike.   Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor   More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.        MARTIUS.   Let the first budger die the other’s slave,   And the gods doom him after!        AUFIDIUS.   If I fly, Martius,   Hollo me like a hare.        MARTIUS.   Within these three hours, Tullus,   Alone I fought in your Corioles’ walls,   And made what work I pleased. ’Tis not my blood   Wherein thou seest me masked. For thy revenge   Wrench up thy power to th’ highest.        AUFIDIUS.   Wert thou the Hector   That was the whip of your bragged progeny,   Thou shouldst not scape me here.      [ Here they fight, and certain Volsces come to the aid of   Aufidius . ]      Officious and not valiant, you have shamed me   In your condemned seconds.        [  Martius  fights till they be driven in  breathless.  Aufidius  and  Martius  exit, separately. ]          SCENE IX. The Roman camp       Alarum. A retreat is sounded. Flourish. Enter, at one door,  Cominius  with the Romans; at another door,  Martius , with his arm in a scarf.        COMINIUS.   If I should tell thee o’er this thy day’s work,   Thou’t not believe thy deeds. But I’ll report it   Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles;   Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,   I’ th’ end admire; where ladies shall be frighted   And, gladly quaked, hear more; where the dull tribunes,   That with the fusty plebeians hate thine honours,   Shall say against their hearts “We thank the gods   Our Rome hath such a soldier.”   Yet cam’st thou to a morsel of this feast,   Having fully dined before.        Enter  Titus Lartius  with his power, from the pursuit.        LARTIUS.   O general,   Here is the steed, we the caparison.   Hadst thou beheld—        MARTIUS.   Pray now, no more. My mother,   Who has a charter to extol her blood,   When she does praise me grieves me. I have done   As you have done—that’s what I can;   Induced as you have been—that’s for my country.   He that has but effected his good will   Hath overta’en mine act.        COMINIUS.   You shall not be   The grave of your deserving. Rome must know   The value of her own. ’Twere a concealment   Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,   To hide your doings and to silence that   Which, to the spire and top of praises vouched,   Would seem but modest. Therefore, I beseech you—   In sign of what you are, not to reward   What you have done—before our army hear me.        MARTIUS.   I have some wounds upon me, and they smart   To hear themselves remembered.        COMINIUS.   Should they not,   Well might they fester ’gainst ingratitude   And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses—   Whereof we have ta’en good and good store—of all   The treasure in this field achieved and city,   We render you the tenth, to be ta’en forth   Before the common distribution   At your only choice.        MARTIUS.   I thank you, general,   But cannot make my heart consent to take   A bribe to pay my sword. I do refuse it;   And stand upon my common part with those   That have beheld the doing.        [ A long flourish. They all cry “Martius, Martius!” and cast up their caps and  lances.  Cominius  and  Lartius  stand bare. ]        May these same instruments which, you profane,   Never sound more! When drums and trumpets shall   I’ th’ field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be   Made all of false-faced soothing! When steel grows soft   Soft as the parasite’s silk, let him be made   An ovator for the wars! No more, I say.   For that I have not washed my nose that bled,   Or foiled some debile wretch—which, without note,   Here’s many else have done—you shout me forth   In acclamations hyperbolical,   As if I loved my little should be dieted   In praises sauced with lies.        COMINIUS.   Too modest are you,   More cruel to your good report than grateful   To us that give you truly. By your patience,   If ’gainst yourself you be incensed, we’ll put you,   Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,   Then reason safely with you. Therefore be it known,   As to us to all the world, that Caius Martius   Wears this war’s garland, in token of the which   My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,   With all his trim belonging. And from this time,   For what he did before Corioles, call him,   With all th’ applause and clamour of the host,   Caius Martius Coriolanus! Bear   Th’ addition nobly ever!      [ Flourish. Trumpets sound, and drums. ]      ALL.   Caius Martius Coriolanus!        CORIOLANUS.   I will go wash;   And when my face is fair, you shall perceive   Whether I blush or no. Howbeit, I thank you.   I mean to stride your steed and at all times   To undercrest your good addition   To th’ fairness of my power.        COMINIUS.   So, to our tent,   Where, ere we do repose us, we will write   To Rome of our success.—You, Titus Lartius,   Must to Corioles back. Send us to Rome   The best, with whom we may articulate   For their own good and ours.        LARTIUS.   I shall, my lord.        CORIOLANUS.   The gods begin to mock me. I, that now   Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg   Of my lord general.        COMINIUS.   Take’t, ’tis yours. What is’t?        CORIOLANUS.   I sometime lay here in Corioles   At a poor man’s house; he used me kindly.   He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;   But then Aufidius was within my view,   And wrath o’erwhelmed my pity. I request you   To give my poor host freedom.        COMINIUS.   O, well begged!   Were he the butcher of my son, he should   Be free as is the wind.—Deliver him, Titus.        LARTIUS.   Martius, his name?        CORIOLANUS.   By Jupiter, forgot!   I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.   Have we no wine here?        COMINIUS.   Go we to our tent.   The blood upon your visage dries; ’tis time   It should be looked to. Come.      [ A flourish of cornets. Exeunt. ]        SCENE X. The camp of the Volsces       A flourish. Cornets. Enter  Tullus Aufidius ,  bloody, with two or three soldiers.        AUFIDIUS.   The town is ta’en.        SOLDIER.   ’Twill be delivered back on good condition.        AUFIDIUS.   Condition?   I would I were a Roman, for I cannot,   Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition?   What good condition can a treaty find   I’ th’ part that is at mercy? Five times, Martius,   I have fought with thee; so often hast thou beat me   And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter   As often as we eat. By th’ elements,   If e’er again I meet him beard to beard,   He’s mine or I am his. Mine emulation   Hath not that honour in’t it had; for where   I thought to crush him in an equal force,   True sword to sword, I’ll potch at him some way,   Or wrath or craft may get him.        SOLDIER.   He’s the devil.        AUFIDIUS.   Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour’s poisoned   With only suff’ring stain by him; for him   Shall fly out of itself. Nor sleep nor sanctuary,   Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,   The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,   Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up   Their rotten privilege and custom ’gainst   My hate to Martius. Where I find him, were it   At home, upon my brother’s guard, even there,   Against the hospitable canon, would I   Wash my fierce hand in’s heart. Go you to th’ city;   Learn how ’tis held and what they are that must   Be hostages for Rome.        SOLDIER.   Will not you go?        AUFIDIUS.   I am attended at the cypress grove. I pray you—   ’Tis south the city mills,—bring me word thither   How the world goes, that to the pace of it   I may spur on my journey.        SOLDIER.   I shall, sir.      [ Exeunt. ]               ACT II       SCENE I. Rome. A public place       Enter  Menenius  with the two Tribunes of the people,   Sicinius  and  Brutus .        MENENIUS.   The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight.        BRUTUS.   Good or bad?        MENENIUS.   Not according to the prayer of the people, for they love not Martius.        SICINIUS.   Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.        MENENIUS.   Pray you, who does the wolf love?        SICINIUS.   The lamb.        MENENIUS.   Ay, to devour him, as the hungry plebeians would the noble Martius.        BRUTUS.   He’s a lamb indeed, that baas like a bear.        MENENIUS.   He’s a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two are old men; tell me one  thing that I shall ask you.        BOTH TRIBUNES.   Well, sir.        MENENIUS.   In what enormity is Martius poor in, that you two have not in abundance?        BRUTUS.   He’s poor in no one fault, but stored with all.        SICINIUS.   Especially in pride.        BRUTUS.   And topping all others in boasting.        MENENIUS.   This is strange now. Do you two know how you are censured here in the city, I  mean of us o’ th’ right-hand file, do you?        BOTH TRIBUNES.   Why, how are we censured?        MENENIUS.   Because you talk of pride now, will you not be angry?        BOTH TRIBUNES.   Well, well, sir, well?        MENENIUS.   Why, ’tis no great matter; for a very little thief of occasion will rob you of  a great deal of patience. Give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at  your pleasures, at the least, if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so.  You blame Martius for being proud.        BRUTUS.   We do it not alone, sir.        MENENIUS.   I know you can do very little alone, for your helps are many, or else your  actions would grow wondrous single. Your abilities are too infantlike for  doing much alone. You talk of pride. O that you could turn your eyes toward the  napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves! O,  that you could!        BOTH TRIBUNES.   What then, sir?        MENENIUS.   Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, proud, violent, testy  magistrates, alias fools, as any in Rome.        SICINIUS.   Menenius, you are known well enough, too.        MENENIUS.   I am known to be a humorous patrician and one that loves a cup of hot wine  with not a drop of allaying Tiber in’t; said to be something imperfect in  favouring the first complaint, hasty and tinder-like upon too trivial motion;  one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of  the morning. What I think I utter, and spend my malice in my breath. Meeting  two such wealsmen as you are—I cannot call you Lycurguses—if the drink you  give me touch my palate adversely, I make a crooked face at it. I cannot say  your Worships have delivered the matter well when I find the ass in compound  with the major part of your syllables. And though I must be content to bear  with those that say you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that tell  you have good faces. If you see this in the map of my microcosm, follows it  that I am known well enough too? What harm can your bisson conspectuities glean  out of this character, if I be known well enough, too?        BRUTUS.   Come, sir, come; we know you well enough.        MENENIUS.   You know neither me, yourselves, nor anything. You are ambitious for poor  knaves’ caps and legs. You wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a  cause between an orange-wife and a faucet-seller, and then rejourn the  controversy of threepence to a second day of audience. When you are hearing a  matter between party and party, if you chance to be pinched with the colic, you  make faces like mummers, set up the bloody flag against all patience, and, in  roaring for a chamber pot, dismiss the controversy bleeding, the more entangled  by your hearing. All the peace you make in their cause is calling both the  parties knaves. You are a pair of strange ones.        BRUTUS.   Come, come. You are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than  a necessary bencher in the Capitol.        MENENIUS.   Our very priests must become mockers if they shall encounter such ridiculous  subjects as you are. When you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the  wagging of your beards, and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to  stuff a botcher’s cushion or to be entombed in an ass’s packsaddle. Yet you  must be saying Martius is proud, who, in a cheap estimation, is worth all your  predecessors since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the best of ’em were  hereditary hangmen. Good e’en to your Worships. More of your conversation would  infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians. I will be bold to  take my leave of you.        [ He begins to exit.  Brutus  and   Sicinius  stand aside. ]        Enter  Volumnia, Virgilia  and   Valeria         How now, my as fair as noble ladies—and the moon, were she earthly, no  nobler—whither do you follow your eyes so fast?        VOLUMNIA.   Honourable Menenius, my boy Martius approaches. For the love of Juno, let’s go!        MENENIUS.   Ha? Martius coming home?        VOLUMNIA.   Ay, worthy Menenius, and with most prosperous approbation.        MENENIUS.   Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee! Hoo! Martius coming home?        VALERIA, VIRGILIA.   Nay, ’tis true.        VOLUMNIA.   Look, here’s a letter from him. The state hath another, his wife another, and I  think there’s one at home for you.        MENENIUS.   I will make my very house reel tonight. A letter for me?        VIRGILIA.   Yes, certain, there’s a letter for you; I saw it.        MENENIUS.   A letter for me? It gives me an estate of seven years’ health, in which time I  will make a lip at the physician. The most sovereign prescription in Galen is  but empiricutic and, to this preservative, of no better report than a  horse drench. Is he not wounded? He was wont to come home wounded.        VIRGILIA.   O, no, no, no!        VOLUMNIA.   O, he is wounded, I thank the gods for’t.        MENENIUS.   So do I too, if it be not too much. Brings he victory in his pocket, the wounds  become him.        VOLUMNIA.   On’s brows, Menenius. He comes the third time home with the oaken garland.        MENENIUS.   Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?        VOLUMNIA.   Titus Lartius writes they fought together, but Aufidius got off.        MENENIUS.   And ’twas time for him too, I’ll warrant him that. An he had stayed by him, I  would not have been so ’fidiused for all the chests in Corioles and the gold  that’s in them. Is the Senate possessed of this?        VOLUMNIA.   Good ladies, let’s go.—Yes, yes, yes. The Senate has letters from the General,  wherein he gives my son the whole name of the war. He hath in this action  outdone his former deeds doubly.        VALERIA.   In troth, there’s wondrous things spoke of him.        MENENIUS.   Wondrous? Ay, I warrant you, and not without his true purchasing.        VIRGILIA.   The gods grant them true.        VOLUMNIA.   True? Pow, waw!        MENENIUS.   True? I’ll be sworn they are true. Where is he wounded? [ To the  Tribunes .] God save your good Worships! Martius is coming home; he has more  cause to be proud.—Where is he wounded?        VOLUMNIA.   I’ th’ shoulder and i’ th’ left arm. There will be large cicatrices to show the  people when he shall stand for his place. He received in the repulse of Tarquin  seven hurts i’ th’ body.        MENENIUS.   One i’ th’ neck and two i’ th’ thigh—there’s nine that I know.        VOLUMNIA.   He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five wounds upon him.        MENENIUS.   Now it’s twenty-seven. Every gash was an enemy’s grave.         [ A shout and flourish .]        Hark, the trumpets!        VOLUMNIA.   These are the ushers of Martius: before him he carries noise, and behind him he  leaves tears.   Death, that dark spirit, in’s nervy arm doth lie,   Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.        [ A sennet .]        Enter  Cominius  the General and  Titus Lartius , between them  Coriolanus  crowned with an oaken garland, with  Captains  and Soldiers and a  Herald . Trumpets sound.        HERALD.   Know, Rome, that all alone Martius did fight   Within Corioles’ gates, where he hath won,   With fame, a name to Caius Martius; these   In honour follows “Coriolanus.”   Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus.      [ Sound flourish. ]      ALL.   Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!        CORIOLANUS.   No more of this, it does offend my heart.   Pray now, no more.        COMINIUS.   Look, sir, your mother.        CORIOLANUS.   O,   You have, I know, petitioned all the gods   For my prosperity.      [ Kneels. ]      VOLUMNIA.   Nay, my good soldier, up.      [ He stands. ]      My gentle Martius, worthy Caius, and   By deed-achieving honour newly named—   What is it? Coriolanus must I call thee?   But, O, thy wife—        CORIOLANUS.   My gracious silence, hail.   Wouldst thou have laughed had I come coffined home,   That weep’st to see me triumph? Ah, my dear,   Such eyes the widows in Corioles wear   And mothers that lack sons.        MENENIUS.   Now the gods crown thee!        CORIOLANUS.   And live you yet? [ To Valeria ] O my sweet lady, pardon.        VOLUMNIA.   I know not where to turn. O, welcome home!   And welcome, general.—And you’re welcome all.        MENENIUS.   A hundred thousand welcomes! I could weep,   And I could laugh; I am light and heavy. Welcome.   A curse begin at very root on’s heart   That is not glad to see thee! You are three   That Rome should dote on; yet, by the faith of men,   We have some old crab trees here at home that will not   Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors!   We call a nettle but a nettle, and   The faults of fools but folly.        COMINIUS.   Ever right.        CORIOLANUS.   Menenius ever, ever.        HERALD.   Give way there, and go on!        CORIOLANUS.   [ To Volumnia and Virgilia .] Your hand, and yours.   Ere in our own house I do shade my head,   The good patricians must be visited,   From whom I have received not only greetings,   But with them change of honours.        VOLUMNIA.   I have lived   To see inherited my very wishes   And the buildings of my fancy. Only   There’s one thing wanting, which I doubt not but   Our Rome will cast upon thee.        CORIOLANUS.   Know, good mother,   I had rather be their servant in my way   Than sway with them in theirs.        COMINIUS.   On, to the Capitol.      [ Flourish of cornets. Exeunt in state, as before. ]       Brutus  and   Sicinius  come forward.        BRUTUS.   All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights   Are spectacled to see him. Your prattling nurse   Into a rapture lets her baby cry   While she chats him. The kitchen malkin pins   Her richest lockram ’bout her reechy neck,   Clamb’ring the walls to eye him. Stalls, bulks, windows   Are smothered up, leads filled, and ridges horsed   With variable complexions, all agreeing   In earnestness to see him. Seld-shown flamens   Do press among the popular throngs and puff   To win a vulgar station. Our veiled dames   Commit the war of white and damask in   Their nicely-gauded cheeks to th’ wanton spoil   Of Phoebus’ burning kisses. Such a pother,   As if that whatsoever god who leads him   Were slyly crept into his human powers   And gave him graceful posture.        SICINIUS.   On the sudden   I warrant him consul.        BRUTUS.   Then our office may,   During his power, go sleep.        SICINIUS.   He cannot temp’rately transport his honours   From where he should begin and end, but will   Lose those he hath won.        BRUTUS.   In that there’s comfort.        SICINIUS.   Doubt not the commoners, for whom we stand,   But they, upon their ancient malice will forget   With the least cause these his new honours—which   That he will give them make as little question   As he is proud to do’t.        BRUTUS.   I heard him swear,   Were he to stand for consul, never would he   Appear i’ th’ marketplace nor on him put   The napless vesture of humility,   Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds   To th’ people, beg their stinking breaths.        SICINIUS.   ’Tis right.        BRUTUS.   It was his word. O, he would miss it rather   Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him   And the desire of the nobles.        SICINIUS.   I wish no better   Than have him hold that purpose and to put it   In execution.        BRUTUS.   ’Tis most like he will.        SICINIUS.   It shall be to him then, as our good wills,   A sure destruction.        BRUTUS.   So it must fall out   To him, or our authorities for an end.   We must suggest the people in what hatred   He still hath held them; that to’s power he would   Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders, and   Dispropertied their freedoms; holding them   In human action and capacity   Of no more soul nor fitness for the world   Than camels in their war, who have their provand   Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows   For sinking under them.        SICINIUS.   This, as you say, suggested   At some time when his soaring insolence   Shall touch the people—which time shall not want   If it be put upon’t, and that’s as easy   As to set dogs on sheep—will be his fire   To kindle their dry stubble, and their blaze   Shall darken him for ever.        Enter a  Messenger .        BRUTUS.   What’s the matter?        MESSENGER.   You are sent for to the Capitol. ’Tis thought   That Martius shall be consul. I have seen   The dumb men throng to see him, and the blind   to hear him speak; matrons flung gloves,   Ladies and maids their scarves and handkerchiefs,   Upon him as he passed; the nobles bended   As to Jove’s statue, and the Commons made   A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.   I never saw the like.        BRUTUS.   Let’s to the Capitol;   And carry with us ears and eyes for th’ time,   But hearts for the event.        SICINIUS.   Have with you.      [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE II. Rome. The Capitol       Enter two  Officers , to lay cushions, as it were  in the Capitol.        FIRST OFFICER.   Come, come. They are almost here. How many stand for consulships?        SECOND OFFICER.   Three, they say; but ’tis thought of everyone Coriolanus will carry it.        FIRST OFFICER.   That’s a brave fellow, but he’s vengeance proud and loves not the common  people.        SECOND OFFICER.   ’Faith, there have been many great men that have flattered the people who ne’er  loved them; and there be many that they have loved they know not wherefore; so  that, if they love they know not why, they hate upon no better a ground.  Therefore, for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him  manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition and, out of his noble  carelessness, lets them plainly see’t.        FIRST OFFICER.   If he did not care whether he had their love or no, he waved indifferently  ’twixt doing them neither good nor harm; but he seeks their hate with greater  devotion than they can render it him and leaves nothing undone that may fully  discover him their opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and displeasure  of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes, to flatter them for their  love.        SECOND OFFICER.   He hath deserved worthily of his country, and his ascent is not by such easy  degrees as those who, having been supple and courteous to the people,  bonnetted, without any further deed to have them at all into their estimation  and report; but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions  in their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess so much  were a kind of ingrateful injury. To report otherwise were a malice that,  giving itself the lie, would pluck reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard  it.        FIRST OFFICER.   No more of him; he’s a worthy man. Make way. They are coming.        A sennet. Enter the Patricians and the Tribunes of the people, Lictors before  them;  Coriolanus, Menenius, Cominius  the consul.  The Patricians sit.   Sicinius  and  Brutus  take their places by themselves.  Coriolanus  stands.        MENENIUS.   Having determined of the Volsces and   To send for Titus Lartius, it remains,   As the main point of this our after-meeting,   To gratify his noble service that   Hath thus stood for his country. Therefore please you,   Most reverend and grave elders, to desire   The present consul and last general   In our well-found successes to report   A little of that worthy work performed   By Martius Caius Coriolanus, whom   We met here both to thank and to remember   With honours like himself.      [  Coriolanus  sits. ]      FIRST SENATOR.   Speak, good Cominius.   Leave nothing out for length, and make us think   Rather our state’s defective for requital,   Than we to stretch it out. Masters o’ th’ people,   We do request your kindest ears and, after,   Your loving motion toward the common body   To yield what passes here.        SICINIUS.   We are convented   Upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts   Inclinable to honour and advance   The theme of our assembly.        BRUTUS.   Which the rather   We shall be blest to do if he remember   A kinder value of the people than   He hath hereto prized them at.        MENENIUS.   That’s off, that’s off!   I would you rather had been silent. Please you   To hear Cominius speak?        BRUTUS.   Most willingly.   But yet my caution was more pertinent   Than the rebuke you give it.        MENENIUS.   He loves your people,   But tie him not to be their bedfellow.—   Worthy Cominius, speak.      [  Coriolanus  rises, and offers  to go away. ]      Nay, keep your place.        FIRST SENATOR.   Sit, Coriolanus. Never shame to hear   What you have nobly done.        CORIOLANUS.   Your Honours, pardon.   I had rather have my wounds to heal again   Than hear say how I got them.        BRUTUS.   Sir, I hope   My words disbenched you not?        CORIOLANUS.   No, sir. Yet oft,   When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.   You soothed not, therefore hurt not; but your people,   I love them as they weigh.        MENENIUS.   Pray now, sit down.        CORIOLANUS.   I had rather have one scratch my head i’ th’ sun   When the alarum were struck than idly sit   To hear my nothings monstered.      [ Exit. ]      MENENIUS.   Masters of the people,   Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter—   That’s thousand to one good one—when you now see   He had rather venture all his limbs for honour   Than one on’s ears to hear it?—Proceed, Cominius.        COMINIUS.   I shall lack voice. The deeds of Coriolanus   Should not be uttered feebly. It is held   That valour is the chiefest virtue and   Most dignifies the haver; if it be,   The man I speak of cannot in the world   Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,   When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought   Beyond the mark of others. Our then dictator,   Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight   When with his Amazonian chin he drove   The bristled lips before him. He bestrid   An o’erpressed Roman and i’ th’ Consul’s view   Slew three opposers. Tarquin’s self he met   And struck him on his knee. In that day’s feats,   When he might act the woman in the scene,   He proved best man i’ th’ field and for his meed   Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age   Man-entered thus, he waxed like a sea,   And in the brunt of seventeen battles since   He lurched all swords of the garland. For this last,   Before and in Corioles, let me say,   I cannot speak him home. He stopped the flyers   And by his rare example made the coward   Turn terror into sport. As weeds before   A vessel under sail, so men obeyed   And fell below his stem. His sword, Death’s stamp,   Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot   He was a thing of blood, whose every motion   Was timed with dying cries. Alone he entered   The mortal gate o’ th’ city, which he painted   With shunless destiny; aidless came off   And with a sudden reinforcement struck   Corioles like a planet. Now all’s his,   When by and by the din of war gan pierce   His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit   Requickened what in flesh was fatigate,   And to the battle came he, where he did   Run reeking o’er the lives of men as if   ’Twere a perpetual spoil; and till we called   Both field and city ours, he never stood   To ease his breast with panting.        MENENIUS.   Worthy man!        FIRST SENATOR.   He cannot but with measure fit the honours   Which we devise him.        COMINIUS.   Our spoils he kicked at;   And looked upon things precious as they were   The common muck of the world. He covets less   Than misery itself would give, rewards   His deeds with doing them, and is content   To spend the time to end it.        MENENIUS.   He’s right noble.   Let him be called for.        FIRST SENATOR.   Call Coriolanus.        OFFICER.   He doth appear.        Enter  Coriolanus .        MENENIUS.   The Senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased   To make thee consul.        CORIOLANUS.   I do owe them still   My life and services.        MENENIUS.   It then remains   That you do speak to the people.        CORIOLANUS.   I do beseech you   Let me o’erleap that custom, for I cannot   Put on the gown, stand naked, and entreat them   For my wounds’ sake to give their suffrage. Please you   That I may pass this doing.        SICINIUS.   Sir, the people   Must have their voices; neither will they bate   One jot of ceremony.        MENENIUS.   Put them not to’t.   Pray you, go fit you to the custom, and   Take to you, as your predecessors have,   Your honour with your form.        CORIOLANUS.   It is a part   That I shall blush in acting, and might well   Be taken from the people.        BRUTUS.   Mark you that?        CORIOLANUS.   To brag unto them, “thus I did, and thus!”   Show them th’ unaching scars which I should hide,   As if I had received them for the hire   Of their breath only!        MENENIUS.   Do not stand upon’t.—   We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,   Our purpose to them, and to our noble consul   Wish we all joy and honour.        SENATORS.   To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!        [ Flourish cornets. Exeunt all but  Sicinius  and   Brutus . ]        BRUTUS.   You see how he intends to use the people.        SICINIUS.   May they perceive’s intent! He will require them   As if he did contemn what he requested   Should be in them to give.        BRUTUS.   Come, we’ll inform them   Of our proceedings here. On th’ marketplace   I know they do attend us.      [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE III. Rome. The Forum       Enter seven or eight Citizens.        FIRST CITIZEN.   Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.        SECOND CITIZEN.   We may, sir, if we will.        THIRD CITIZEN.   We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a power that we have no power to  do; for, if he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our  tongues into those wounds and speak for them. So, if he tell us his noble  deeds, we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is  monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a monster of the  multitude, of the which we being members, should bring ourselves to be  monstrous members.        FIRST CITIZEN.   And to make us no better thought of, a little help will serve; for once we  stood up about the corn, he himself stuck not to call us the many-headed  multitude.        THIRD CITIZEN.   We have been called so of many; not that our heads are some brown, some black,  some auburn, some bald, but that our wits are so diversely coloured; and truly  I think if all our wits were to issue out of one skull, they would fly east,  west, north, south, and their consent of one direct way should be at once to  all the points o’ th’ compass.        SECOND CITIZEN.   Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would fly?        THIRD CITIZEN.   Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man’s will; ’tis strongly wedged  up in a blockhead. But if it were at liberty, ’twould, sure, southward.        SECOND CITIZEN.   Why that way?        THIRD CITIZEN.   To lose itself in a fog, where being three parts melted away with rotten dews,  the fourth would return for conscience’ sake, to help to get thee a wife.        SECOND CITIZEN.   You are never without your tricks. You may, you may.        THIRD CITIZEN.   Are you all resolved to give your voices? But that’s no matter; the greater  part carries it. I say, if he would incline to the people, there was never a  worthier man.        Enter  Coriolanus  in a gown of humility, with   Menenius .        Here he comes, and in the gown of humility. Mark his behaviour.  We are not to stay all together, but to come by him where he stands, by ones,  by twos, and by threes. He’s to make his requests by particulars, wherein  everyone of us has a single honour in giving him our own voices with our own  tongues. Therefore follow me, and I’ll direct you how you shall go by him.        ALL.   Content, content.      [ Exeunt. ]      MENENIUS.   O sir, you are not right. Have you not known   The worthiest men have done’t?        CORIOLANUS.   What must I say?   “I pray, sir”—plague upon’t! I cannot bring   My tongue to such a pace. “Look, sir, my wounds!   I got them in my country’s service when   Some certain of your brethren roared and ran   From th’ noise of our own drums.”        MENENIUS.   O me, the gods!   You must not speak of that. You must desire them   To think upon you.        CORIOLANUS.   Think upon me! Hang ’em!   I would they would forget me, like the virtues   Which our divines lose by ’em.        MENENIUS.   You’ll mar all.   I’ll leave you. Pray you speak to ’em, I pray you,   In wholesome manner.      [ Exit  Menenius . ]      CORIOLANUS.   Bid them wash their faces   And keep their teeth clean.        Enter three of the Citizens.        So, here comes a brace.   You know the cause, sirs, of my standing here.        THIRD CITIZEN.   We do, sir. Tell us what hath brought you to’t.        CORIOLANUS.   Mine own desert.        SECOND CITIZEN.   Your own desert?        CORIOLANUS.   Ay, but not mine own desire.        THIRD CITIZEN.   How, not your own desire?        CORIOLANUS.   No, sir, ’twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging.        THIRD CITIZEN.   You must think if we give you anything, we hope to gain by you.        CORIOLANUS.   Well then, I pray, your price o’ th’ consulship?        FIRST CITIZEN.   The price is to ask it kindly.        CORIOLANUS.   Kindly, sir, I pray, let me ha’t. I have wounds to show you, which shall be  yours in private.—Your good voice, sir. What say you?        SECOND CITIZEN.   You shall ha’ it, worthy sir.        CORIOLANUS.   A match, sir. There’s in all two worthy voices begged. I have your alms. Adieu.        THIRD CITIZEN.   But this is something odd.        SECOND CITIZEN.   An ’twere to give again—but ’tis no matter.      [ Exeunt two citizens. ]      Enter two other Citizens.        CORIOLANUS.   Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your voices that I may be  consul, I have here the customary gown.        FOURTH CITIZEN.   You have deserved nobly of your country, and you have not deserved nobly.        CORIOLANUS.   Your enigma?        FOURTH CITIZEN.   You have been a scourge to her enemies; you have been a rod to her friends. You  have not indeed loved the common people.        CORIOLANUS.   You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my  love. I will, sir, flatter my sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer  estimation of them; ’tis a condition they account gentle. And since the wisdom  of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise the  insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly. That is, sir, I will  counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man and give it bountiful to the  desirers. Therefore, beseech you, I may be consul.        FIFTH CITIZEN.   We hope to find you our friend, and therefore give you our voices heartily.        FOURTH CITIZEN.   You have received many wounds for your country.        CORIOLANUS.   I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I will make much of your  voices and so trouble you no farther.        BOTH CITIZENS.   The gods give you joy, sir, heartily.      [ Exeunt citizens. ]      CORIOLANUS.   Most sweet voices!   Better it is to die, better to starve,   Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.   Why in this wolvish toge should I stand here   To beg of Hob and Dick that does appear   Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to’t.   What custom wills, in all things should we do’t?   The dust on antique time would lie unswept   And mountainous error be too highly heaped   For truth to o’erpeer. Rather than fool it so,   Let the high office and the honour go   To one that would do thus. I am half through;   The one part suffered, the other will I do.         Enter three Citizens more.        Here come more voices.   Your voices! For your voices I have fought;   Watched for your voices; for your voices bear   Of wounds two dozen odd. Battles thrice six   I have seen and heard of; for your voices have   Done many things, some less, some more. Your voices!   Indeed, I would be consul.        SIXTH CITIZEN.   He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest man’s voice.        SEVENTH CITIZEN.   Therefore let him be consul. The gods give him joy, and make him good friend to  the people!        ALL THREE CITIZENS.   Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul.      [ Exeunt citizens. ]      CORIOLANUS.   Worthy voices!        Enter  Menenius  with   Brutus  and  Sicinius .        MENENIUS.   You have stood your limitation, and the Tribunes   Endue you with the people’s voice. Remains   That in th’ official marks invested, you   Anon do meet the Senate.        CORIOLANUS.   Is this done?        SICINIUS.   The custom of request you have discharged.   The people do admit you, and are summoned   To meet anon upon your approbation.        CORIOLANUS.   Where? At the Senate House?        SICINIUS.   There, Coriolanus.        CORIOLANUS.   May I change these garments?        SICINIUS.   You may, sir.        CORIOLANUS.   That I’ll straight do and, knowing myself again,   Repair to th’ Senate House.        MENENIUS.   I’ll keep you company.—Will you along?        BRUTUS.   We stay here for the people.        SICINIUS.   Fare you well.        [ Exeunt  Coriolanus  and   Menenius . ]        He has it now; and by his looks, methinks,   ’Tis warm at his heart.        BRUTUS.   With a proud heart he wore   His humble weeds. Will you dismiss the people?        Enter the Pebleians.        SICINIUS.   How now, my masters, have you chose this man?        FIRST CITIZEN.   He has our voices, sir.        BRUTUS.   We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.        SECOND CITIZEN.   Amen, sir. To my poor unworthy notice,   He mocked us when he begged our voices.        THIRD CITIZEN.   Certainly, he flouted us downright.        FIRST CITIZEN.   No, ’tis his kind of speech. He did not mock us.        SECOND CITIZEN.   Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says   He used us scornfully. He should have showed us   His marks of merit, wounds received for’s country.        SICINIUS.   Why, so he did, I am sure.        ALL.   No, no. No man saw ’em.        THIRD CITIZEN.   He said he had wounds, which he could show in private,   And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,   “I would be consul,” says he; “aged custom,   But by your voices, will not so permit me;   Your voices therefore.” When we granted that,   Here was “I thank you for your voices. Thank you.   Your most sweet voices! Now you have left your voices,   I have no further with you.” Was not this mockery?        SICINIUS.   Why either were you ignorant to see’t   Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness   To yield your voices?        BRUTUS.   Could you not have told him   As you were lessoned? When he had no power,   But was a petty servant to the state,   He was your enemy, ever spake against   Your liberties and the charters that you bear   I’ th’ body of the weal; and, now arriving   A place of potency and sway o’ th’ state,   If he should still malignantly remain   Fast foe to th’ plebeii, your voices might   Be curses to yourselves. You should have said   That as his worthy deeds did claim no less   Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature   Would think upon you for your voices, and   Translate his malice towards you into love,   Standing your friendly lord.        SICINIUS.   Thus to have said,   As you were fore-advised, had touched his spirit   And tried his inclination; from him plucked   Either his gracious promise, which you might,   As cause had called you up, have held him to;   Or else it would have galled his surly nature,   Which easily endures not article   Tying him to aught. So putting him to rage,   You should have ta’en th’ advantage of his choler   And passed him unelected.        BRUTUS.   Did you perceive   He did solicit you in free contempt   When he did need your loves, and do you think   That his contempt shall not be bruising to you   When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies   No heart among you? Or had you tongues to cry   Against the rectorship of judgment?        SICINIUS.   Have you ere now denied the asker, and now   Again, of him that did not ask but mock,   Bestow your sued-for tongues?        THIRD CITIZEN.   He’s not confirmed.   We may deny him yet.        SECOND CITIZEN.   And will deny him.   I’ll have five hundred voices of that sound.        FIRST CITIZEN.   I twice five hundred, and their friends to piece ’em.        BRUTUS.   Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends   They have chose a consul that will from them take   Their liberties, make them of no more voice   Than dogs that are as often beat for barking   As therefore kept to do so.        SICINIUS.   Let them assemble   And, on a safer judgment, all revoke   Your ignorant election. Enforce his pride   And his old hate unto you. Besides, forget not   With what contempt he wore the humble weed,   How in his suit he scorned you; but your loves,   Thinking upon his services, took from you   Th’ apprehension of his present portance,   Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion   After the inveterate hate he bears you.        BRUTUS.   Lay   A fault on us, your tribunes, that we laboured,   No impediment between, but that you must   Cast your election on him.        SICINIUS.   Say you chose him   More after our commandment than as guided   By your own true affections, and that your minds,   Preoccupied with what you rather must do   Than what you should, made you against the grain   To voice him consul. Lay the fault on us.        BRUTUS.   Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you,   How youngly he began to serve his country,   How long continued, and what stock he springs of,   The noble house o’ th’ Martians, from whence came   That Ancus Martius, Numa’s daughter’s son,   Who, after great Hostilius here was king,   Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,   That our best water brought by conduits hither;   And Censorinus, that was so surnamed,   And nobly named so, twice being censor,   Was his great ancestor.        SICINIUS.   One thus descended,   That hath beside well in his person wrought   To be set high in place, we did commend   To your remembrances; but you have found,   Scaling his present bearing with his past,   That he’s your fixed enemy, and revoke   Your sudden approbation.        BRUTUS.   Say you ne’er had done’t—   Harp on that still—but by our putting on.   And presently when you have drawn your number,   Repair to th’ Capitol.        ALL.   We will so. Almost all   Repent in their election.      [ Exeunt Plebeians. ]      BRUTUS.   Let them go on.   This mutiny were better put in hazard   Than stay, past doubt, for greater.   If, as his nature is, he fall in rage   With their refusal, both observe and answer   The vantage of his anger.        SICINIUS.   To th’ Capitol, come.   We will be there before the stream o’ th’ people,   And this shall seem, as partly ’tis, their own,   Which we have goaded onward.      [ Exeunt. ]               ACT III       SCENE I. Rome. A street       Cornets. Enter  Coriolanus, Menenius,  all the  Gentry,  Cominius, Titus Lartius  and other  Senators.        CORIOLANUS.   Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?        LARTIUS.   He had, my lord, and that it was which caused   Our swifter composition.        CORIOLANUS.   So then the Volsces stand but as at first,   Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road   Upon’s again.        COMINIUS.   They are worn, lord consul, so   That we shall hardly in our ages see   Their banners wave again.        CORIOLANUS.   Saw you Aufidius?        LARTIUS.   On safeguard he came to me, and did curse   Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely   Yielded the town. He is retired to Antium.        CORIOLANUS.   Spoke he of me?        LARTIUS.   He did, my lord.        CORIOLANUS.   How? What?        LARTIUS.   How often he had met you sword to sword;   That of all things upon the earth he hated   Your person most; that he would pawn his fortunes   To hopeless restitution, so he might   Be called your vanquisher.        CORIOLANUS.   At Antium lives he?        LARTIUS.   At Antium.        CORIOLANUS.   I wish I had a cause to seek him there,   To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.        Enter  Sicinius  and   Brutus .        Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,   The tongues o’ th’ common mouth. I do despise them,   For they do prank them in authority   Against all noble sufferance.        SICINIUS.   Pass no further.        CORIOLANUS.   Ha? What is that?        BRUTUS.   It will be dangerous to go on. No further.        CORIOLANUS.   What makes this change?        MENENIUS.   The matter?        COMINIUS.   Hath he not passed the noble and the common?        BRUTUS.   Cominius, no.        CORIOLANUS.   Have I had children’s voices?        FIRST SENATOR.   Tribunes, give way. He shall to the marketplace.        BRUTUS.   The people are incensed against him.        SICINIUS.   Stop,   Or all will fall in broil.        CORIOLANUS.   Are these your herd?   Must these have voices, that can yield them now   And straight disclaim their tongues? What are your offices?   You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?   Have you not set them on?        MENENIUS.   Be calm, be calm.        CORIOLANUS.   It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,   To curb the will of the nobility.   Suffer’t, and live with such as cannot rule   Nor ever will be ruled.        BRUTUS.   Call’t not a plot.   The people cry you mocked them; and, of late,   When corn was given them gratis, you repined,   Scandaled the suppliants for the people, called them   Timepleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.        CORIOLANUS.   Why, this was known before.        BRUTUS.   Not to them all.        CORIOLANUS.   Have you informed them sithence?        BRUTUS.   How? I inform them?        COMINIUS.   You are like to do such business.        BRUTUS.   Not unlike, each way, to better yours.        CORIOLANUS.   Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,   Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me   Your fellow tribune.        SICINIUS.   You show too much of that   For which the people stir. If you will pass   To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,   Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,   Or never be so noble as a consul,   Nor yoke with him for tribune.        MENENIUS.   Let’s be calm.        COMINIUS.   The people are abused, set on. This palt’ring   Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus   Deserved this so dishonoured rub, laid falsely   I’ th’ plain way of his merit.        CORIOLANUS.   Tell me of corn?   This was my speech, and I will speak’t again.        MENENIUS.   Not now, not now.        FIRST SENATOR.   Not in this heat, sir, now.        CORIOLANUS.   Now, as I live, I will.   My nobler friends, I crave their pardons. For   The mutable, rank-scented many, let them   Regard me, as I do not flatter, and   Therein behold themselves. I say again,   In soothing them we nourish ’gainst our senate   The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,   Which we ourselves have ploughed for, sowed, and scattered   By mingling them with us, the honoured number,   Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that   Which they have given to beggars.        MENENIUS.   Well, no more.        FIRST SENATOR.   No more words, we beseech you.        CORIOLANUS.   How? No more?   As for my country I have shed my blood,   Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs   Coin words till their decay against those measles   Which we disdain should tetter us, yet sought   The very way to catch them.        BRUTUS.   You speak o’ th’ people   As if you were a god to punish, not   A man of their infirmity.        SICINIUS.   ’Twere well   We let the people know’t.        MENENIUS.   What, what? His choler?        CORIOLANUS.   Choler?   Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,   By Jove, ’twould be my mind.        SICINIUS.   It is a mind   That shall remain a poison where it is,   Not poison any further.        CORIOLANUS.   “Shall remain”?   Hear you this Triton of the minnows? Mark you   His absolute “shall”?        COMINIUS.   ’Twas from the canon.        CORIOLANUS.   “Shall”?   O good but most unwise patricians, why,   You grave but reckless senators, have you thus   Given Hydra leave to choose an officer,   That with his peremptory “shall,” being but   The horn and noise o’ th’ monster’s, wants not spirit   To say he’ll turn your current in a ditch   And make your channel his? If he have power,   Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake   Your dangerous lenity. If you are learned,   Be not as common fools; if you are not,   Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,   If they be senators; and they are no less   When, both your voices blended, the great’st taste   Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,   And such a one as he, who puts his “shall,”   His popular “shall,” against a graver bench   Than ever frowned in Greece. By Jove himself,   It makes the consuls base! And my soul aches   To know, when two authorities are up,   Neither supreme, how soon confusion   May enter ’twixt the gap of both and take   The one by th’ other.        COMINIUS.   Well, on to th’ marketplace.        CORIOLANUS.   Whoever gave that counsel to give forth   The corn o’ th’ storehouse gratis, as ’twas used   Sometime in Greece—        MENENIUS.   Well, well, no more of that.        CORIOLANUS.   Though there the people had more absolute power,   I say they nourished disobedience, fed   The ruin of the state.        BRUTUS.   Why shall the people give   One that speaks thus their voice?        CORIOLANUS.   I’ll give my reasons,   More worthier than their voices. They know the corn   Was not our recompense, resting well assured   They ne’er did service for’t. Being pressed to th’ war,   Even when the navel of the state was touched,   They would not thread the gates. This kind of service   Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i’ th’ war,   Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they showed   Most valour, spoke not for them. Th’ accusation   Which they have often made against the Senate,   All cause unborn, could never be the native   Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?   How shall this bosom multitude digest   The senate’s courtesy? Let deeds express   What’s like to be their words: “We did request it;   We are the greater poll, and in true fear   They gave us our demands.” Thus we debase   The nature of our seats and make the rabble   Call our cares fears, which will in time   Break ope the locks o’ th’ Senate and bring in   The crows to peck the eagles.        MENENIUS.   Come, enough.        BRUTUS.   Enough, with over-measure.        CORIOLANUS.   No, take more!   What may be sworn by, both divine and human,   Seal what I end withal! This double worship—   Where one part does disdain with cause, the other   Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom   Cannot conclude but by the yea and no   Of general ignorance—it must omit   Real necessities and give way the while   To unstable slightness. Purpose so barred, it follows   Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you—   You that will be less fearful than discreet,   That love the fundamental part of state   More than you doubt the change on’t, that prefer   A noble life before a long, and wish   To jump a body with a dangerous physic   That’s sure of death without it—at once pluck out   The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick   The sweet which is their poison. Your dishonour   Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state   Of that integrity which should become’t,   Not having the power to do the good it would   For th’ ill which doth control’t.        BRUTUS.   ’Has said enough.        SICINIUS.   ’Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer   As traitors do.        CORIOLANUS.   Thou wretch, despite o’erwhelm thee!   What should the people do with these bald tribunes,   On whom depending, their obedience fails   To th’ greater bench. In a rebellion,   When what’s not meet but what must be was law,   Then were they chosen. In a better hour,   Let what is meet be said it must be meet,   And throw their power i’ th’ dust.        BRUTUS.   Manifest treason.        SICINIUS.   This a consul? No.        BRUTUS.   The aediles, ho! Let him be apprehended.        Enter an  Aedile .        SICINIUS.   Go call the people;      [ Exit  Aedile . ]      in whose name myself   Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,   A foe to th’ public weal. Obey, I charge thee,   And follow to thine answer.        CORIOLANUS.   Hence, old goat.        ALL PATRICIANS.   We’ll surety him.        COMINIUS.   [ to Sicinius .] Aged sir, hands off.        CORIOLANUS.   [ to Sicinius .] Hence, rotten thing, or I shall shake thy bones   Out of thy garments.        SICINIUS.   Help, ye citizens!        Enter a rabble of Plebeians with the  Aediles .        MENENIUS.   On both sides more respect!        SICINIUS.   Here’s he that would take from you all your power.        BRUTUS.   Seize him, aediles.        ALL PLEBEIANS.   Down with him, down with him!        SECOND SENATOR.   Weapons, weapons, weapons!      [ They all bustle about  Coriolanus . ]      Tribunes, patricians, citizens, what, ho!   Sicinius, Brutus, Coriolanus, citizens!        ALL.   Peace, peace, peace! Stay, hold, peace!        MENENIUS.   What is about to be? I am out of breath.   Confusion’s near. I cannot speak. You tribunes   To th’ people!—Coriolanus, patience!—   Speak, good Sicinius.        SICINIUS.   Hear me, people! Peace!        ALL PLEBEIANS.   Let’s hear our tribune. Peace! Speak, speak, speak.        SICINIUS.   You are at point to lose your liberties.   Martius would have all from you, Martius,   Whom late you have named for consul.        MENENIUS.   Fie, fie, fie!   This is the way to kindle, not to quench.        FIRST SENATOR.   To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.        SICINIUS.   What is the city but the people?        ALL PLEBEIANS.   True,   The people are the city.        BRUTUS.   By the consent of all, we were established   The people’s magistrates.        ALL PLEBEIANS.   You so remain.        MENENIUS.   And so are like to do.        COMINIUS.   That is the way to lay the city flat,   To bring the roof to the foundation   And bury all which yet distinctly ranges   In heaps and piles of ruin.        SICINIUS.   This deserves death.        BRUTUS.   Or let us stand to our authority   Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,   Upon the part o’ th’ people, in whose power   We were elected theirs, Martius is worthy   Of present death.        SICINIUS.   Therefore lay hold of him,   Bear him to th’ rock Tarpeian, and from thence   Into destruction cast him.        BRUTUS.   Aediles, seize him!        ALL PLEBEIANS.   Yield, Martius, yield!        MENENIUS.   Hear me one word.   Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.        AEDILES.   Peace, peace!        MENENIUS.   Be that you seem, truly your country’s friend,   And temp’rately proceed to what you would   Thus violently redress.        BRUTUS.   Sir, those cold ways,   That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous   Where the disease is violent.—Lay hands upon him,   And bear him to the rock.      [  Coriolanus  draws his sword. ]      CORIOLANUS.   No; I’ll die here.   There’s some among you have beheld me fighting.   Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.        MENENIUS.   Down with that sword!—Tribunes, withdraw awhile.        BRUTUS.   Lay hands upon him!        MENENIUS.   Help Martius, help!   You that be noble, help him, young and old!        ALL PLEBEIANS.   Down with him, down with him!        [ In this mutiny the  Tribunes , the   Aediles  and the People are beat in. ]        MENENIUS.   Go, get you to your house. Begone, away.   All will be naught else.        SECOND SENATOR.   Get you gone.        CORIOLANUS.   Stand fast!   We have as many friends as enemies.        MENENIUS.   Shall it be put to that?        FIRST SENATOR.   The gods forbid!   I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;   Leave us to cure this cause.        MENENIUS.   For ’tis a sore upon us   You cannot tent yourself. Begone, beseech you.        COMINIUS.   Come, sir, along with us.        CORIOLANUS.   I would they were barbarians, as they are,   Though in Rome littered, not Romans, as they are not,   Though calved i’ th’ porch o’ th’ Capitol.        MENENIUS.   Begone!   Put not your worthy rage into your tongue.   One time will owe another.        CORIOLANUS.   On fair ground   I could beat forty of them.        MENENIUS.   I could myself   Take up a brace o’ th’ best of them, yea, the two tribunes.        COMINIUS.   But now ’tis odds beyond arithmetic,   And manhood is called foolery when it stands   Against a falling fabric. Will you hence,   Before the tag return, whose rage doth rend   Like interrupted waters, and o’erbear   What they are used to bear?        MENENIUS.   Pray you, begone.   I’ll try whether my old wit be in request   With those that have but little. This must be patched   With cloth of any colour.        COMINIUS.   Nay, come away.      [ Exeunt  Coriolanus  and   Cominius . ]      PATRICIAN.   This man has marred his fortune.        MENENIUS.   His nature is too noble for the world.   He would not flatter Neptune for his trident   Or Jove for’s power to thunder. His heart’s his mouth;   What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent,   And, being angry, does forget that ever   He heard the name of death.      [ A noise within. ]      Here’s goodly work.        PATRICIAN.   I would they were abed!        MENENIUS.   I would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance,   Could he not speak ’em fair?        Enter  Brutus  and   Sicinius  with the rabble again.        SICINIUS.   Where is this viper   That would depopulate the city and   Be every man himself?        MENENIUS.   You worthy tribunes—        SICINIUS.   He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock   With rigorous hands. He hath resisted law,   And therefore law shall scorn him further trial   Than the severity of the public power   Which he so sets at naught.        FIRST CITIZEN.   He shall well know   The noble tribunes are the people’s mouths,   And we their hands.        ALL PLEBEIANS.   He shall, sure on’t.        MENENIUS.   Sir, sir—        SICINIUS.   Peace!        MENENIUS.   Do not cry havoc where you should but hunt   With modest warrant.        SICINIUS.   Sir, how comes’t that you   Have holp to make this rescue?        MENENIUS.   Hear me speak.   As I do know the Consul’s worthiness,   So can I name his faults.        SICINIUS.   Consul? What consul?        MENENIUS.   The consul Coriolanus.        BRUTUS.   He consul?        ALL PLEBEIANS.   No, no, no, no, no!        MENENIUS.   If, by the Tribunes’ leave, and yours, good people,   I may be heard, I would crave a word or two,   The which shall turn you to no further harm   Than so much loss of time.        SICINIUS.   Speak briefly then,   For we are peremptory to dispatch   This viperous traitor. To eject him hence   Were but one danger, and to keep him here   Our certain death. Therefore it is decreed   He dies tonight.        MENENIUS.   Now the good gods forbid   That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude   Towards her deserved children is enrolled   In Jove’s own book, like an unnatural dam   Should now eat up her own.        SICINIUS.   He’s a disease that must be cut away.        MENENIUS.   O, he’s a limb that has but a disease—   Mortal to cut it off; to cure it easy.   What has he done to Rome that’s worthy death?   Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost—   Which I dare vouch is more than that he hath   By many an ounce—he dropt it for his country;   And what is left, to lose it by his country   Were to us all, that do’t and suffer it   A brand to th’ end o’ th’ world.        SICINIUS.   This is clean cam.        BRUTUS.   Merely awry. When he did love his country,   It honoured him.        MENENIUS.   The service of the foot,   Being once gangrened, is not then respected   For what before it was.        BRUTUS.   We’ll hear no more.   Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence,   Lest his infection, being of catching nature,   Spread further.        MENENIUS.   One word more, one word!   This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find   The harm of unscanned swiftness, will too late,   Tie leaden pounds to’s heels. Proceed by process,   Lest parties—as he is beloved—break out   And sack great Rome with Romans.        BRUTUS.   If it were so—        SICINIUS.   What do ye talk?   Have we not had a taste of his obedience?   Our aediles smote! Ourselves resisted? Come.        MENENIUS.   Consider this: he has been bred i’ th’ wars   Since he could draw a sword, and is ill schooled   In bolted language; meal and bran together   He throws without distinction. Give me leave,   I’ll go to him and undertake to bring him   Where he shall answer by a lawful form,   In peace, to his utmost peril.        FIRST SENATOR.   Noble tribunes,   It is the humane way: the other course   Will prove too bloody, and the end of it   Unknown to the beginning.        SICINIUS.   Noble Menenius,   Be you then as the people’s officer.—   Masters, lay down your weapons.        BRUTUS.   Go not home.        SICINIUS.   Meet on the marketplace. We’ll attend you there,   Where if you bring not Martius, we’ll proceed   In our first way.        MENENIUS.   I’ll bring him to you.   [ To Senators .] Let me desire your company. He must come,   Or what is worst will follow.        FIRST SENATOR.   Pray you, let’s to him.      [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE II. Rome. A room in Coriolanus’s house       Enter  Coriolanus  with Nobles.        CORIOLANUS.   Let them pull all about mine ears, present me   Death on the wheel or at wild horses’ heels,   Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,   That the precipitation might down stretch   Below the beam of sight, yet will I still   Be thus to them.        FIRST PATRICIAN.   You do the nobler.        CORIOLANUS.   I muse my mother   Does not approve me further, who was wont   To call them woollen vassals, things created   To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads   In congregations, to yawn, be still, and wonder   When one but of my ordinance stood up   To speak of peace or war.        Enter  Volumnia .        I talk of you.   Why did you wish me milder? Would you have me   False to my nature? Rather say I play   The man I am.        VOLUMNIA.   O, sir, sir, sir,   I would have had you put your power well on   Before you had worn it out.        CORIOLANUS.   Let go.        VOLUMNIA.   You might have been enough the man you are   With striving less to be so. Lesser had been   The thwartings of your dispositions if   You had not showed them how ye were disposed   Ere they lacked power to cross you.        CORIOLANUS.   Let them hang!        VOLUMNIA.   Ay, and burn too.        Enter  Menenius  with the   Senators .        MENENIUS.   Come, come, you have been too rough, something too rough.   You must return and mend it.        FIRST SENATOR.   There’s no remedy,   Unless, by not so doing, our good city   Cleave in the midst and perish.        VOLUMNIA.   Pray be counselled.   I have a heart as little apt as yours,   But yet a brain that leads my use of anger   To better vantage.        MENENIUS.   Well said, noble woman.   Before he should thus stoop to th’ herd—but that   The violent fit o’ th’ time craves it as physic   For the whole state—I would put mine armour on,   Which I can scarcely bear.        CORIOLANUS.   What must I do?        MENENIUS.   Return to th’ Tribunes.        CORIOLANUS.   Well, what then? What then?        MENENIUS.   Repent what you have spoke.        CORIOLANUS.   For them? I cannot do it to the gods.   Must I then do’t to them?        VOLUMNIA.   You are too absolute,   Though therein you can never be too noble   But when extremities speak. I have heard you say   Honour and policy, like unsevered friends,   I’ th’ war do grow together. Grant that, and tell me   In peace what each of them by th’ other lose   That they combine not there.        CORIOLANUS.   Tush, tush!        MENENIUS.   A good demand.        VOLUMNIA.   If it be honour in your wars to seem   The same you are not, which for your best ends   You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse   That it shall hold companionship in peace   With honour as in war, since that to both   It stands in like request?        CORIOLANUS.   Why force you this?        VOLUMNIA.   Because that now it lies you on to speak   To th’ people, not by your own instruction,   Nor by th’ matter which your heart prompts you,   But with such words that are but rooted in   Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables   Of no allowance to your bosom’s truth.   Now, this no more dishonours you at all   Than to take in a town with gentle words,   Which else would put you to your fortune and   The hazard of much blood.   I would dissemble with my nature where   My fortunes and my friends at stake required   I should do so in honour. I am in this   Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;   And you will rather show our general louts   How you can frown than spend a fawn upon ’em   For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard   Of what that want might ruin.        MENENIUS.   Noble lady!—   Come, go with us; speak fair. You may salve so,   Not what is dangerous present, but the loss   Of what is past.        VOLUMNIA.   I prithee now, my son,   Go to them with this bonnet in thy hand,   And thus far having stretched it—here be with them—   Thy knee bussing the stones—for in such busines   Action is eloquence, and the eyes of th’ ignorant   More learned than the ears—waving thy head,   Which often thus correcting thy stout heart,   Now humble as the ripest mulberry   That will not hold the handling. Or say to them   Thou art their soldier and, being bred in broils,   Hast not the soft way, which thou dost confess   Were fit for thee to use, as they to claim,   In asking their good loves; but thou wilt frame   Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far   As thou hast power and person.        MENENIUS.   This but done   Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;   For they have pardons, being asked, as free   As words to little purpose.        VOLUMNIA.   Prithee now,   Go, and be ruled; although I know thou hadst rather   Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf   Than flatter him in a bower.        Enter  Cominius .        Here is Cominius.        COMINIUS.   I have been i’ th’ marketplace; and, sir, ’tis fit   You make strong party or defend yourself   By calmness or by absence. All’s in anger.        MENENIUS.   Only fair speech.        COMINIUS.   I think ’twill serve, if he   Can thereto frame his spirit.        VOLUMNIA.   He must, and will.—   Prithee, now, say you will, and go about it.        CORIOLANUS.   Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce? Must I   With my base tongue give to my noble heart   A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do’t.   Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,   This mould of Martius, they to dust should grind it   And throw’t against the wind. To th’ marketplace!   You have put me now to such a part which never   I shall discharge to th’ life.        COMINIUS.   Come, come, we’ll prompt you.        VOLUMNIA.   I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said   My praises made thee first a soldier, so,   To have my praise for this, perform a part   Thou hast not done before.        CORIOLANUS.   Well, I must do’t.   Away, my disposition, and possess me   Some harlot’s spirit! My throat of war be turned,   Which choired with my drum, into a pipe   Small as an eunuch or the virgin voice   That babies lulls asleep! The smiles of knaves   Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys’ tears take up   The glasses of my sight! A beggar’s tongue   Make motion through my lips, and my armed knees,   Who bowed but in my stirrup, bend like his   That hath received an alms! I will not do’t,   Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth   And, by my body’s action, teach my mind   A most inherent baseness.        VOLUMNIA.   At thy choice, then.   To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour   Than thou of them. Come all to ruin. Let   Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear   Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death   With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list.   Thy valiantness was mine; thou suck’dst it from me,   But owe thy pride thyself.        CORIOLANUS.   Pray, be content.   Mother, I am going to the marketplace.   Chide me no more. I’ll mountebank their loves,   Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved   Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going.   Commend me to my wife. I’ll return consul,   Or never trust to what my tongue can do   I’ th’ way of flattery further.        VOLUMNIA.   Do your will.      [ Exit  Volumnia . ]      COMINIUS.   Away! The Tribunes do attend you. Arm yourself   To answer mildly, for they are prepared   With accusations, as I hear, more strong   Than are upon you yet.        CORIOLANUS.   The word is “mildly.” Pray you, let us go.   Let them accuse me by invention, I   Will answer in mine honour.        MENENIUS.   Ay, but mildly.        CORIOLANUS.   Well, mildly be it, then. Mildly.      [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE III. Rome. The Forum       Enter  Sicinius  and   Brutus .        BRUTUS.   In this point charge him home, that he affects   Tyrannical power. If he evade us there,   Enforce him with his envy to the people,   And that the spoil got on the Antiates   Was ne’er distributed.        Enter an  Aedile .        What, will he come?        AEDILE.   He’s coming.        BRUTUS.   How accompanied?        AEDILE.   With old Menenius, and those senators   That always favoured him.        SICINIUS.   Have you a catalogue   Of all the voices that we have procured,   Set down by th’ poll?        AEDILE.   I have. ’Tis ready.        SICINIUS.   Have you collected them by tribes?        AEDILE.   I have.        SICINIUS.   Assemble presently the people hither;   And when they hear me say “It shall be so   I’ th’ right and strength o’ th’ commons,” be it either   For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them   If I say “Fine,” cry “Fine,” if “Death,” cry “Death,”   Insisting on the old prerogative   And power i’ th’ truth o’ th’ cause.        AEDILE.   I shall inform them.        BRUTUS.   And when such time they have begun to cry,   Let them not cease, but with a din confused   Enforce the present execution   Of what we chance to sentence.        AEDILE.   Very well.        SICINIUS.   Make them be strong and ready for this hint   When we shall hap to give’t them.        BRUTUS.   Go about it.      [ Exit  Aedile . ]      Put him to choler straight. He hath been used   Ever to conquer and to have his worth   Of contradiction. Being once chafed, he cannot   Be reined again to temperance; then he speaks   What’s in his heart; and that is there which looks   With us to break his neck.        Enter  Coriolanus, Menenius  and   Cominius  with other Senators.        SICINIUS.   Well, here he comes.        MENENIUS.   Calmly, I do beseech you.        CORIOLANUS.   Ay, as an ostler, that for th’ poorest piece   Will bear the knave by th’ volume.—Th’ honoured gods   Keep Rome in safety and the chairs of justice   Supplied with worthy men! Plant love among’s!   Throng our large temples with the shows of peace   And not our streets with war!        FIRST SENATOR.   Amen, amen.        MENENIUS.   A noble wish.        Enter the  Aedile  with the Plebeians.        SICINIUS.   Draw near, ye people.        AEDILE.   List to your tribunes. Audience! Peace, I say!        CORIOLANUS.   First, hear me speak.        BOTH TRIBUNES.   Well, say.—Peace, ho!        CORIOLANUS.   Shall I be charged no further than this present?   Must all determine here?        SICINIUS.   I do demand   If you submit you to the people’s voices,   Allow their officers, and are content   To suffer lawful censure for such faults   As shall be proved upon you.        CORIOLANUS.   I am content.        MENENIUS.   Lo, citizens, he says he is content.   The warlike service he has done, consider. Think   Upon the wounds his body bears, which show   Like graves i’ th’ holy churchyard.        CORIOLANUS.   Scratches with briars,   Scars to move laughter only.        MENENIUS.   Consider further,   That when he speaks not like a citizen,   You find him like a soldier. Do not take   His rougher accents for malicious sounds,   But, as I say, such as become a soldier   Rather than envy you.        COMINIUS.   Well, well, no more.        CORIOLANUS.   What is the matter,   That, being passed for consul with full voice,   I am so dishonoured that the very hour   You take it off again?        SICINIUS.   Answer to us.        CORIOLANUS.   Say then. ’Tis true, I ought so.        SICINIUS.   We charge you that you have contrived to take   From Rome all seasoned office and to wind   Yourself into a power tyrannical,   For which you are a traitor to the people.        CORIOLANUS.   How? Traitor?        MENENIUS.   Nay, temperately! Your promise.        CORIOLANUS.   The fires i’ th’ lowest hell fold in the people!   Call me their traitor? Thou injurious tribune!   Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,   In thy hands clutched as many millions, in   Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say   “Thou liest” unto thee with a voice as free   As I do pray the gods.        SICINIUS.   Mark you this, people?        ALL PLEBEIANS.   To th’ rock, to th’ rock with him!        SICINIUS.   Peace!   We need not put new matter to his charge.   What you have seen him do and heard him speak,   Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,   Opposing laws with strokes, and here defying   Those whose great power must try him—even this,   So criminal and in such capital kind,   Deserves th’ extremest death.        BRUTUS.   But since he hath   Served well for Rome—        CORIOLANUS.   What do you prate of service?        BRUTUS.   I talk of that that know it.        CORIOLANUS.   You?        MENENIUS.   Is this the promise that you made your mother?        COMINIUS.   Know, I pray you—        CORIOLANUS.   I’ll know no further.   Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,   Vagabond exile, flaying, pent to linger   But with a grain a day, I would not buy   Their mercy at the price of one fair word,   Nor check my courage for what they can give,   To have’t with saying “Good morrow.”        SICINIUS.   For that he has,   As much as in him lies, from time to time   Envied against the people, seeking means   To pluck away their power, as now at last   Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence   Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers   That do distribute it, in the name o’ th’ people   And in the power of us the Tribunes, we,   Even from this instant, banish him our city   In peril of precipitation   From off the rock Tarpeian, never more   To enter our Rome gates. I’ th’ people’s name,   I say it shall be so.        ALL PLEBEIANS.   It shall be so, it shall be so! Let him away!   He’s banished, and it shall be so.        COMINIUS.   Hear me, my masters and my common friends—        SICINIUS.   He’s sentenced. No more hearing.        COMINIUS.   Let me speak.   I have been consul and can show for Rome   Her enemies’ marks upon me. I do love   My country’s good with a respect more tender,   More holy and profound, than mine own life,   My dear wife’s estimate, her womb’s increase,   And treasure of my loins. Then if I would   Speak that—        SICINIUS.   We know your drift. Speak what?        BRUTUS.   There’s no more to be said, but he is banished   As enemy to the people and his country.   It shall be so.        ALL PLEBEIANS.   It shall be so, it shall be so!        CORIOLANUS.   You common cry of curs, whose breath I hate   As reek o’ th’ rotten fens, whose loves I prize   As the dead carcasses of unburied men   That do corrupt my air, I banish you!   And here remain with your uncertainty;   Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts;   Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,   Fan you into despair! Have the power still   To banish your defenders, till at length   Your ignorance—which finds not till it feels,   Making but reservation of yourselves,   Still your own foes—deliver you,   As most abated captives to some nation   That won you without blows! Despising   For you the city, thus I turn my back.   There is a world elsewhere.      [ Exeunt  Coriolanus, Cominius,   with other Senators. ]      AEDILE.   The people’s enemy is gone, is gone.        ALL PLEBEIANS.   Our enemy is banished; he is gone. Hoo, hoo!      [ They all shout and throw up their caps. ]      SICINIUS.   Go see him out at gates, and follow him,   As he hath followed you, with all despite.   Give him deserved vexation. Let a guard   Attend us through the city.        ALL PLEBEIANS.   Come, come, let’s see him out at gates! Come!   The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come.      [ Exeunt. ]               ACT IV       SCENE I. Rome. Before a gate of the city       Enter  Coriolanus, Volumnia, Virgilia, Menenius,  Cominius  with the young nobility of Rome.        CORIOLANUS.   Come, leave your tears. A brief farewell. The beast   With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,   Where is your ancient courage? You were used   To say extremities was the trier of spirits;   That common chances common men could bear;   That when the sea was calm, all boats alike   Showed mastership in floating; fortune’s blows   When most struck home, being gentle wounded craves   A noble cunning. You were used to load me   With precepts that would make invincible   The heart that conned them.        VIRGILIA.   O heavens! O heavens!        CORIOLANUS.   Nay, I prithee, woman—        VOLUMNIA.   Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,   And occupations perish!        CORIOLANUS.   What, what, what!   I shall be loved when I am lacked. Nay, mother,   Resume that spirit when you were wont to say   If you had been the wife of Hercules,   Six of his labours you’d have done and saved   Your husband so much sweat.—Cominius,   Droop not. Adieu.—Farewell, my wife, my mother.   I’ll do well yet.—Thou old and true Menenius,   Thy tears are salter than a younger man’s   And venomous to thine eyes.—My sometime general,   I have seen thee stern, and thou hast oft beheld   Heart-hard’ning spectacles. Tell these sad women   ’Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes   As ’tis to laugh at ’em.—My mother, you wot well   My hazards still have been your solace, and—   Believe’t not lightly—though I go alone,   Like to a lonely dragon that his fen   Makes feared and talked of more than seen, your son   Will or exceed the common or be caught   With cautelous baits and practice.        VOLUMNIA.   My first son,   Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius   With thee awhile. Determine on some course   More than a wild exposture to each chance   That starts i’ th’ way before thee.        VIRGILIA.   O the gods!        COMINIUS.   I’ll follow thee a month, devise with thee   Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us   And we of thee; so if the time thrust forth   A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send   O’er the vast world to seek a single man   And lose advantage, which doth ever cool   I’ th’ absence of the needer.        CORIOLANUS.   Fare ye well.   Thou hast years upon thee, and thou art too full   Of the wars’ surfeits to go rove with one   That’s yet unbruised. Bring me but out at gate.—   Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and   My friends of noble touch. When I am forth,   Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.   While I remain above the ground, you shall   Hear from me still, and never of me aught   But what is like me formerly.        MENENIUS.   That’s worthily   As any ear can hear. Come, let’s not weep.   If I could shake off but one seven years   From these old arms and legs, by the good gods,   I’d with thee every foot.        CORIOLANUS.   Give me thy hand.   Come.      [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE II. Rome. A street near the gate       Enter two Tribunes,  Sicinius, Brutus  with the   Aedile .        SICINIUS.   Bid them all home. He’s gone, and we’ll no further.   The nobility are vexed, whom we see have sided   In his behalf.        BRUTUS.   Now we have shown our power,   Let us seem humbler after it is done   Than when it was a-doing.        SICINIUS.   Bid them home.   Say their great enemy is gone, and they   Stand in their ancient strength.        BRUTUS.   Dismiss them home.      [ Exit  Aedile . ]      Here comes his mother.        Enter  Volumnia, Virgilia  and   Menenius .        SICINIUS.   Let’s not meet her.        BRUTUS.   Why?        SICINIUS.   They say she’s mad.        BRUTUS.   They have ta’en note of us. Keep on your way.        VOLUMNIA.   O, you’re well met. The hoarded plague o’ th’ gods   Requite your love!        MENENIUS.   Peace, peace! Be not so loud.        VOLUMNIA.   If that I could for weeping, you should hear—   Nay, and you shall hear some. [ To Sicinius .] Will you be gone?        VIRGILIA.   [ To Brutus .] You shall stay too. I would I had the power   To say so to my husband.        SICINIUS.   Are you mankind?        VOLUMNIA.   Ay, fool, is that a shame? Note but this, fool.   Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship   To banish him that struck more blows for Rome   Than thou hast spoken words?        SICINIUS.   O blessed heavens!        VOLUMNIA.   More noble blows than ever thou wise words,   And for Rome’s good. I’ll tell thee what—yet go.   Nay, but thou shalt stay too. I would my son   Were in Arabia and thy tribe before him,   His good sword in his hand.        SICINIUS.   What then?        VIRGILIA.   What then?   He’d make an end of thy posterity.        VOLUMNIA.   Bastards and all.   Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!        MENENIUS.   Come, come, peace.        SICINIUS.   I would he had continued to his country   As he began, and not unknit himself   The noble knot he made.        BRUTUS.   I would he had.        VOLUMNIA.   “I would he had?” ’Twas you incensed the rabble.   Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth   As I can of those mysteries which heaven   Will not have Earth to know.        BRUTUS.   Pray, let’s go.        VOLUMNIA.   Now, pray, sir, get you gone.   You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:   As far as doth the Capitol exceed   The meanest house in Rome, so far my son—   This lady’s husband here, this, do you see?—   Whom you have banished, does exceed you all.        BRUTUS.   Well, well, we’ll leave you.        SICINIUS.   Why stay we to be baited   With one that wants her wits?      [ Exeunt  Tribunes . ]      VOLUMNIA.   Take my prayers with you.   I would the gods had nothing else to do   But to confirm my curses. Could I meet ’em   But once a day, it would unclog my heart   Of what lies heavy to’t.        MENENIUS.   You have told them home,   And, by my troth, you have cause. You’ll sup with me?        VOLUMNIA.   Anger’s my meat. I sup upon myself   And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let’s go.   Leave this faint puling, and lament as I do,   In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.      [ Exeunt. ]      MENENIUS.   Fie, fie, fie!      [ Exit  Menenius . ]        SCENE III. A highway between Rome and Antium       Enter a  Roman  and a   Volsce .        ROMAN.   I know you well, sir, and you know me. Your name I think is Adrian.        VOLSCE.   It is so, sir. Truly, I have forgot you.        ROMAN.   I am a Roman, and my services are, as you are, against ’em. Know you me yet?        VOLSCE.   Nicanor, no?        ROMAN.   The same, sir.        VOLSCE.   You had more beard when I last saw you, but your favour is well approved by  your tongue. What’s the news in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state to  find you out there. You have well saved me a day’s journey.        ROMAN.   There hath been in Rome strange insurrections, the people against the senators,  patricians, and nobles.        VOLSCE.   Hath been? Is it ended, then? Our state thinks not so. They are in a most  warlike preparation and hope to come upon them in the heat of their division.        ROMAN.   The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing would make it flame again; for  the nobles receive so to heart the banishment of that worthy Coriolanus that  they are in a ripe aptness to take all power from the people and to pluck from  them their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can tell you, and is almost  mature for the violent breaking out.        VOLSCE.   Coriolanus banished?        ROMAN.   Banished, sir.        VOLSCE.   You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.        ROMAN.   The day serves well for them now. I have heard it said the fittest time to  corrupt a man’s wife is when she’s fallen out with her husband. Your noble  Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his great opposer Coriolanus  being now in no request of his country.        VOLSCE.   He cannot choose. I am most fortunate thus accidentally to encounter you. You  have ended my business, and I will merrily accompany you home.        ROMAN.   I shall between this and supper tell you most strange things from Rome, all  tending to the good of their adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?        VOLSCE.   A most royal one. The centurions and their charges, distinctly billeted,  already in th’ entertainment, and to be on foot at an hour’s warning.        ROMAN.   I am joyful to hear of their readiness and am the man, I think, that shall set  them in present action. So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your  company.        VOLSCE.   You take my part from me, sir. I have the most cause to be glad of yours.        ROMAN.   Well, let us go together.      [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE IV. Antium. Before Aufidius’s house       Enter  Coriolanus  in mean apparel, disguised and  muffled.        CORIOLANUS.   A goodly city is this Antium. City,   ’Tis I that made thy widows. Many an heir   Of these fair edifices ’fore my wars   Have I heard groan and drop. Then know me not,   Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones   In puny battle slay me.        Enter a  Citizen .        Save you, sir.        CITIZEN.   And you.        CORIOLANUS.   Direct me, if it be your will,   Where great Aufidius lies. Is he in Antium?        CITIZEN.   He is, and feasts the nobles of the state   At his house this night.        CORIOLANUS.   Which is his house, beseech you?        CITIZEN.   This here before you.        CORIOLANUS.   Thank you, sir. Farewell.      [ Exit  Citizen . ]      O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,   Whose double bosoms seems to wear one heart,   Whose hours, whose bed, whose meal and exercise   Are still together, who twin, as ’twere, in love   Unseparable, shall within this hour,   On a dissension of a doit, break out   To bitterest enmity; so fellest foes,   Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep   To take the one the other, by some chance,   Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends   And interjoin their issues. So with me:   My birthplace hate I, and my love’s upon   This enemy town. I’ll enter. If he slay me,   He does fair justice; if he give me way,   I’ll do his country service.      [ Exit. ]        SCENE V. Antium. A hall in Aufidius’s house       Music plays. Enter a  Servingman .        FIRST SERVINGMAN.   Wine, wine, wine! What service is here? I think our fellows are asleep.      [ Exit. ]      Enter another  Servingman .        SECOND SERVINGMAN.   Where’s Cotus? My master calls for him. Cotus!      [ Exit. ]      Enter  Coriolanus .        CORIOLANUS.   A goodly house. The feast smells well, but I   Appear not like a guest.        Enter the First  Servingman .        FIRST SERVINGMAN.   What would you have, friend? Whence are you? Here’s no place for you. Pray go  to the door.      [ Exit. ]      CORIOLANUS.   I have deserved no better entertainment   In being Coriolanus.        Enter Second  Servingman .        SECOND SERVINGMAN.   Whence are you, sir?—Has the porter his eyes in his head, that he gives  entrance to such companions?—Pray, get you out.        CORIOLANUS.   Away!        SECOND SERVINGMAN.   Away? Get you away.        CORIOLANUS.   Now th’ art troublesome.        SECOND SERVINGMAN.   Are you so brave? I’ll have you talked with anon.        Enter Third   Servingman;  the First, entering,  meets him.        THIRD SERVINGMAN.   What fellow’s this?        FIRST SERVINGMAN.   A strange one as ever I looked on. I cannot get him out o’ th’ house. Prithee  call my master to him.        THIRD SERVINGMAN.   What have you to do here, fellow? Pray you, avoid the house.        CORIOLANUS.   Let me but stand. I will not hurt your hearth.        THIRD SERVINGMAN.   What are you?        CORIOLANUS.   A gentleman.        THIRD SERVINGMAN.   A marv’llous poor one.        CORIOLANUS.   True, so I am.        THIRD SERVINGMAN.   Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some other station. Here’s no place for you.  Pray you, avoid. Come.        CORIOLANUS.   Follow your function, go, and batten on cold bits.      [ Pushes him away from him .]      THIRD SERVINGMAN.   What, you will not?—Prithee, tell my master what a strange guest he has here.        SECOND SERVINGMAN.   And I shall.      [ Exit. ]      THIRD SERVINGMAN.   Where dwell’st thou?        CORIOLANUS.   Under the canopy.        THIRD SERVINGMAN.   Under the canopy?        CORIOLANUS.   Ay.        THIRD SERVINGMAN.   Where’s that?        CORIOLANUS.   I’ th’ city of kites and crows.        THIRD SERVINGMAN.   I’ th’ city of kites and crows? What an ass it is! Then thou dwell’st with daws  too?        CORIOLANUS.   No, I serve not thy master.        THIRD SERVINGMAN.   How, sir? Do you meddle with my master?        CORIOLANUS.   Ay, ’tis an honester service than to meddle with thy mistress. Thou prat’st and  prat’st. Serve with thy trencher, hence!      [ Beats him away .]    [ Exit  Third Servingman . ]      Enter  Aufidius  with the Second   Servingman .        AUFIDIUS.   Where is this fellow?        SECOND SERVINGMAN.   Here, sir. I’d have beaten him like a dog, but for disturbing the lords within.        AUFIDIUS.   Whence com’st thou? What wouldst thou?   Thy name? Why speak’st not? Speak, man. What’s thy name?        CORIOLANUS.   [ Removing his muffler .] If, Tullus,   Not yet thou know’st me, and, seeing me, dost not   Think me for the man I am, necessity   Commands me name myself.        AUFIDIUS.   What is thy name?        CORIOLANUS.   A name unmusical to the Volscians’ ears   And harsh in sound to thine.        AUFIDIUS.   Say, what’s thy name?   Thou has a grim appearance, and thy face   Bears a command in’t. Though thy tackle’s torn,   Thou show’st a noble vessel. What’s thy name?        CORIOLANUS.   Prepare thy brow to frown. Know’st thou me yet?        AUFIDIUS.   I know thee not. Thy name?        CORIOLANUS.   My name is Caius Martius, who hath done   To thee particularly and to all the Volsces   Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may   My surname Coriolanus. The painful service,   The extreme dangers, and the drops of blood   Shed for my thankless country are requited   But with that surname, a good memory   And witness of the malice and displeasure   Which thou shouldst bear me. Only that name remains.   The cruelty and envy of the people,   Permitted by our dastard nobles, who   Have all forsook me, hath devoured the rest,   And suffered me by th’ voice of slaves to be   Whooped out of Rome. Now this extremity   Hath brought me to thy hearth, not out of hope—   Mistake me not—to save my life; for if   I had feared death, of all the men i’ th’ world   I would have ’voided thee, but in mere spite,   To be full quit of those my banishers,   Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast   A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge   Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims   Of shame seen through thy country, speed thee straight   And make my misery serve thy turn. So use it   That my revengeful services may prove   As benefits to thee, for I will fight   Against my cankered country with the spleen   Of all the under fiends. But if so be   Thou dar’st not this, and that to prove more fortunes   Thou ’rt tired, then, in a word, I also am   Longer to live most weary, and present   My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice,   Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,   Since I have ever followed thee with hate,   Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country’s breast,   And cannot live but to thy shame, unless   It be to do thee service.        AUFIDIUS.   O Martius, Martius,   Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart   A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter   Should from yond cloud speak divine things   And say ’tis true, I’d not believe them more   Than thee, all-noble Martius. Let me twine   Mine arms about that body, whereagainst   My grained ash an hundred times hath broke   And scarred the moon with splinters. Here I clip   The anvil of my sword and do contest   As hotly and as nobly with thy love   As ever in ambitious strength I did   Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,   I loved the maid I married; never man   Sighed truer breath. But that I see thee here,   Thou noble thing, more dances my rapt heart   Than when I first my wedded mistress saw   Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars, I tell thee   We have a power on foot, and I had purpose   Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn   Or lose mine arm for’t. Thou hast beat me out   Twelve several times, and I have nightly since   Dreamt of encounters ’twixt thyself and me;   We have been down together in my sleep,   Unbuckling helms, fisting each other’s throat,   And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Martius,   Had we no other quarrel else to Rome but that   Thou art thence banished, we would muster all   From twelve to seventy and, pouring war   Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,   Like a bold flood o’erbear ’t. O, come, go in,   And take our friendly senators by th’ hands,   Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,   Who am prepared against your territories,   Though not for Rome itself.        CORIOLANUS.   You bless me, gods!        AUFIDIUS.   Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have   The leading of thine own revenges, take   Th’ one half of my commission and set down—   As best thou art experienced, since thou know’st   Thy country’s strength and weakness—thine own ways,   Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,   Or rudely visit them in parts remote   To fright them ere destroy. But come in.   Let me commend thee first to those that shall   Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!   And more a friend than e’er an enemy—   Yet, Martius, that was much. Your hand. Most welcome!        [ Exeunt  Coriolanus  and   Aufidius . ]        Two of the  Servingmen  come forward.        FIRST SERVINGMAN.   Here’s a strange alteration!        SECOND SERVINGMAN.   By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with a cudgel, and yet my mind  gave me his clothes made a false report of him.        FIRST SERVINGMAN.   What an arm he has! He turned me about with his finger and his thumb as one  would set up a top.        SECOND SERVINGMAN.   Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in him. He had, sir, a kind of  face, methought—I cannot tell how to term it.        FIRST SERVINGMAN.   He had so, looking as it were—Would I were hanged, but I thought there was  more in him than I could think.        SECOND SERVINGMAN.   So did I, I’ll be sworn. He is simply the rarest man i’ th’ world.        FIRST SERVINGMAN.   I think he is. But a greater soldier than he you wot one.        SECOND SERVINGMAN.   Who, my master?        FIRST SERVINGMAN.   Nay, it’s no matter for that.        SECOND SERVINGMAN.   Worth six on him.        FIRST SERVINGMAN.   Nay, not so neither. But I take him to be the greater soldier.        SECOND SERVINGMAN.   Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that. For the defence of a town our  general is excellent.        FIRST SERVINGMAN.   Ay, and for an assault too.        Enter the Third  Servingman .        THIRD SERVINGMAN.   O slaves, I can tell you news, news, you rascals!        FIRST and SECOND SERVINGMAN.   What, what, what? Let’s partake.        THIRD SERVINGMAN.   I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as lief be a condemned man.        FIRST and SECOND SERVINGMAN.   Wherefore? Wherefore?        THIRD SERVINGMAN.   Why, here’s he that was wont to thwack our general, Caius Martius.        FIRST SERVINGMAN.   Why do you say, “thwack our general”?        THIRD SERVINGMAN.   I do not say “thwack our general,” but he was always good enough for him.        SECOND SERVINGMAN.   Come, we are fellows and friends. He was ever too hard for him; I have heard  him say so himself.        FIRST SERVINGMAN.   He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth on’t, before Corioles; he  scotched him and notched him like a carbonado.        SECOND SERVINGMAN.   An he had been cannibally given, he might have boiled and eaten him too.        FIRST SERVINGMAN.   But, more of thy news?        THIRD SERVINGMAN.   Why, he is so made on here within as if he were son and heir to Mars; set at  upper end o’ th’ table; no question asked him by any of the senators but they  stand bald before him. Our general himself makes a mistress of him, sanctifies  himself with’s hand, and turns up the white o’ th’ eye to his discourse. But  the bottom of the news is, our general is cut i’ th’ middle and but one half  of what he was yesterday, for the other has half, by the entreaty and grant of  the whole table. He’ll go, he says, and sowl the porter of Rome gates by th’  ears. He will mow all down before him and leave his passage polled.        SECOND SERVINGMAN.   And he’s as like to do’t as any man I can imagine.        THIRD SERVINGMAN.   Do’t? He will do’t! For look you, sir, he has as many friends as enemies, which  friends, sir, as it were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as we term  it, his friends whilest he’s in directitude.        FIRST SERVINGMAN.   Directitude? What’s that?        THIRD SERVINGMAN.   But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again, and the man in blood, they  will out of their burrows like coneys after rain, and revel all with him.        FIRST SERVINGMAN.   But when goes this forward?        THIRD SERVINGMAN.   Tomorrow, today, presently. You shall have the drum struck up this afternoon.  ’Tis as it were parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they wipe their  lips.        SECOND SERVINGMAN.   Why then, we shall have a stirring world again. This peace is nothing but to  rust iron, increase tailors, and breed ballad-makers.        FIRST SERVINGMAN.   Let me have war, say I. It exceeds peace as far as day does night. It’s  sprightly walking, audible, and full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy,  lethargy; mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more bastard children  than war’s a destroyer of men.        SECOND SERVINGMAN.   ’Tis so, and as war in some sort, may be said to be a ravisher, so it cannot be  denied but peace is a great maker of cuckolds.        FIRST SERVINGMAN.   Ay, and it makes men hate one another.        THIRD SERVINGMAN.   Reason: because they then less need one another. The wars for my money! I hope  to see Romans as cheap as Volscians. They are rising; they are rising.        ALL.   In, in, in, in!      [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE VI. Rome. A public place       Enter the two Tribunes.  Sicinius  and   Brutus .        SICINIUS.   We hear not of him, neither need we fear him.   His remedies are tame—the present peace,   And quietness of the people, which before   Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends   Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,   Though they themselves did suffer by’t, behold   Dissentious numbers pest’ring streets than see   Our tradesmen singing in their shops and going   About their functions friendly.        BRUTUS.   We stood to’t in good time.        Enter  Menenius .        Is this Menenius?        SICINIUS.   ’Tis he, ’tis he. O, he is grown most kind   Of late.—Hail, sir!        MENENIUS.   Hail to you both.        SICINIUS.   Your Coriolanus is not much missed   But with his friends. The commonwealth doth stand,   And so would do were he more angry at it.        MENENIUS.   All’s well, and might have been much better if   He could have temporized.        SICINIUS.   Where is he, hear you?        MENENIUS.   Nay, I hear nothing;   His mother and his wife hear nothing from him.        Enter three or four  Citizens .        ALL CITIZENS.   The gods preserve you both!        SICINIUS.   Good e’en, our neighbours.        BRUTUS.   Good e’en to you all, good e’en to you all.        FIRST CITIZEN.   Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees   Are bound to pray for you both.        SICINIUS.   Live and thrive!        BRUTUS.   Farewell, kind neighbours. We wished Coriolanus   Had loved you as we did.        CITIZENS.   Now the gods keep you!        BOTH TRIBUNES.   Farewell, farewell.      [ Exeunt  Citizens . ]      SICINIUS.   This is a happier and more comely time   Than when these fellows ran about the streets   Crying confusion.        BRUTUS.   Caius Martius was   A worthy officer i’ th’ war, but insolent,   O’ercome with pride, ambitious, past all thinking   Self-loving.        SICINIUS.   And affecting one sole throne, without assistance.        MENENIUS.   I think not so.        SICINIUS.   We should by this, to all our lamentation,   If he had gone forth consul, found it so.        BRUTUS.   The gods have well prevented it, and Rome   Sits safe and still without him.        Enter an  Aedile .        AEDILE.   Worthy tribunes,   There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,   Reports the Volsces with two several powers   Are entered in the Roman territories,   And with the deepest malice of the war   Destroy what lies before ’em.        MENENIUS.   ’Tis Aufidius,   Who, hearing of our Martius’ banishment,   Thrusts forth his horns again into the world,   Which were inshelled when Martius stood for Rome,   And durst not once peep out.        SICINIUS.   Come, what talk you of Martius?        BRUTUS.   Go see this rumourer whipped. It cannot be   The Volsces dare break with us.        MENENIUS.   Cannot be?   We have record that very well it can,   And three examples of the like hath been   Within my age. But reason with the fellow   Before you punish him, where he heard this,   Lest you shall chance to whip your information   And beat the messenger who bids beware   Of what is to be dreaded.        SICINIUS.   Tell not me.   I know this cannot be.        BRUTUS.   Not possible.        Enter a  Messenger .        MESSENGER.   The nobles in great earnestness are going   All to the Senate House. Some news is coming   That turns their countenances.        SICINIUS.   ’Tis this slave—   Go whip him ’fore the people’s eyes—his raising,   Nothing but his report.        MESSENGER.   Yes, worthy sir,   The slave’s report is seconded, and more,   More fearful, is delivered.        SICINIUS.   What more fearful?        MESSENGER.   It is spoke freely out of many mouths—   How probable I do not know—that Martius,   Joined with Aufidius, leads a power ’gainst Rome   And vows revenge as spacious as between   The young’st and oldest thing.        SICINIUS.   This is most likely!        BRUTUS.   Raised only that the weaker sort may wish   Good Martius home again.        SICINIUS.   The very trick on ’t.        MENENIUS.   This is unlikely;   He and Aufidius can no more atone   Than violent’st contrariety.        Enter a Second  Messenger .        SECOND MESSENGER.   You are sent for to the Senate.   A fearful army, led by Caius Martius   Associated with Aufidius, rages   Upon our territories, and have already   O’erborne their way, consumed with fire and took   What lay before them.        Enter  Cominius .        COMINIUS.   O, you have made good work!        MENENIUS.   What news? What news?        COMINIUS.   You have holp to ravish your own daughters and   To melt the city leads upon your pates,   To see your wives dishonoured to your noses—        MENENIUS.   What’s the news? What’s the news?        COMINIUS.   Your temples burned in their cement, and   Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined   Into an auger’s bore.        MENENIUS.   Pray now, your news?—   You have made fair work, I fear me.—Pray, your news?   If Martius should be joined with Volscians—        COMINIUS.   If?   He is their god; he leads them like a thing   Made by some other deity than Nature,   That shapes man better; and they follow him   Against us brats with no less confidence   Than boys pursuing summer butterflies   Or butchers killing flies.        MENENIUS.   You have made good work,   You and your apron-men, you that stood so much   Upon the voice of occupation and   The breath of garlic eaters!        COMINIUS.   He’ll shake your Rome about your ears.        MENENIUS.   As Hercules did shake down mellow fruit.   You have made fair work.        BRUTUS.   But is this true, sir?        COMINIUS.   Ay, and you’ll look pale   Before you find it other. All the regions   Do smilingly revolt, and who resists   Are mocked for valiant ignorance   And perish constant fools. Who is’t can blame him?   Your enemies and his find something in him.        MENENIUS.   We are all undone unless   The noble man have mercy.        COMINIUS.   Who shall ask it?   The Tribunes cannot do’t for shame; the people   Deserve such pity of him as the wolf   Does of the shepherds. For his best friends, if they   Should say “Be good to Rome,” they charged him even   As those should do that had deserved his hate   And therein showed like enemies.        MENENIUS.   ’Tis true.   If he were putting to my house the brand   That should consume it, I have not the face   To say “Beseech you, cease.”—You have made fair hands,   You and your crafts! You have crafted fair!        COMINIUS.   You have brought   A trembling upon Rome such as was never   S’ incapable of help.        TRIBUNES.   Say not we brought it.        MENENIUS.   How? Was it we? We loved him, but like beasts   And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,   Who did hoot him out o’ th’ city.        COMINIUS.   But I fear   They’ll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,   The second name of men, obeys his points   As if he were his officer. Desperation   Is all the policy, strength, and defence   That Rome can make against them.        Enter a troop of  Citizens .        MENENIUS.   Here comes the clusters.—   And is Aufidius with him? You are they   That made the air unwholesome when you cast   Your stinking, greasy caps in hooting at   Coriolanus’ exile. Now he’s coming,   And not a hair upon a soldier’s head   Which will not prove a whip. As many coxcombs   As you threw caps up will he tumble down   And pay you for your voices. ’Tis no matter.   If he could burn us all into one coal   We have deserved it.        ALL CITIZENS.   Faith, we hear fearful news.        FIRST CITIZEN.   For mine own part,   When I said banish him, I said ’twas pity.        SECOND CITIZEN.   And so did I.        THIRD CITIZEN.   And so did I. And, to say the truth, so did very many of us. That we did we  did for the best; and though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet it  was against our will.        COMINIUS.   You are goodly things, you voices!        MENENIUS.   You have made good work, you and your cry!—   Shall’s to the Capitol?        COMINIUS.   O, ay, what else?        [ Exeunt  Cominius  and   Menenius . ]        SICINIUS.   Go, masters, get you home. Be not dismayed.   These are a side that would be glad to have   This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,   And show no sign of fear.        FIRST CITIZEN.   The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let’s home. I ever said we were i’ th’  wrong when we banished him.        SECOND CITIZEN.   So did we all. But, come, let’s home.      [ Exeunt  Citizens . ]      BRUTUS.   I do not like this news.        SICINIUS.   Nor I.        BRUTUS.   Let’s to the Capitol. Would half my wealth   Would buy this for a lie!        SICINIUS.   Pray let’s go.      [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE VII. A camp at a short distance from Rome       Enter  Aufidius  with his   Lieutenant .        AUFIDIUS.   Do they still fly to th’ Roman?        LIEUTENANT.   I do not know what witchcraft’s in him, but   Your soldiers use him as the grace ’fore meat,   Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;   And you are dark’ned in this action, sir,   Even by your own.        AUFIDIUS.   I cannot help it now,   Unless by using means I lame the foot   Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,   Even to my person, than I thought he would   When first I did embrace him. Yet his nature   In that’s no changeling, and I must excuse   What cannot be amended.        LIEUTENANT.   Yet I wish, sir—   I mean for your particular—you had not   Joined in commission with him, but either   Had borne the action of yourself or else   To him had left it solely.        AUFIDIUS.   I understand thee well, and be thou sure,   When he shall come to his account, he knows not   What I can urge against him, although it seems,   And so he thinks and is no less apparent   To th’ vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly,   And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,   Fights dragonlike, and does achieve as soon   As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone   That which shall break his neck or hazard mine   Whene’er we come to our account.        LIEUTENANT.   Sir, I beseech you, think you he’ll carry Rome?        AUFIDIUS.   All places yield to him ere he sits down,   And the nobility of Rome are his;   The Senators and Patricians love him too.   The Tribunes are no soldiers, and their people   Will be as rash in the repeal as hasty   To expel him thence. I think he’ll be to Rome   As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it   By sovereignty of nature. First, he was   A noble servant to them, but he could not   Carry his honours even. Whether ’twas pride,   Which out of daily fortune ever taints   The happy man; whether defect of judgment,   To fail in the disposing of those chances   Which he was lord of; or whether nature,   Not to be other than one thing, not moving   From th’ casque to th’ cushion, but commanding peace   Even with the same austerity and garb   As he controlled the war; but one of these—   As he hath spices of them all—not all,   For I dare so far free him—made him feared,   So hated, and so banished. But he has a merit   To choke it in the utt’rance. So our virtues   Lie in th’ interpretation of the time,   And power, unto itself most commendable,   Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair   T’ extol what it hath done.   One fire drives out one fire, one nail one nail;   Rights by rights falter; strengths by strengths do fail.   Come, let’s away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,   Thou art poor’st of all; then shortly art thou mine.      [ Exeunt. ]               ACT V       SCENE I. Rome. A public place       Enter  Menenius, Cominius, Sicinius, Brutus  (the  two Tribunes), with others.        MENENIUS.   No, I’ll not go. You hear what he hath said   Which was sometime his general, who loved him   In a most dear particular. He called me father,   But what o’ that? Go you that banished him;   A mile before his tent, fall down, and knee   The way into his mercy. Nay, if he coyed   To hear Cominius speak, I’ll keep at home.        COMINIUS.   He would not seem to know me.        MENENIUS.   Do you hear?        COMINIUS.   Yet one time he did call me by my name.   I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops   That we have bled together. “Coriolanus”   He would not answer to, forbade all names.   He was a kind of nothing, titleless,   Till he had forged himself a name i’ th’ fire   Of burning Rome.        MENENIUS.   Why, so; you have made good work!   A pair of tribunes that have wracked Rome   To make coals cheap! A noble memory!        COMINIUS.   I minded him how royal ’twas to pardon   When it was less expected. He replied   It was a bare petition of a state   To one whom they had punished.        MENENIUS.   Very well.   Could he say less?        COMINIUS.   I offered to awaken his regard   For’s private friends. His answer to me was   He could not stay to pick them in a pile   Of noisome musty chaff. He said ’twas folly   For one poor grain or two to leave unburnt   And still to nose th’ offence.        MENENIUS.   For one poor grain or two!   I am one of those! His mother, wife, his child,   And this brave fellow too, we are the grains;   You are the musty chaff, and you are smelt   Above the moon. We must be burnt for you.        SICINIUS.   Nay, pray, be patient. If you refuse your aid   In this so-never-needed help, yet do not   Upbraid’s with our distress. But sure, if you   Would be your country’s pleader, your good tongue,   More than the instant army we can make,   Might stop our countryman.        MENENIUS.   No, I’ll not meddle.        SICINIUS.   Pray you, go to him.        MENENIUS.   What should I do?        BRUTUS.   Only make trial what your love can do   For Rome, towards Martius.        MENENIUS.   Well, and say that Martius   Return me, as Cominius is returned, unheard,   What then? But as a discontented friend,   Grief-shot with his unkindness? Say’t be so?        SICINIUS.   Yet your good will   Must have that thanks from Rome after the measure   As you intended well.        MENENIUS.   I’ll undertake’t.   I think he’ll hear me. Yet to bite his lip   And hum at good Cominius much unhearts me.   He was not taken well; he had not dined.   The veins unfilled, our blood is cold, and then   We pout upon the morning, are unapt   To give or to forgive; but when we have stuffed   These pipes and these conveyances of our blood   With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls   Than in our priestlike fasts. Therefore I’ll watch him   Till he be dieted to my request,   And then I’ll set upon him.        BRUTUS.   You know the very road into his kindness   And cannot lose your way.        MENENIUS.   Good faith, I’ll prove him,   Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge   Of my success.      [ Exit. ]      COMINIUS.   He’ll never hear him.        SICINIUS.   Not?        COMINIUS.   I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye   Red as ’twould burn Rome; and his injury   The jailer to his pity. I kneeled before him;   ’Twas very faintly he said “Rise”; dismissed me   Thus with his speechless hand. What he would do   He sent in writing after me; what he   Would not, bound with an oath to yield to his   Conditions. So that all hope is vain   Unless his noble mother and his wife,   Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him   For mercy to his country. Therefore let’s hence   And with our fair entreaties haste them on.      [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE II. An Advanced post of the Volscian camp before Rome.       Enter  Menenius  to the Watch, or Guard.        FIRST WATCH.   Stay! Whence are you?        SECOND WATCH.   Stand, and go back.        MENENIUS.   You guard like men; ’tis well. But by your leave,   I am an officer of state and come   To speak with Coriolanus.        FIRST WATCH.   From whence?        MENENIUS.   From Rome.        FIRST WATCH.   You may not pass; you must return. Our general   Will no more hear from thence.        SECOND WATCH.   You’ll see your Rome embraced with fire before   You’ll speak with Coriolanus.        MENENIUS.   Good my friends,   If you have heard your general talk of Rome   And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks   My name hath touched your ears. It is Menenius.        FIRST WATCH.   Be it so; go back. The virtue of your name   Is not here passable.        MENENIUS.   I tell thee, fellow,   Thy general is my lover. I have been   The book of his good acts, whence men have read   His fame unparalleled happily amplified;   For I have ever verified my friends—   Of whom he’s chief—with all the size that verity   Would without lapsing suffer. Nay, sometimes,   Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,   I have tumbled past the throw, and in his praise   Have almost stamped the leasing. Therefore, fellow,   I must have leave to pass.        FIRST WATCH.   Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his behalf as you have uttered  words in your own, you should not pass here, no, though it were as virtuous to  lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.        MENENIUS.   Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius, always factionary on the party  of your general.        SECOND WATCH.   Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you have, I am one that, telling  true under him, must say you cannot pass. Therefore go back.        MENENIUS.   Has he dined, can’st thou tell? For I would not speak with him till after  dinner.        FIRST WATCH.   You are a Roman, are you?        MENENIUS.   I am, as thy general is.        FIRST WATCH.   Then you should hate Rome as he does. Can you, when you have pushed out your  gates the very defender of them, and, in a violent popular ignorance given your  enemy your shield, think to front his revenges with the easy groans of old  women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with the palsied intercession  of such a decayed dotant as you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the  intended fire your city is ready to flame in with such weak breath as this?  No, you are deceived. Therefore back to Rome and prepare for your execution.  You are condemned. Our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon.        MENENIUS.   Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would use me with estimation.        SECOND WATCH.   Come, my captain knows you not.        MENENIUS.   I mean thy general.        FIRST WATCH.   My general cares not for you. Back, I say, go, lest I let forth your half pint  of blood. Back! That’s the utmost of your having. Back!        MENENIUS.   Nay, but fellow, fellow—        Enter  Coriolanus  with   Aufidius .        CORIOLANUS.   What’s the matter?        MENENIUS.   Now, you companion, I’ll say an errand for you. You shall know now that I am in  estimation; you shall perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from my  son Coriolanus. Guess but by my entertainment with him if thou stand’st not i’  th’ state of hanging or of some death more long in spectatorship and crueller  in suffering; behold now presently, and swoon for what’s to come upon thee.  [ to Coriolanus .] The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy  particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old father Menenius  does! O my son, my son! Thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here’s water  to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to thee; but being assured none but  myself could move thee, I have been blown out of your gates with sighs, and  conjure thee to pardon Rome and thy petitionary countrymen. The good gods  assuage thy wrath and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here, this, who,  like a block, hath denied my access to thee.        CORIOLANUS.   Away!        MENENIUS.   How? Away?        CORIOLANUS.   Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs   Are servanted to others. Though I owe   My revenge properly, my remission lies   In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,   Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather   Than pity note how much. Therefore begone.   Mine ears against your suits are stronger than   Your gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,   Take this along; I writ it for thy sake,      [ He gives  Menenius  a paper. ]      And would have sent it. Another word, Menenius,   I will not hear thee speak.—This man, Aufidius,   Was my beloved in Rome; yet thou behold’st.        AUFIDIUS.   You keep a constant temper.      [ They exit. ]      [ The  Guard  and   Menenius  remain. ]        FIRST WATCH.   Now, sir, is your name Menenius?        SECOND WATCH.   ’Tis a spell, you see, of much power. You know the way home again.        FIRST WATCH.   Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your Greatness back?        SECOND WATCH.   What cause do you think I have to swoon?        MENENIUS.   I neither care for th’ world nor your general. For such things as you, I can  scarce think there’s any, you’re so slight. He that hath a will to die by  himself fears it not from another. Let your general do his worst. For you, be  that you are, long; and your misery increase with your age! I say to you, as I  was said to, away!      [ Exit. ]      FIRST WATCH.   A noble fellow, I warrant him.        SECOND WATCH.   The worthy fellow is our general. He is the rock, the oak not to be  wind-shaken.      [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE III. The tent of Coriolanus       Enter  Coriolanus  and   Aufidius .        CORIOLANUS.   We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow   Set down our host. My partner in this action,   You must report to th’ Volscian lords how plainly   I have borne this business.        AUFIDIUS.   Only their ends   You have respected, stopped your ears against   The general suit of Rome; never admitted   A private whisper, no, not with such friends   That thought them sure of you.        CORIOLANUS.   This last old man,   Whom with cracked heart I have sent to Rome,   Loved me above the measure of a father,   Nay, godded me indeed. Their latest refuge   Was to send him, for whose old love I have—   Though I showed sourly to him—once more offered   The first conditions, which they did refuse   And cannot now accept, to grace him only   That thought he could do more. A very little   I have yielded to. Fresh embassies and suits,   Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter   Will I lend ear to.      [ Shout within. ]      Ha? What shout is this?   Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow   In the same time ’tis made? I will not.        Enter  Virgilia, Volumnia, Valeria,   young  Martius  with attendants.        My wife comes foremost, then the honoured mold   Wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand   The grandchild to her blood. But out, affection!   All bond and privilege of nature, break!   Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.   What is that curtsy worth? Or those doves’ eyes,   Which can make gods forsworn? I melt and am not   Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows,   As if Olympus to a molehill should   In supplication nod; and my young boy   Hath an aspect of intercession which   Great Nature cries “Deny not!” Let the Volsces   Plough Rome and harrow Italy, I’ll never   Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand   As if a man were author of himself,   And knew no other kin.        VIRGILIA.   My lord and husband.        CORIOLANUS.   These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.        VIRGILIA.   The sorrow that delivers us thus changed   Makes you think so.        CORIOLANUS.   Like a dull actor now,   I have forgot my part, and I am out,   Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,   Forgive my tyranny, but do not say   For that, “Forgive our Romans.”      [ They kiss. ]      O, a kiss   Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!   Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss   I carried from thee, dear, and my true lip   Hath virgined it e’er since. You gods! I prate   And the most noble mother of the world   Leave unsaluted. Sink, my knee, i’ th’ earth;      [ Kneels. ]      Of thy deep duty more impression show   Than that of common sons.        VOLUMNIA.   O, stand up blest,      [ He rises .]      Whilst with no softer cushion than the flint   I kneel before thee and unproperly   Show duty, as mistaken all this while   Between the child and parent.      [ She kneels. ]      CORIOLANUS.   What is this?   Your knees to me? To your corrected son?      [ He raises her up. ]      Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach   Fillip the stars! Then let the mutinous winds   Strike the proud cedars ’gainst the fiery sun,   Murdering impossibility to make   What cannot be slight work.        VOLUMNIA.   Thou art my warrior;   I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?        CORIOLANUS.   The noble sister of Publicola,   The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle   That’s curdied by the frost from purest snow   And hangs on Dian’s temple!—Dear Valeria.        VOLUMNIA.   This is a poor epitome of yours,   Which by th’ interpretation of full time   May show like all yourself.        CORIOLANUS.   The god of soldiers,   With the consent of supreme Jove, inform   Thy thoughts with nobleness, that thou mayst prove   To shame unvulnerable, and stick i’ th’ wars   Like a great seamark standing every flaw   And saving those that eye thee.        VOLUMNIA.   [ To young Martius .] Your knee, sirrah.      [ He kneels. ]      CORIOLANUS.   That’s my brave boy!        VOLUMNIA.   Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself   Are suitors to you.      [ Young  Martius  rises. ]      CORIOLANUS.   I beseech you, peace;   Or, if you’d ask, remember this before:   The thing I have forsworn to grant may never   Be held by you denials. Do not bid me   Dismiss my soldiers or capitulate   Again with Rome’s mechanics. Tell me not   Wherein I seem unnatural; desire not   T’ allay my rages and revenges with   Your colder reasons.        VOLUMNIA.   O, no more, no more!   You have said you will not grant us anything;   For we have nothing else to ask but that   Which you deny already. Yet we will ask,   That if you fail in our request, the blame   May hang upon your hardness. Therefore hear us.        CORIOLANUS.   Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark, for we’ll   Hear naught from Rome in private. Your request?        VOLUMNIA.   Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment   And state of bodies would bewray what life   We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself   How more unfortunate than all living women   Are we come hither; since that thy sight, which should   Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts,   Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow,   Making the mother, wife, and child to see   The son, the husband, and the father tearing   His country’s bowels out. And to poor we   Thine enmity’s most capital. Thou barr’st us   Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort   That all but we enjoy. For how can we—   Alas, how can we—for our country pray,   Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,   Whereto we are bound? Alack, or we must lose   The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,   Our comfort in the country. We must find   An evident calamity, though we had   Our wish, which side should win, for either thou   Must as a foreign recreant be led   With manacles through our streets, or else   Triumphantly tread on thy country’s ruin   And bear the palm for having bravely shed   Thy wife and children’s blood. For myself, son,   I purpose not to wait on fortune till   These wars determine. If I cannot persuade thee   Rather to show a noble grace to both parts   Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner   March to assault thy country than to tread—   Trust to’t, thou shalt not—on thy mother’s womb   That brought thee to this world.        VIRGILIA.   Ay, and mine,   That brought you forth this boy to keep your name   Living to time.        YOUNG MARTIUS.   He shall not tread on me.   I’ll run away till I am bigger, but then I’ll fight.        CORIOLANUS.   Not of a woman’s tenderness to be   Requires nor child nor woman’s face to see.—   I have sat too long.      [ He rises. ]      VOLUMNIA.   Nay, go not from us thus.   If it were so, that our request did tend   To save the Romans, thereby to destroy   The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us   As poisonous of your honour. No, our suit   Is that you reconcile them, while the Volsces   May say “This mercy we have showed,” the Romans   “This we received,” and each in either side   Give the all-hail to thee and cry, “Be blessed   For making up this peace!” Thou know’st, great son,   The end of war’s uncertain, but this certain,   That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit   Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name   Whose repetition will be dogged with curses,   Whose chronicle thus writ: “The man was noble,   But with his last attempt he wiped it out;   Destroyed his country, and his name remains   To th’ ensuing age abhorred.” Speak to me, son.   Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour   To imitate the graces of the gods,   To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o’ th’ air   And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt   That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?   Think’st thou it honourable for a noble man   Still to remember wrongs?—Daughter, speak you.   He cares not for your weeping.—Speak thou, boy.   Perhaps thy childishness will move him more   Than can our reasons.—There’s no man in the world   More bound to’s mother, yet here he lets me prate   Like one i’ th’ stocks. Thou hast never in thy life   Showed thy dear mother any courtesy   When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,   Has clucked thee to the wars and safely home,   Loaden with honour. Say my request’s unjust   And spurn me back; but if it be not so,   Thou art not honest, and the gods will plague thee   That thou restrain’st from me the duty which   To a mother’s part belongs.—He turns away.—   Down, ladies! Let us shame him with our knees.   To his surname Coriolanus ’longs more pride   Than pity to our prayers. Down! An end.      [ They kneel. ]      This is the last. So we will home to Rome   And die among our neighbours.—Nay, behold’s.   This boy that cannot tell what he would have,   But kneels and holds up hands for fellowship,   Does reason our petition with more strength   Than thou hast to deny’t.—Come, let us go.      [ They rise. ]      This fellow had a Volscian to his mother,   His wife is in Corioles, and his child   Like him by chance.—Yet give us our dispatch.   I am hushed until our city be afire,   And then I’ll speak a little.      [ He holds her by the hand, silent. ]      CORIOLANUS.   O mother, mother!   What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,   The gods look down, and this unnatural scene   They laugh at. O my mother, mother, O!   You have won a happy victory to Rome,   But, for your son—believe it, O, believe it!—   Most dangerously you have with him prevailed,   If not most mortal to him. But let it come.—   Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,   I’ll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,   Were you in my stead, would you have heard   A mother less? Or granted less, Aufidius?        AUFIDIUS.   I was moved withal.        CORIOLANUS.   I dare be sworn you were.   And, sir, it is no little thing to make   Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,   What peace you’ll make, advise me. For my part,   I’ll not to Rome, I’ll back with you; and pray you,   Stand to me in this cause.—O mother!—Wife!      [ He speaks with them aside. ]      AUFIDIUS.   [ Aside .] I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and thy honour   At difference in thee. Out of that I’ll work   Myself a former fortune.        CORIOLANUS.   [ To the Women .] Ay, by and by;   But we’ll drink together, and you shall bear   A better witness back than words, which we,   On like conditions, will have countersealed.   Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve   To have a temple built you. All the swords   In Italy, and her confederate arms,   Could not have made this peace.      [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE IV. Rome. A public place       Enter  Menenius  and   Sicinius .        MENENIUS.   See you yond coign o’ the Capitol, yond cornerstone?        SICINIUS.   Why, what of that?        MENENIUS.   If it be possible for you to displace it with your little finger, there is some  hope the ladies of Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him. But I say  there is no hope in’t. Our throats are sentenced and stay upon execution.        SICINIUS.   Is’t possible that so short a time can alter the condition of a man?        MENENIUS.   There is differency between a grub and a butterfly, yet your butterfly was a  grub. This Martius is grown from man to dragon. He has wings; he’s more than a  creeping thing.        SICINIUS.   He loved his mother dearly.        MENENIUS.   So did he me; and he no more remembers his mother now than an eight-year-old  horse. The tartness of his face sours ripe grapes. When he walks, he moves like  an engine, and the ground shrinks before his treading. He is able to pierce a  corslet with his eye, talks like a knell, and his hum is a battery. He sits in  his state as a thing made for Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with  his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity and a heaven to throne in.        SICINIUS.   Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.        MENENIUS.   I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his mother shall bring from him.  There is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger. That shall  our poor city find, and all this is long of you.        SICINIUS.   The gods be good unto us.        MENENIUS.   No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto us. When we banished him, we  respected not them; and he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.        Enter a  Messenger .        MESSENGER.   Sir, if you’d save your life, fly to your house.   The plebeians have got your fellow tribune   And hale him up and down, all swearing if   The Roman ladies bring not comfort home,   They’ll give him death by inches.        Enter another  Messenger .        SICINIUS.   What’s the news?        SECOND MESSENGER.   Good news, good news! The ladies have prevailed.   The Volscians are dislodged and Martius gone.   A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,   No, not th’ expulsion of the Tarquins.        SICINIUS.   Friend,   Art thou certain this is true? Is’t most certain?        SECOND MESSENGER.   As certain as I know the sun is fire.   Where have you lurked that you make doubt of it?   Ne’er through an arch so hurried the blown tide   As the recomforted through th’ gates. Why, hark you!      [ Trumpets, hautboys, drums beat, all together. ]      The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries, and fifes,   Tabors and cymbals, and the shouting Romans   Make the sun dance. Hark you!      [ A shout within. ]      MENENIUS.   This is good news.   I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia   Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians   A city full; of tribunes such as you   A sea and land full. You have prayed well today.   This morning for ten thousand of your throats   I’d not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!      [ Sound still with the shouts. ]      SICINIUS.   First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next, accept my thankfulness.        SECOND MESSENGER.   Sir, we have all great cause to give great thanks.        SICINIUS.   They are near the city?        MESSENGER.   Almost at point to enter.        SICINIUS.   We’ll meet them, and help the joy.      [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE V. Rome. A street near the gate       Enter two Senators, with Ladies  (Volumnia, Virgilia,  Valeria)  passing over the stage, with other Lords.        SENATOR.   Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!   Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,   And make triumphant fires. Strew flowers before them,   Unshout the noise that banished Martius,   Repeal him with the welcome of his mother.   Cry “Welcome, ladies, welcome!”        ALL.   Welcome, ladies, welcome!      [ A flourish with drums and trumpets. ]    [ Exeunt. ]        SCENE VI. Antium. A public place       Enter  Tullus Aufidius  with Attendants.        AUFIDIUS.   Go tell the lords o’ th’ city I am here.   Deliver them this paper.      [ He gives them a paper .]      Having read it,   Bid them repair to th’ marketplace, where I,   Even in theirs and in the commons’ ears,   Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse   The city ports by this hath entered and   Intends t’ appear before the people, hoping   To purge himself with words. Dispatch.      [ Exeunt Attendants. ]      Enter three or four  Conspirators  of   Aufidius’s  faction.        Most welcome!        FIRST CONSPIRATOR.   How is it with our general?        AUFIDIUS.   Even so   As with a man by his own alms empoisoned   And with his charity slain.        SECOND CONSPIRATOR.   Most noble sir,   If you do hold the same intent wherein   You wished us parties, we’ll deliver you   Of your great danger.        AUFIDIUS.   Sir, I cannot tell.   We must proceed as we do find the people.        THIRD CONSPIRATOR.   The people will remain uncertain whilst   ’Twixt you there’s difference, but the fall of either   Makes the survivor heir of all.        AUFIDIUS.   I know it,   And my pretext to strike at him admits   A good construction. I raised him, and I pawned   Mine honour for his truth, who being so heightened,   He watered his new plants with dews of flattery,   Seducing so my friends; and to this end,   He bowed his nature, never known before   But to be rough, unswayable, and free.        THIRD CONSPIRATOR.   Sir, his stoutness   When he did stand for consul, which he lost   By lack of stooping—        AUFIDIUS.   That I would have spoke of.   Being banished for’t, he came unto my hearth,   Presented to my knife his throat. I took him,   Made him joint servant with me, gave him way   In all his own desires; nay, let him choose   Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,   My best and freshest men; served his designments   In mine own person; holp to reap the fame   Which he did end all his; and took some pride   To do myself this wrong; till at the last   I seemed his follower, not partner; and   He waged me with his countenance as if   I had been mercenary.        FIRST CONSPIRATOR.   So he did, my lord.   The army marvelled at it, and, in the last,   When he had carried Rome and that we looked   For no less spoil than glory—        AUFIDIUS.   There was it   For which my sinews shall be stretched upon him.   At a few drops of women’s rheum, which are   As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour   Of our great action. Therefore shall he die,   And I’ll renew me in his fall. But, hark!      [ Drums and trumpets sound, with great shouts of the people. ]      FIRST CONSPIRATOR.   Your native town you entered like a post   And had no welcomes home, but he returns   Splitting the air with noise.        SECOND CONSPIRATOR.   And patient fools,   Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear   With giving him glory.        THIRD CONSPIRATOR.   Therefore at your vantage,   Ere he express himself or move the people   With what he would say, let him feel your sword,   Which we will second. When he lies along,   After your way his tale pronounced shall bury   His reasons with his body.        AUFIDIUS.   Say no more.   Here come the lords.        Enter the  Lords  of the city.        ALL LORDS.   You are most welcome home.        AUFIDIUS.   I have not deserved it.   But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused   What I have written to you?        ALL LORDS.   We have.        FIRST LORD.   And grieve to hear’t.   What faults he made before the last, I think   Might have found easy fines, but there to end   Where he was to begin and give away   The benefit of our levies, answering us   With our own charge, making a treaty where   There was a yielding—this admits no excuse.        Enter  Coriolanus  marching with Drum and Colours, the  Commoners being with him.        AUFIDIUS.   He approaches. You shall hear him.        CORIOLANUS.   Hail, lords! I am returned your soldier,   No more infected with my country’s love   Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting   Under your great command. You are to know   That prosperously I have attempted, and   With bloody passage led your wars even to   The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home   Doth more than counterpoise a full third part   The charges of the action. We have made peace   With no less honour to the Antiates   Than shame to th’ Romans, and we here deliver,   Subscribed by th’ Consuls and patricians,   Together with the seal o’ th’ Senate, what   We have compounded on.      [ He offers the lords a paper. ]      AUFIDIUS.   Read it not, noble lords,   But tell the traitor in the highest degree   He hath abused your powers.        CORIOLANUS.   “Traitor?” How now?        AUFIDIUS.   Ay, traitor, Martius.        CORIOLANUS.   Martius?        AUFIDIUS.   Ay, Martius, Caius Martius. Dost thou think   I’ll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol’n name   Coriolanus, in Corioles?   You lords and heads o’ th’ state, perfidiously   He has betrayed your business and given up   For certain drops of salt your city Rome—   I say your city—to his wife and mother,   Breaking his oath and resolution like   A twist of rotten silk, never admitting   Counsel o’ th’ war, but at his nurse’s tears   He whined and roared away your victory,   That pages blushed at him and men of heart   Looked wond’ring each at other.        CORIOLANUS.   Hear’st thou, Mars?        AUFIDIUS.   Name not the god, thou boy of tears.        CORIOLANUS.   Ha?        AUFIDIUS.   No more.        CORIOLANUS.   Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart   Too great for what contains it. “Boy”? O slave!—   Pardon me, lords, ’tis the first time that ever   I was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,   Must give this cur the lie; and his own notion—   Who wears my stripes impressed upon him, that   Must bear my beating to his grave—shall join   To thrust the lie unto him.        FIRST LORD.   Peace, both, and hear me speak.        CORIOLANUS.   Cut me to pieces, Volsces. Men and lads,   Stain all your edges on me. “Boy”? False hound!   If you have writ your annals true, ’tis there,   That like an eagle in a dovecote, I   Fluttered your Volscians in Corioles,   Alone I did it. “Boy”!        AUFIDIUS.   Why, noble lords,   Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,   Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,   ’Fore your own eyes and ears?        ALL CONSPIRATORS.   Let him die for’t.        ALL PEOPLE   Tear him to pieces! Do it presently! He killed my son! My daughter! He killed  my cousin Marcus! He killed my father!        SECOND LORD.   Peace, ho! No outrage! Peace!   The man is noble, and his fame folds in   This orb o’ th’ Earth. His last offences to us   Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,   And trouble not the peace.        CORIOLANUS.   O that I had him,   With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,   To use my lawful sword.        AUFIDIUS.   Insolent villain!        ALL CONSPIRATORS.   Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!        [ Draw the  Conspirators , and kills  Martius , who falls.  Aufidius  stands on him. ]        LORDS.   Hold, hold, hold, hold!        AUFIDIUS.   My noble masters, hear me speak.        FIRST LORD.   O Tullus!        SECOND LORD.   Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.        THIRD LORD.   Tread not upon him.—Masters, all be quiet.—   Put up your swords.        AUFIDIUS.   My lords, when you shall know—as in this rage,   Provoked by him, you cannot—the great danger   Which this man’s life did owe you, you’ll rejoice   That he is thus cut off. Please it your Honours   To call me to your senate, I’ll deliver   Myself your loyal servant, or endure   Your heaviest censure.        FIRST LORD.   Bear from hence his body,   And mourn you for him. Let him be regarded   As the most noble corse that ever herald   Did follow to his urn.        SECOND LORD.   His own impatience   Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.   Let’s make the best of it.        AUFIDIUS.   My rage is gone,   And I am struck with sorrow.—Take him up.   Help, three o’ th’ chiefest soldiers; I’ll be one.—   Beat thou the drum that it speak mournfully.—   Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he   Hath widowed and unchilded many a one,   Which to this hour bewail the injury,   Yet he shall have a noble memory.   Assist.      [ Exeunt, bearing the body of   Martius . A dead march sounded. ]           <a '"
