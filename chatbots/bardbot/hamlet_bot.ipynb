How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable   Seem to me all the uses of this world!   Fie on’t! Oh fie! ’tis an unweeded garden   That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature   Possess it merely. That it should come to this!   But two months dead—nay, not so much, not two:   So excellent a king; that was to this   Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother,   That he might not beteem the winds of heaven   Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!   Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him   As if increase of appetite had grown   By what it fed on; and yet, within a month—   Let me not think on’t—Frailty, thy name is woman!   A little month, or ere those shoes were old   With which she followed my poor father’s body   Like Niobe, all tears.—Why she, even she—   O God! A beast that wants discourse of reason   Would have mourn’d longer,—married with mine uncle,   My father’s brother; but no more like my father   Than I to Hercules. Within a month,   Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears   Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,   She married. O most wicked speed, to post   With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!   It is not, nor it cannot come to good.   But break, my heart, for I must hold my tongue.         Enter  Horatio, Marcellus  and  Barnardo .\n",

      "I prithee do not mock me, fellow-student.   I think it was to see my mother’s wedding.\n",
      "Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak’d meats   Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.   Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven   Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio.   My father,—methinks I see my father.\n",

I pray you all,   If you have hitherto conceal’d this sight,   Let it be tenable in your silence still;   And whatsoever else shall hap tonight,   Give it an understanding, but no tongue.

      "Ay marry is’t;   And to my mind, though I am native here,   And to the manner born, it is a custom   More honour’d in the breach than the observance.   This heavy-headed revel east and west   Makes us traduc’d and tax’d of other nations:   They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase   Soil our addition; and indeed it takes   From our achievements, though perform’d at height,   The pith and marrow of our attribute.   So oft it chances in particular men   That for some vicious mole of nature in them,   As in their birth, wherein they are not guilty,   Since nature cannot choose his origin,   By their o’ergrowth of some complexion,   Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason;   Or by some habit, that too much o’erleavens   The form of plausive manners;—that these men,   Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,   Being Nature’s livery or Fortune’s star,—   His virtues else,—be they as pure as grace,   As infinite as man may undergo,   Shall in the general censure take corruption   From that particular fault. The dram of evil   Doth all the noble substance of a doubt   To his own scandal.\n",
      "Angels and ministers of grace defend us!   Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn’d,   Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,   Be thy intents wicked or charitable,   Thou com’st in such a questionable shape   That I will speak to thee. I’ll call thee Hamlet,   King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me!   Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell   Why thy canoniz’d bones, hearsed in death,   Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,   Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn’d,   Hath op’d his ponderous and marble jaws   To cast thee up again! What may this mean,   That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,   Revisit’st thus the glimpses of the moon,   Making night hideous, and we fools of nature   So horridly to shake our disposition   With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?   Say, why is this? Wherefore? What should we do?         \n",
      "It will not speak; then will I follow it.\n",
      "Why, what should be the fear?   I do not set my life at a pin’s fee;   And for my soul, what can it do to that,   Being a thing immortal as itself?   It waves me forth again. I’ll follow it.\n",
      "It waves me still.   Go on, I’ll follow thee.\n",
      "Hold off your hands.\n",
      "My fate cries out,   And makes each petty artery in this body   As hardy as the Nemean lion’s nerve.         [  Ghost  beckons. ]        Still am I call’d. Unhand me, gentlemen.        [ Breaking free from them. ]        By heaven, I’ll make a ghost of him that lets me.   I say, away!—Go on, I’ll follow thee.         [ Exeunt  Ghost  and  Hamlet . ]\n",

      "O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?   And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, my heart;   And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,   But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?   Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat   In this distracted globe. Remember thee?   Yea, from the table of my memory   I’ll wipe away all trivial fond records,   All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,   That youth and observation copied there;   And thy commandment all alone shall live   Within the book and volume of my brain,   Unmix’d with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!   O most pernicious woman!   O villain, villain, smiling damned villain!   My tables. Meet it is I set it down,   That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain!   At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.                 So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;   It is ‘Adieu, adieu, remember me.’   I have sworn’t.\n",

      "O, wonderful!\n",
      "No, you’ll reveal it.\n",
      "How say you then, would heart of man once think it?—   But you’ll be secret?\n",
      "There’s ne’er a villain dwelling in all Denmark   But he’s an arrant knave.\n",
      "Why, right; you are i’ the right;   And so, without more circumstance at all,   I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:   You, as your business and desire shall point you,—   For every man hath business and desire,   Such as it is;—and for my own poor part,   Look you, I’ll go pray.\n",
      "I’m sorry they offend you, heartily;   Yes faith, heartily.\n",
      "Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,   And much offence too. Touching this vision here,   It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.   For your desire to know what is between us,   O’ermaster’t as you may. And now, good friends,   As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,   Give me one poor request.\n",
      "Never make known what you have seen tonight.\n",
      "Nay, but swear’t.\n",
      "Upon my sword.\n",
      "Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.\n",
      "Ha, ha boy, sayst thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?   Come on, you hear this fellow in the cellarage.   Consent to swear.\n",
      "Never to speak of this that you have seen.   Swear by my sword.\n",
      "Hic et ubique?  Then we’ll shift our ground.   Come hither, gentlemen,   And lay your hands again upon my sword.   Never to speak of this that you have heard.   Swear by my sword.\n",
      "Well said, old mole! Canst work i’ th’earth so fast?   A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.\n",
      "And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.   There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,   Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come,   Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,   How strange or odd soe’er I bear myself,—   As I perchance hereafter shall think meet   To put an antic disposition on—   That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,   With arms encumber’d thus, or this head-shake,   Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,   As ‘Well, we know’, or ‘We could and if we would’,   Or ‘If we list to speak’; or ‘There be and if they might’,   Or such ambiguous giving out, to note   That you know aught of me:—this not to do.   So grace and mercy at your most need help you,   Swear.\n",
      "Rest, rest, perturbed spirit. So, gentlemen,   With all my love I do commend me to you;   And what so poor a man as Hamlet is   May do t’express his love and friending to you,   God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together,   And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.   The time is out of joint. O cursed spite,   That ever I was born to set it right.   Nay, come, let’s go together.         \n",
      "This in obedience hath my daughter show’d me;   And more above, hath his solicitings,   As they fell out by time, by means, and place,   All given to mine ear.\n",
      "Well, God-a-mercy.\n",
      "Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.\n",
      "Then I would you were so honest a man.\n",
      "Ay sir, to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten  thousand.\n",
      "For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a good kissing carrion,—   Have you a daughter?\n",
      "Let her not walk i’ th’ sun. Conception is a blessing, but not as your daughter  may conceive. Friend, look to’t.\n",
      "Words, words, words.\n",
      "Between who?\n",
      "Slanders, sir. For the satirical slave says here that old men have grey beards;  that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree  gum; and that they have a plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams.  All which, sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it  not honesty to have it thus set down. For you yourself, sir, should be old as I  am, if like a crab you could go backward.\n",
      "Into my grave?\n",
      "You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more willingly part withal,  except my life, except my life, except my life.\n",
      "These tedious old fools.         Enter  Rosencrantz  and  Guildenstern .\n",
      "My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz. Good  lads, how do ye both?\n",
      "Nor the soles of her shoe?\n",
      "Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favours?\n",
      "In the secret parts of Fortune? O, most true; she is a strumpet. What’s the  news?\n",
      "Then is doomsday near. But your news is not true. Let me question more in  particular. What have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of Fortune,  that she sends you to prison hither?\n",
      "Denmark’s a prison.\n",
      "A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and dungeons, Denmark  being one o’ th’ worst.\n",
      "Why, then ’tis none to you; for there is nothing either good or bad but  thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.\n",
      "O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a king of infinite  space, were it not that I have bad dreams.\n",
      "A dream itself is but a shadow.\n",
      "Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch’d heroes the  beggars’ shadows. Shall we to th’ court? For, by my fay, I cannot reason.\n",
      "No such matter. I will not sort you with the rest of my servants; for, to speak  to you like an honest man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the beaten  way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?\n",
      "Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you. And sure, dear  friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it your  own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come;  nay, speak.\n",
      "Why, anything. But to the purpose. You were sent for; and there is a kind of  confession in your looks, which your modesties have not craft enough to colour.  I know the good King and Queen have sent for you.\n",
      "That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights of our  fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the obligation of our  ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you  withal, be even and direct with me, whether you were sent for or no.\n",
      " Nay, then I have an eye of you. If you love me, hold not off.\n",
      "I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your  secrecy to the King and Queen moult no feather. I have of late, but wherefore I  know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it  goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth, seems to  me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy the air, look you, this  brave o’erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire,  why, it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of  vapours. What a piece of work is man, how noble in reason, how infinite in  faculties, in form and moving, how express and admirable; in action how like an  angel, in apprehension, how like a god: the beauty of the world, the paragon of  animals. And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not  me; no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.\n",
      "Why did you laugh then, when I said ‘Man delights not me’?\n",
      "He that plays the king shall be welcome,—his Majesty shall have tribute of me;  the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not sigh  gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in peace; the clown shall make  those laugh whose lungs are tickle o’ th’ sere; and the lady shall say her mind  freely, or the blank verse shall halt for’t. What players are they?\n",
      "How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in reputation and profit, was  better both ways.\n",
      "Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city? Are they so  followed?\n",
      "How comes it? Do they grow rusty?\n",
      "What, are they children? Who maintains ’em? How are they escoted? Will they  pursue the quality no longer than they can sing? Will they not say afterwards,  if they should grow themselves to common players—as it is most like, if their  means are no better—their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against  their own succession?\n",
      "Is’t possible?\n",
      "Do the boys carry it away?\n",
      "It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and those that would  make mouths at him while my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred  ducats apiece for his picture in little. ’Sblood, there is something in this  more than natural, if philosophy could find it out.        \n",
      "Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come. The appurtenance of  welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply with you in this garb, lest my  extent to the players, which I tell you must show fairly outward, should more  appear like entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my uncle-father and  aunt-mother are deceived.\n",
      "I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly, I know a hawk from a  handsaw.        Enter  Polonius .\n",
      "Hark you, Guildenstern, and you too, at each ear a hearer. That great baby you  see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts.\n",
      "I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it.—You say right,  sir: for a Monday morning ’twas so indeed.\n",
      "My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in Rome—\n",
      "Buzz, buzz.\n",
      "Then came each actor on his ass—\n",
      "O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!\n",
      "Why—      ’One fair daughter, and no more,      The which he loved passing well.’\n",
      "Am I not i’ th’ right, old Jephthah?\n",
      "Nay, that follows not.\n",
      "Why,      As by lot, God wot,   and then, you know,      It came to pass, as most like it was.   The first row of the pious chanson will show you more. For look where my  abridgement comes.        Enter four or five  Players .        You are welcome, masters, welcome all. I am glad to see thee well. Welcome,  good friends. O, my old friend! Thy face is valanc’d since I saw thee last.  Com’st thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young lady and mistress! By’r  lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the  altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of uncurrent gold, be  not cracked within the ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We’ll e’en to’t like  French falconers, fly at anything we see. We’ll have a speech straight. Come,  give us a taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.\n",
      "I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted, or if it was, not  above once, for the play, I remember, pleased not the million, ’twas caviare to  the general. But it was—as I received it, and others, whose judgements in such  matters cried in the top of mine—an excellent play, well digested in the  scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said there  were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury, nor no matter in the  phrase that might indite the author of affectation, but called it an honest  method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One  speech in it, I chiefly loved. ’Twas Aeneas’ tale to Dido, and thereabout of it  especially where he speaks of Priam’s slaughter. If it live in your memory,  begin at this line, let me see, let me see:       The rugged Pyrrhus, like th’ Hyrcanian beast,—    It is not so: it begins with Pyrrhus—       The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,      Black as his purpose, did the night resemble      When he lay couched in the ominous horse,      Hath now this dread and black complexion smear’d      With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot      Now is he total gules, horridly trick’d      With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,      Bak’d and impasted with the parching streets,      That lend a tyrannous and a damned light      To their vile murders. Roasted in wrath and fire,      And thus o’ersized with coagulate gore,      With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus      Old grandsire Priam seeks.    So, proceed you.\n",
      "It shall to the barber’s, with your beard.—Prithee say on.   He’s for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps.   Say on; come to Hecuba.\n",
      "‘The mobled queen’?\n",
      "’Tis well. I’ll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.—Good my lord, will  you see the players well bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for they  are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time. After your death you were  better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.\n",
      "God’s bodikin, man, much better. Use every man after his desert, and who should  ’scape whipping? Use them after your own honour and dignity. The less they  deserve, the more merit is in your bounty. Take them in.\n",
      "Follow him, friends. We’ll hear a play tomorrow.                 Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play  The Murder of Gonzago ?\n",
      "We’ll ha’t tomorrow night. You could for a need study a speech of some dozen or  sixteen lines, which I would set down and insert in’t, could you not?\n",
      "Very well. Follow that lord, and look you mock him not.         [ Exit  First Player . ]        [ To Rosencrantz and Guildenstern ] My good friends, I’ll leave you till  night. You are welcome to Elsinore.\n",
      "Ay, so, God b’ wi’ ye. Now I am alone.   O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!   Is it not monstrous that this player here,   But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,   Could force his soul so to his own conceit   That from her working all his visage wan’d;   Tears in his eyes, distraction in’s aspect,   A broken voice, and his whole function suiting   With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!   For Hecuba?   What’s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,   That he should weep for her? What would he do,   Had he the motive and the cue for passion   That I have? He would drown the stage with tears   And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;   Make mad the guilty, and appal the free,   Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed,   The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,   A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak   Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,   And can say nothing. No, not for a king   Upon whose property and most dear life   A damn’d defeat was made. Am I a coward?   Who calls me villain, breaks my pate across?   Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?   Tweaks me by the nose, gives me the lie i’ th’ throat   As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this?   Ha! ’Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be   But I am pigeon-liver’d, and lack gall   To make oppression bitter, or ere this   I should have fatted all the region kites   With this slave’s offal. Bloody, bawdy villain!   Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!   Oh vengeance!   Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,   That I, the son of a dear father murder’d,   Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,   Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words   And fall a-cursing like a very drab,   A scullion! Fie upon’t! Foh!   About, my brain! I have heard   That guilty creatures sitting at a play,   Have by the very cunning of the scene,   Been struck so to the soul that presently   They have proclaim’d their malefactions.   For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak   With most miraculous organ. I’ll have these players   Play something like the murder of my father   Before mine uncle. I’ll observe his looks;   I’ll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,   I know my course. The spirit that I have seen   May be the devil, and the devil hath power   T’assume a pleasing shape, yea, and perhaps   Out of my weakness and my melancholy,   As he is very potent with such spirits,   Abuses me to damn me. I’ll have grounds   More relative than this. The play’s the thing   Wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the King.         \n",
      "To be, or not to be, that is the question:   Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer   The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,   Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,   And by opposing end them? To die—to sleep,   No more; and by a sleep to say we end   The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks   That flesh is heir to: ’tis a consummation   Devoutly to be wish’d. To die, to sleep.   To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there’s the rub,   For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,   When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,   Must give us pause. There’s the respect   That makes calamity of so long life.   For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,   The oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,   The pangs of dispriz’d love, the law’s delay,   The insolence of office, and the spurns   That patient merit of the unworthy takes,   When he himself might his quietus make   With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,   To grunt and sweat under a weary life,   But that the dread of something after death,   The undiscover’d country, from whose bourn   No traveller returns, puzzles the will,   And makes us rather bear those ills we have   Than fly to others that we know not of?   Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,   And thus the native hue of resolution   Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,   And enterprises of great pith and moment,   With this regard their currents turn awry   And lose the name of action. Soft you now,   The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons   Be all my sins remember’d.\n",
      "I humbly thank you; well, well, well.\n",
      "No, not I.   I never gave you aught.\n",
      "Ha, ha! Are you honest?\n",
      "Are you fair?\n",
      "That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your  beauty.\n",
      "Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it  is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness.  This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof. I did love you  once.\n",
      "You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock  but we shall relish of it. I loved you not.\n",
      "Get thee to a nunnery. Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am myself  indifferent honest; but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were  better my mother had not borne me. I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious, with  more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to  give them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I do  crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves all, believe none of  us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where’s your father?\n",
      "Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool nowhere but in’s own  house. Farewell.\n",
      "If thou dost marry, I’ll give thee this plague for thy dowry. Be thou as chaste  as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a nunnery,  go: farewell. Or if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well  enough what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.  Farewell.\n",
      "I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath given you one face,  and you make yourselves another. You jig, you amble, and you lisp, and nickname  God’s creatures, and make your wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I’ll no more  on’t, it hath made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages. Those that  are married already, all but one, shall live; the rest shall keep as they are.  To a nunnery, go.        \n",
      "Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the  tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of your players do, I had as lief the  town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand,  thus, but use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,  whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it  smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated  fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the  groundlings, who, for the most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable  dumb shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipped for o’erdoing  Termagant. It out-Herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.\n",
      "Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your tutor. Suit the  action to the word, the word to the action, with this special observance, that  you o’erstep not the modesty of nature; for anything so overdone is from the  purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold  as ’twere the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, scorn her  own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now,  this overdone, or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot  but make the judicious grieve; the censure of the which one must in your  allowance o’erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I have  seen play—and heard others praise, and that highly—not to speak it profanely,  that, neither having the accent of Christians, nor the gait of Christian,  pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of  Nature’s journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated  humanity so abominably.\n",
      "O reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak no more than  is set down for them. For there be of them that will themselves laugh, to set  on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too, though in the meantime some  necessary question of the play be then to be considered. That’s villainous, and  shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go make you ready.                Enter  Polonius, Rosencrantz  and  Guildenstern .        How now, my lord?   Will the King hear this piece of work?\n",
      "Bid the players make haste.                 Will you two help to hasten them?\n",
      "What ho, Horatio!         Enter  Horatio .\n",
      "Horatio, thou art e’en as just a man   As e’er my conversation cop’d withal.\n",
      "Nay, do not think I flatter;   For what advancement may I hope from thee,   That no revenue hast, but thy good spirits   To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter’d?   No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,   And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee   Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?   Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice,   And could of men distinguish, her election   Hath seal’d thee for herself. For thou hast been   As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,   A man that Fortune’s buffets and rewards   Hast ta’en with equal thanks. And blessed are those   Whose blood and judgement are so well co-mingled   That they are not a pipe for Fortune’s finger   To sound what stop she please. Give me that man   That is not passion’s slave, and I will wear him   In my heart’s core, ay, in my heart of heart,   As I do thee. Something too much of this.   There is a play tonight before the King.   One scene of it comes near the circumstance   Which I have told thee, of my father’s death.   I prithee, when thou see’st that act a-foot,   Even with the very comment of thy soul   Observe mine uncle. If his occulted guilt   Do not itself unkennel in one speech,   It is a damned ghost that we have seen;   And my imaginations are as foul   As Vulcan’s stithy. Give him heedful note;   For I mine eyes will rivet to his face;   And after we will both our judgements join   In censure of his seeming.\n",
      "They are coming to the play. I must be idle.   Get you a place.         Danish march. A flourish. Enter  King, Queen, Polonius,  Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern  and others.\n",
      "Excellent, i’ faith; of the chameleon’s dish: I eat the air, promise-crammed:  you cannot feed capons so.\n",
      "No, nor mine now.  My lord, you play’d once i’  th’university, you say?\n",
      "What did you enact?\n",
      "It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be the players  ready?\n",
      "No, good mother, here’s metal more attractive.\n",
      "Lady, shall I lie in your lap?         \n",
      "I mean, my head upon your lap?\n",
      "Do you think I meant country matters?\n",
      "That’s a fair thought to lie between maids’ legs.\n",
      "Nothing.\n",
      "Who, I?\n",
      "O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry? For look you how  cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within’s two hours.\n",
      "So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I’ll have a suit of sables. O  heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there’s hope a great  man’s memory may outlive his life half a year. But by’r lady, he must build  churches then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse,  whose epitaph is ‘For, O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!’        Trumpets sound. The dumb show enters.         Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him and he her.  She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her up, and  declines his head upon her neck. Lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She,  seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown,  kisses it, pours poison in the King’s ears, and exits. The Queen returns, finds  the King dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner with some three or  four Mutes, comes in again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is  carried away. The Poisoner woos the Queen with gifts. She seems loth and  unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love.         \n",

      "No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i’ th’ world.\n",
      "The Mousetrap.  Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the image of a  murder done in Vienna. Gonzago is the Duke’s name, his wife Baptista: you shall  see anon; ’tis a knavish piece of work: but what o’ that? Your majesty, and we  that have free souls, it touches us not. Let the gall’d jade wince; our withers  are unwrung.        Enter  Lucianus .        This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.\n",

      "Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You would play upon me;  you would seem to know my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my mystery;  you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is  much music, excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it  speak. ’Sblood, do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe?

O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever   The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:   Let me be cruel, not unnatural.   I will speak daggers to her, but use none;   My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites.   How in my words somever she be shent,   To give them seals never, my soul, consent.         [ Exit. ]\n",

He took my father grossly, full of bread,   With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;   And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?   But in our circumstance and course of thought,   ’Tis heavy with him. And am I then reveng’d,   To take him in the purging of his soul,   When he is fit and season’d for his passage? No.   Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent:   When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage,   Or in th’incestuous pleasure of his bed,   At gaming, swearing; or about some act   That has no relish of salvation in’t,   Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,   And that his soul may be as damn’d and black   As hell, whereto it goes.

Take thy fortune,   Thou find’st to be too busy is some danger.—   Leave wringing of your hands. Peace, sit you down,   And let me wring your heart, for so I shall,   If it be made of penetrable stuff;   If damned custom have not braz’d it so,   That it is proof and bulwark against sense.\n",
      "Such an act   That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,   Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose   From the fair forehead of an innocent love,   And sets a blister there. Makes marriage vows   As false as dicers’ oaths. O such a deed   As from the body of contraction plucks   The very soul, and sweet religion makes   A rhapsody of words. Heaven’s face doth glow,   Yea this solidity and compound mass,   With tristful visage, as against the doom,   Is thought-sick at the act.\n",
      "Look here upon this picture, and on this,   The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.   See what a grace was seated on this brow,   Hyperion’s curls, the front of Jove himself,   An eye like Mars, to threaten and command,   A station like the herald Mercury   New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:   A combination and a form indeed,   Where every god did seem to set his seal,   To give the world assurance of a man.   This was your husband. Look you now what follows.   Here is your husband, like a mildew’d ear   Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?   Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,   And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?   You cannot call it love; for at your age   The hey-day in the blood is tame, it’s humble,   And waits upon the judgement: and what judgement   Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,   Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense   Is apoplex’d, for madness would not err   Nor sense to ecstacy was ne’er so thrall’d   But it reserv’d some quantity of choice   To serve in such a difference. What devil was’t   That thus hath cozen’d you at hoodman-blind?   Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,   Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,   Or but a sickly part of one true sense   Could not so mope. O shame! where is thy blush?   Rebellious hell,   If thou canst mutine in a matron’s bones,   To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,   And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame   When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,   Since frost itself as actively doth burn,   And reason panders will.\n",
      "Nay, but to live   In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,   Stew’d in corruption, honeying and making love   Over the nasty sty.\n",
      "A murderer and a villain;   A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe   Of your precedent lord. A vice of kings,   A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,   That from a shelf the precious diadem stole   And put it in his pocket!\n",
      "A king of shreds and patches!—         Enter  Ghost .        Save me and hover o’er me with your wings,   You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?\n",
      "Do you not come your tardy son to chide,   That, laps’d in time and passion, lets go by   The important acting of your dread command?   O say!\n",
      "How is it with you, lady?\n",
      "On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares,   His form and cause conjoin’d, preaching to stones,   Would make them capable.—Do not look upon me,   Lest with this piteous action you convert   My stern effects. Then what I have to do   Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.\n",
      "Do you see nothing there?\n",
      "Nor did you nothing hear?\n",
      "Why, look you there! look how it steals away!   My father, in his habit as he liv’d!   Look where he goes even now out at the portal.         \n",
      "Ecstasy!   My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time,   And makes as healthful music. It is not madness   That I have utter’d. Bring me to the test,   And I the matter will re-word; which madness   Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,   Lay not that flattering unction to your soul   That not your trespass, but my madness speaks.   It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,   Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,   Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven,   Repent what’s past, avoid what is to come;   And do not spread the compost on the weeds,   To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;   For in the fatness of these pursy times   Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,   Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.\n",
      "O throw away the worser part of it,   And live the purer with the other half.   Good night. But go not to mine uncle’s bed.   Assume a virtue, if you have it not.   That monster custom, who all sense doth eat,   Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,   That to the use of actions fair and good   He likewise gives a frock or livery   That aptly is put on. Refrain tonight,   And that shall lend a kind of easiness   To the next abstinence. The next more easy;   For use almost can change the stamp of nature,   And either curb the devil, or throw him out   With wondrous potency. Once more, good night,   And when you are desirous to be bles’d,   I’ll blessing beg of you. For this same lord      I do repent; but heaven hath pleas’d it so,   To punish me with this, and this with me,   That I must be their scourge and minister.   I will bestow him, and will answer well   The death I gave him. So again, good night.   I must be cruel, only to be kind:   Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.   One word more, good lady.\n",
      "Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:   Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed,   Pinch wanton on your cheek, call you his mouse,   And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,   Or paddling in your neck with his damn’d fingers,   Make you to ravel all this matter out,   That I essentially am not in madness,   But mad in craft. ’Twere good you let him know,   For who that’s but a queen, fair, sober, wise,   Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,   Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?   No, in despite of sense and secrecy,   Unpeg the basket on the house’s top,   Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,   To try conclusions, in the basket creep   And break your own neck down.\n",
      "I must to England, you know that?\n",
      "There’s letters seal’d: and my two schoolfellows,   Whom I will trust as I will adders fang’d,—   They bear the mandate, they must sweep my way   And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;   For ’tis the sport to have the enginer   Hoist with his own petard, and ’t shall go hard   But I will delve one yard below their mines   And blow them at the moon. O, ’tis most sweet,   When in one line two crafts directly meet.   This man shall set me packing.   I’ll lug the guts into the neighbour room.   Mother, good night. Indeed, this counsellor   Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,   Who was in life a foolish prating knave.   Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.   Good night, mother.         \n",
      "Safely stowed.\n",
      "What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.         Enter  Rosencrantz  and  Guildenstern .\n",
      "Compounded it with dust, whereto ’tis kin.\n",
      "Do not believe it.\n",
      "That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be demanded of a  sponge—what replication should be made by the son of a king?\n",
      "Ay, sir; that soaks up the King’s countenance, his rewards, his authorities.  But such officers do the King best service in the end: he keeps them, like an  ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to be last swallowed: when he  needs what you have gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you shall be  dry again.\n",
      "I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.\n",
      "The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body. The King is a  thing—\n",
      "Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.         \n",
      "At supper.\n",
      "Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain convocation of politic  worms are e’en at him. Your worm is your only emperor for diet. We fat all  creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and  your lean beggar is but variable service,—two dishes, but to one table. That’s  the end.\n",
      "A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat of the fish that  hath fed of that worm.\n",
      "Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a  beggar.\n",
      "In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not there, seek him  i’ th’other place yourself. But indeed, if you find him not within this month,  you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby.\n",
      "He will stay till you come.         \n",
      "For England?\n",
      "Good.\n",
      "I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for England! Farewell, dear mother.\n",
      "My mother. Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is one flesh; and  so, my mother. Come, for England.        \n",
      "Good sir, whose powers are these?\n",
      "How purpos’d, sir, I pray you?\n",
      "Who commands them, sir?\n",
      "Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,   Or for some frontier?\n",
      "Why, then the Polack never will defend it.\n",
      "Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats   Will not debate the question of this straw!   This is th’imposthume of much wealth and peace,   That inward breaks, and shows no cause without   Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.\n",
      "I’ll be with you straight. Go a little before.         [ Exeunt all but  Hamlet . ]        How all occasions do inform against me,   And spur my dull revenge. What is a man   If his chief good and market of his time   Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.   Sure he that made us with such large discourse,   Looking before and after, gave us not   That capability and godlike reason   To fust in us unus’d. Now whether it be   Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple   Of thinking too precisely on th’event,—   A thought which, quarter’d, hath but one part wisdom   And ever three parts coward,—I do not know   Why yet I live to say this thing’s to do,   Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means   To do’t. Examples gross as earth exhort me,   Witness this army of such mass and charge,   Led by a delicate and tender prince,   Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff’d,   Makes mouths at the invisible event,   Exposing what is mortal and unsure   To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,   Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great   Is not to stir without great argument,   But greatly to find quarrel in a straw   When honour’s at the stake. How stand I then,   That have a father kill’d, a mother stain’d,   Excitements of my reason and my blood,   And let all sleep, while to my shame I see   The imminent death of twenty thousand men   That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,   Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot   Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,   Which is not tomb enough and continent   To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,   My thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth.         [ Exit. ]\n",
      "’        Come, I will give you way for these your letters,   And do’t the speedier, that you may direct me   To him from whom you brought them.         \n",
      "’        What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?   Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?\n",
      "Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at grave-making?\n",
      "’Tis e’en so; the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense.\n",
      "That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the knave jowls it to  th’ ground, as if ’twere Cain’s jawbone, that did the first murder! This might  be the pate of a politician which this ass now o’er-offices, one that would  circumvent God, might it not?\n",
      "Or of a courtier, which could say ‘Good morrow, sweet lord! How dost thou, good  lord?’ This might be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord such-a-one’s  horse when he meant to beg it, might it not?\n",
      "Why, e’en so: and now my Lady Worm’s; chapless, and knocked about the mazard  with a sexton’s spade. Here’s fine revolution, an we had the trick to see’t.  Did these bones cost no more the breeding but to play at loggets with ’em? Mine  ache to think on’t.\n",
      "There’s another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer? Where be his  quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? Why does he  suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel,  and will not tell him of his action of battery? Hum. This fellow might be in’s  time a great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his fines,  his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine of his fines, and the  recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt? Will his  vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than the  length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands  will scarcely lie in this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?\n",
      "Is not parchment made of sheep-skins?\n",
      "They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I will speak to  this fellow.—Whose grave’s this, sir?\n",
      "I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in’t.\n",
      "Thou dost lie in’t, to be in’t and say it is thine. ’Tis for the dead, not for  the quick; therefore thou liest.\n",

      "What woman then?\n",
      "Who is to be buried in’t?\n",
      "How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or equivocation will undo  us. By the Lord, Horatio, these three years I have taken note of it, the age is  grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the  courtier he galls his kibe.—How long hast thou been a grave-maker?\n",
      "How long is that since?\n",
      "Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "How came he mad?\n",
      "How strangely?\n",

      "Nay, I know not.\n",
      "This?\n",
      "Let me see.  Alas, poor Yorick. I knew him, Horatio, a  fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He hath borne me on his back  a thousand times; and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is! My gorge rises  at it. Here hung those lips that I have kiss’d I know not how oft. Where be  your gibes now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that were  wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning? Quite  chop-fallen? Now get you to my lady’s chamber, and tell her, let her paint an  inch thick, to this favour she must come. Make her laugh at that.—Prithee,  Horatio, tell me one thing.\n",
      "Dost thou think Alexander looked o’ this fashion i’ th’earth?\n",
      "And smelt so? Pah!         \n",
      "To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not imagination trace the  noble dust of Alexander till he find it stopping a bung-hole?\n",
      "No, faith, not a jot. But to follow him thither with modesty enough, and  likelihood to lead it; as thus. Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander  returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that  loam whereto he was converted might they not stop a beer-barrel?   Imperious Caesar, dead and turn’d to clay,   Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.   O, that that earth which kept the world in awe   Should patch a wall t’expel the winter’s flaw.   But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King.         Enter  priests, &amp;c,  in procession; the corpse  of  Ophelia, Laertes  and  Mourners  following;  King,  Queen,  their Trains, &amp;c.        The Queen, the courtiers. Who is that they follow?   And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken   The corse they follow did with desperate hand   Fordo it own life. ’Twas of some estate.   Couch we awhile and mark.         \n",
      "That is Laertes, a very noble youth. Mark.\n",
      "What, the fair Ophelia?\n",
      "[ Advancing. ]   What is he whose grief   Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow   Conjures the wand’ring stars, and makes them stand   Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,   Hamlet the Dane.   [ Leaps into the grave. ]\n",
      "Thou pray’st not well.   I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;   For though I am not splenative and rash,   Yet have I in me something dangerous,   Which let thy wiseness fear. Away thy hand!\n",
      "Why, I will fight with him upon this theme   Until my eyelids will no longer wag.\n",
      "I lov’d Ophelia; forty thousand brothers   Could not, with all their quantity of love,   Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?\n",
      "’Swounds, show me what thou’lt do:   Woul’t weep? woul’t fight? woul’t fast? woul’t tear thyself?   Woul’t drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?   I’ll do’t. Dost thou come here to whine?   To outface me with leaping in her grave?   Be buried quick with her, and so will I.   And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw   Millions of acres on us, till our ground,   Singeing his pate against the burning zone,   Make Ossa like a wart. Nay, an thou’lt mouth,   I’ll rant as well as thou.\n",
      "Hear you, sir;   What is the reason that you use me thus?   I lov’d you ever. But it is no matter.   Let Hercules himself do what he may,   The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.         \n",
      "So much for this, sir. Now let me see the other;   You do remember all the circumstance?\n",
      "Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting   That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay   Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly,   And prais’d be rashness for it,—let us know,   Our indiscretion sometime serves us well,   When our deep plots do pall; and that should teach us   There’s a divinity that shapes our ends,   Rough-hew them how we will.\n",
      "Up from my cabin,   My sea-gown scarf’d about me, in the dark   Grop’d I to find out them; had my desire,   Finger’d their packet, and in fine, withdrew   To mine own room again, making so bold,   My fears forgetting manners, to unseal   Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,   Oh royal knavery! an exact command,   Larded with many several sorts of reasons,   Importing Denmark’s health, and England’s too,   With ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,   That on the supervise, no leisure bated,   No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,   My head should be struck off.\n",
      "Here’s the commission, read it at more leisure.   But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?\n",
      "Being thus benetted round with villanies,—   Or I could make a prologue to my brains,   They had begun the play,—I sat me down,   Devis’d a new commission, wrote it fair:   I once did hold it, as our statists do,   A baseness to write fair, and labour’d much   How to forget that learning; but, sir, now   It did me yeoman’s service. Wilt thou know   The effect of what I wrote?\n",
      "An earnest conjuration from the King,   As England was his faithful tributary,   As love between them like the palm might flourish,   As peace should still her wheaten garland wear   And stand a comma ’tween their amities,   And many such-like ‘as’es of great charge,   That on the view and know of these contents,   Without debatement further, more or less,   He should the bearers put to sudden death,   Not shriving-time allow’d.\n",
      "Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.   I had my father’s signet in my purse,   Which was the model of that Danish seal:   Folded the writ up in the form of the other,   Subscrib’d it: gave’t th’impression; plac’d it safely,   The changeling never known. Now, the next day   Was our sea-fight, and what to this was sequent   Thou know’st already.\n",
      "Why, man, they did make love to this employment.   They are not near my conscience; their defeat   Does by their own insinuation grow.   ’Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes   Between the pass and fell incensed points   Of mighty opposites.\n",
      "Does it not, thinks’t thee, stand me now upon,—   He that hath kill’d my king, and whor’d my mother,   Popp’d in between th’election and my hopes,   Thrown out his angle for my proper life,   And with such cozenage—is’t not perfect conscience   To quit him with this arm? And is’t not to be damn’d   To let this canker of our nature come   In further evil?\n",
      "It will be short. The interim is mine;   And a man’s life’s no more than to say ‘One’.   But I am very sorry, good Horatio,   That to Laertes I forgot myself;   For by the image of my cause I see   The portraiture of his. I’ll court his favours.   But sure the bravery of his grief did put me   Into a tow’ring passion.\n",
      "I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this waterfly?\n",
      "Thy state is the more gracious; for ’tis a vice to know him. He hath much land,  and fertile; let a beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the  king’s mess; ’tis a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.\n",
      "I will receive it with all diligence of spirit. Put your bonnet to his right  use; ’tis for the head.\n",
      "No, believe me, ’tis very cold, the wind is northerly.\n",
      "Methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.\n",
      "I beseech you, remember,—        \n",
      "Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you, though I know, to divide him  inventorially would dizzy th’arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw neither, in  respect of his quick sail. But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a  soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make  true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him  his umbrage, nothing more.\n",
      "The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath?\n",
      "What imports the nomination of this gentleman?\n",
      "Of him, sir.\n",
      "I would you did, sir; yet in faith if you did, it would not much approve me.  Well, sir?\n",
      "I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in excellence; but to  know a man well were to know himself.\n",
      "What’s his weapon?\n",
      "That’s two of his weapons. But well.\n",
      "What call you the carriages?\n",
      "The phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry cannon by our  sides. I would it might be hangers till then. But on. Six Barbary horses  against six French swords, their assigns, and three liberal conceited  carriages: that’s the French bet against the Danish. Why is this all imponed,  as you call it?\n",
      "How if I answer no?\n",
      "Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty, it is the  breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be brought, the gentleman willing,  and the King hold his purpose, I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain  nothing but my shame and the odd hits.\n",
      "To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.\n",
      "Yours, yours.                 He does well to commend it himself, there are no tongues else for’s turn.\n",
      "He did comply with his dug before he suck’d it. Thus has he,—and many more of  the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on,— only got the tune of the  time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of yeasty collection, which carries  them through and through the most fanned and winnowed opinions; and do but blow  them to their trial, the bubbles are out.        Enter a  Lord .\n",
      "I am constant to my purposes, they follow the King’s pleasure. If his fitness  speaks, mine is ready. Now or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.\n",
      "In happy time.\n",
      "She well instructs me.         \n",
      "I do not think so. Since he went into France, I have been in continual  practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all’s  here about my heart: but it is no matter.\n",
      "It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving as would perhaps  trouble a woman.\n",
      "Not a whit, we defy augury. There’s a special providence in the fall of a  sparrow. If it be now, ’tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now;  if it be not now, yet it will come. The readiness is all. Since no man has  aught of what he leaves, what is’t to leave betimes?        Enter  King, Queen, Laertes, Lords, Osric  and   Attendants  with foils &amp;c.\n",
      "Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;   But pardon’t as you are a gentleman.   This presence knows, and you must needs have heard,   How I am punish’d with sore distraction.   What I have done   That might your nature, honour, and exception   Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.   Was’t Hamlet wrong’d Laertes? Never Hamlet.   If Hamlet from himself be ta’en away,   And when he’s not himself does wrong Laertes,   Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.   Who does it, then? His madness. If’t be so,   Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong’d;   His madness is poor Hamlet’s enemy.   Sir, in this audience,   Let my disclaiming from a purpos’d evil   Free me so far in your most generous thoughts   That I have shot my arrow o’er the house   And hurt my brother.\n",
      "I embrace it freely,   And will this brother’s wager frankly play.—   Give us the foils; come on.\n",
      "I’ll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance   Your skill shall like a star i’ th’ darkest night,   Stick fiery off indeed.\n",
      "No, by this hand.\n",
      "Very well, my lord.   Your Grace has laid the odds o’ the weaker side.\n",
      "This likes me well. These foils have all a length?         \n",

      "I dare not drink yet, madam. By and by.\n",
      "Come for the third, Laertes. You do but dally.   I pray you pass with your best violence.   I am afeard you make a wanton of me.\n",
      "Nay, come again!         \n",
      "How does the Queen?\n",

And all for nothing!   For Hecuba?   What’s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,   That he should weep for her? What would he do,   Had he the motive and the cue for passion   That I have? He would drown the stage with tears   And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;   Make mad the guilty, and appal the free,   Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed,   The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,   A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak   Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,   And can say nothing. No, not for a king   Upon whose property and most dear life   A damn’d defeat was made. Am I a coward?   Who calls me villain, breaks my pate across?   Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?

For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak   With most miraculous organ. I’ll have these players   Play something like the murder of my father   Before mine uncle. I’ll observe his looks;   I’ll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,   I know my course. The spirit that I have seen   May be the devil, and the devil hath power   T’assume a pleasing shape, yea, and perhaps   Out of my weakness and my melancholy,   As he is very potent with such spirits,   Abuses me to damn me.
