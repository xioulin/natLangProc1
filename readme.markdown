This project is my introduction to natural language processing, nltk, and computational linguistics in general.

Most of what I do is based off what I've been practicing from the NLTK [book](https://www.nltk.org/book/).


I've been working with Moby Dick, Ivanhoe, the US presidential inaugural addresses, The Sun Also Rises by Hemingway,
and I've been dabbling with chatterbot.

I've basically hit a wall in terms of working through tutorials or doing stuff on my own. Right now, I'd like to
take some graduate classes in NLP, machine learning, and basically get a graduate certificate in NLP technology.
I also need to take a class in linear algebra, brush up on data structures and algorithms as well as on stats and probability.
I took a linguistics course years ago so I will also review some of that.

If I were to turn any of this into academic research, I would probably focus on morphology and with particular focus
on Moby Dick and the linguistic peculiarities of morphology in that epic novel.

I would also like to build some chatbots, mostly for my own personal amusement.

Basically, I put probably hundreds of hours of work into this and I'm reaching a point where I have to take more classes
and actually figure out how these ML tools work, not just practically but the theory as well.
