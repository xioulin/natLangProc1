Nevertheless it is clear that such persons as the writer of  these notes not only may, but positively must, exist in our society,  when we consider the circumstances in the midst of which our society is  formed. I have tried to expose to the view of the public more  distinctly than is commonly done, one of the characters of the recent  past. He is one of the representatives of a generation still living. In  this fragment, entitled 0cUnderground,0d this person introduces himself  and his views, and, as it were, tries to explain the causes owing to  which he has made his appearance and was bound to make his appearance  in our midst. In the second fragment there are added the actual notes  of this person concerning certain events in his life.04AUTHOR09S NOTE.          PART I  Underground          I      I am a sick man.... I am a spiteful man. I am an unattractive man. I  believe my liver is diseased. However, I know nothing at all about my  disease, and do not know for certain what ails me. I don09t consult a  doctor for it, and never have, though I have a respect for medicine and  doctors. Besides, I am extremely superstitious, sufficiently so to  respect medicine, anyway (I am well-educated enough not to be  superstitious, but I am superstitious). No, I refuse to consult a  doctor from spite. That you probably will not understand. Well, I  understand it, though. Of course, I can09t explain who it is precisely  that I am mortifying in this case by my spite: I am perfectly well  aware that I cannot 0cpay out0d the doctors by not consulting them; I  know better than anyone that by all this I am only injuring myself and  no one else. But still, if I don09t consult a doctor it is from spite.  My liver is bad, well04let it get worse!    I have been going on like that for a long time04twenty years. Now I am  forty. I used to be in the government service, but am no longer. I was  a spiteful official. I was rude and took pleasure in being so. I did  not take bribes, you see, so I was bound to find a recompense in that,  at least. (A poor jest, but I will not scratch it out. I wrote it  thinking it would sound very witty; but now that I have seen myself  that I only wanted to show off in a despicable way, I will not scratch  it out on purpose!)    When petitioners used to come for information to the table at which I  sat, I used to grind my teeth at them, and felt intense enjoyment when  I succeeded in making anybody unhappy. I almost did succeed. For the  most part they were all timid people04of course, they were petitioners.  But of the uppish ones there was one officer in particular I could not  endure. He simply would not be humble, and clanked his sword in a  disgusting way. I carried on a feud with him for eighteen months over  that sword. At last I got the better of him. He left off clanking it.  That happened in my youth, though.    But do you know, gentlemen, what was the chief point about my spite?  Why, the whole point, the real sting of it lay in the fact that  continually, even in the moment of the acutest spleen, I was inwardly  conscious with shame that I was not only not a spiteful but not even an  embittered man, that I was simply scaring sparrows at random and  amusing myself by it. I might foam at the mouth, but bring me a doll to  play with, give me a cup of tea with sugar in it, and maybe I should be  appeased. I might even be genuinely touched, though probably I should  grind my teeth at myself afterwards and lie awake at night with shame  for months after. That was my way.    I was lying when I said just now that I was a spiteful official. I was  lying from spite. I was simply amusing myself with the petitioners and  with the officer, and in reality I never could become spiteful. I was  conscious every moment in myself of many, very many elements absolutely  opposite to that. I felt them positively swarming in me, these opposite  elements. I knew that they had been swarming in me all my life and  craving some outlet from me, but I would not let them, would not let  them, purposely would not let them come out. They tormented me till I  was ashamed: they drove me to convulsions and04sickened me, at last, how  they sickened me! Now, are not you fancying, gentlemen, that I am  expressing remorse for something now, that I am asking your forgiveness  for something? I am sure you are fancying that ... However, I assure  you I do not care if you are....    It was not only that I could not become spiteful, I did not know how to  become anything; neither spiteful nor kind, neither a rascal nor an  honest man, neither a hero nor an insect. Now, I am living out my life  in my corner, taunting myself with the spiteful and useless consolation  that an intelligent man cannot become anything seriously, and it is  only the fool who becomes anything. Yes, a man in the nineteenth  century must and morally ought to be pre-eminently a characterless  creature; a man of character, an active man is pre-eminently a limited  creature. That is my conviction of forty years. I am forty years old  now, and you know forty years is a whole lifetime; you know it is  extreme old age. To live longer than forty years is bad manners, is  vulgar, immoral. Who does live beyond forty? Answer that, sincerely and  honestly I will tell you who do: fools and worthless fellows. I tell  all old men that to their face, all these venerable old men, all these  silver-haired and reverend seniors! I tell the whole world that to its  face! I have a right to say so, for I shall go on living to sixty  myself. To seventy! To eighty! ... Stay, let me take breath ...    You imagine no doubt, gentlemen, that I want to amuse you. You are  mistaken in that, too. I am by no means such a mirthful person as you  imagine, or as you may imagine; however, irritated by all this babble  (and I feel that you are irritated) you think fit to ask me who I  am04then my answer is, I am a collegiate assessor. I was in the service  that I might have something to eat (and solely for that reason), and  when last year a distant relation left me six thousand roubles in his  will I immediately retired from the service and settled down in my  corner. I used to live in this corner before, but now I have settled  down in it. My room is a wretched, horrid one in the outskirts of the  town. My servant is an old country-woman, ill-natured from stupidity,  and, moreover, there is always a nasty smell about her. I am told that  the Petersburg climate is bad for me, and that with my small means it  is very expensive to live in Petersburg. I know all that better than  all these sage and experienced counsellors and monitors.... But I am  remaining in Petersburg; I am not going away from Petersburg! I am not  going away because ... ech! Why, it is absolutely no matter whether I  am going away or not going away.    But what can a decent man speak of with most pleasure?    Answer: Of himself.    Well, so I will talk about myself.          II      I want now to tell you, gentlemen, whether you care to hear it or not,  why I could not even become an insect. I tell you solemnly, that I have  many times tried to become an insect. But I was not equal even to that.  I swear, gentlemen, that to be too conscious is an illness04a real  thorough-going illness. For man09s everyday needs, it would have been  quite enough to have the ordinary human consciousness, that is, half or  a quarter of the amount which falls to the lot of a cultivated man of  our unhappy nineteenth century, especially one who has the fatal  ill-luck to inhabit Petersburg, the most theoretical and intentional  town on the whole terrestrial globe. (There are intentional and  unintentional towns.) It would have been quite enough, for instance, to  have the consciousness by which all so-called direct persons and men of  action live. I bet you think I am writing all this from affectation, to  be witty at the expense of men of action; and what is more, that from  ill-bred affectation, I am clanking a sword like my officer. But,  gentlemen, whoever can pride himself on his diseases and even swagger  over them?    Though, after all, everyone does do that; people do pride themselves on  their diseases, and I do, may be, more than anyone. We will not dispute  it; my contention was absurd. But yet I am firmly persuaded that a  great deal of consciousness, every sort of consciousness, in fact, is a  disease. I stick to that. Let us leave that, too, for a minute. Tell me  this: why does it happen that at the very, yes, at the very moments  when I am most capable of feeling every refinement of all that is  0csublime and beautiful,0d as they used to say at one time, it would, as  though of design, happen to me not only to feel but to do such ugly  things, such that ... Well, in short, actions that all, perhaps,  commit; but which, as though purposely, occurred to me at the very time  when I was most conscious that they ought not to be committed. The more  conscious I was of goodness and of all that was 0csublime and  beautiful,0d the more deeply I sank into my mire and the more ready I  was to sink in it altogether. But the chief point was that all this  was, as it were, not accidental in me, but as though it were bound to  be so. It was as though it were my most normal condition, and not in  the least disease or depravity, so that at last all desire in me to  struggle against this depravity passed. It ended by my almost believing  (perhaps actually believing) that this was perhaps my normal condition.  But at first, in the beginning, what agonies I endured in that  struggle! I did not believe it was the same with other people, and all  my life I hid this fact about myself as a secret. I was ashamed (even  now, perhaps, I am ashamed): I got to the point of feeling a sort of  secret abnormal, despicable enjoyment in returning home to my corner on  some disgusting Petersburg night, acutely conscious that that day I had  committed a loathsome action again, that what was done could never be  undone, and secretly, inwardly gnawing, gnawing at myself for it,  tearing and consuming myself till at last the bitterness turned into a  sort of shameful accursed sweetness, and at last04into positive real  enjoyment! Yes, into enjoyment, into enjoyment! I insist upon that. I  have spoken of this because I keep wanting to know for a fact whether  other people feel such enjoyment? I will explain; the enjoyment was  just from the too intense consciousness of one09s own degradation; it  was from feeling oneself that one had reached the last barrier, that it  was horrible, but that it could not be otherwise; that there was no  escape for you; that you never could become a different man; that even  if time and faith were still left you to change into something  different you would most likely not wish to change; or if you did wish  to, even then you would do nothing; because perhaps in reality there  was nothing for you to change into.    And the worst of it was, and the root of it all, that it was all in  accord with the normal fundamental laws of over-acute consciousness,  and with the inertia that was the direct result of those laws, and that  consequently one was not only unable to change but could do absolutely  nothing. Thus it would follow, as the result of acute consciousness,  that one is not to blame in being a scoundrel; as though that were any  consolation to the scoundrel once he has come to realise that he  actually is a scoundrel. But enough.... Ech, I have talked a lot of  nonsense, but what have I explained? How is enjoyment in this to be  explained? But I will explain it. I will get to the bottom of it! That  is why I have taken up my pen....    I, for instance, have a great deal of _amour propre_. I am as  suspicious and prone to take offence as a humpback or a dwarf. But upon  my word I sometimes have had moments when if I had happened to be  slapped in the face I should, perhaps, have been positively glad of it.  I say, in earnest, that I should probably have been able to discover  even in that a peculiar sort of enjoyment04the enjoyment, of course, of  despair; but in despair there are the most intense enjoyments,  especially when one is very acutely conscious of the hopelessness of  one09s position. And when one is slapped in the face04why then the  consciousness of being rubbed into a pulp would positively overwhelm  one. The worst of it is, look at it which way one will, it still turns  out that I was always the most to blame in everything. And what is most  humiliating of all, to blame for no fault of my own but, so to say,  through the laws of nature. In the first place, to blame because I am  cleverer than any of the people surrounding me. (I have always  considered myself cleverer than any of the people surrounding me, and  sometimes, would you believe it, have been positively ashamed of it. At  any rate, I have all my life, as it were, turned my eyes away and never  could look people straight in the face.) To blame, finally, because  even if I had had magnanimity, I should only have had more suffering  from the sense of its uselessness. I should certainly have never been  able to do anything from being magnanimous04neither to forgive, for my  assailant would perhaps have slapped me from the laws of nature, and  one cannot forgive the laws of nature; nor to forget, for even if it  were owing to the laws of nature, it is insulting all the same.  Finally, even if I had wanted to be anything but magnanimous, had  desired on the contrary to revenge myself on my assailant, I could not  have revenged myself on any one for anything because I should certainly  never have made up my mind to do anything, even if I had been able to.  Why should I not have made up my mind? About that in particular I want  to say a few words.          III      With people who know how to revenge themselves and to stand up for  themselves in general, how is it done? Why, when they are possessed,  let us suppose, by the feeling of revenge, then for the time there is  nothing else but that feeling left in their whole being. Such a  gentleman simply dashes straight for his object like an infuriated bull  with its horns down, and nothing but a wall will stop him. (By the way:  facing the wall, such gentlemen04that is, the 0cdirect0d persons and men  of action04are genuinely nonplussed. For them a wall is not an evasion,  as for us people who think and consequently do nothing; it is not an  excuse for turning aside, an excuse for which we are always very glad,  though we scarcely believe in it ourselves, as a rule. No, they are  nonplussed in all sincerity. The wall has for them something  tranquillising, morally soothing, final04maybe even something mysterious  ... but of the wall later.)    Well, such a direct person I regard as the real normal man, as his  tender mother nature wished to see him when she graciously brought him  into being on the earth. I envy such a man till I am green in the face.  He is stupid. I am not disputing that, but perhaps the normal man  should be stupid, how do you know? Perhaps it is very beautiful, in  fact. And I am the more persuaded of that suspicion, if one can call it  so, by the fact that if you take, for instance, the antithesis of the  normal man, that is, the man of acute consciousness, who has come, of  course, not out of the lap of nature but out of a retort (this is  almost mysticism, gentlemen, but I suspect this, too), this retort-made  man is sometimes so nonplussed in the presence of his antithesis that  with all his exaggerated consciousness he genuinely thinks of himself  as a mouse and not a man. It may be an acutely conscious mouse, yet it  is a mouse, while the other is a man, and therefore, et caetera, et  caetera. And the worst of it is, he himself, his very own self, looks  on himself as a mouse; no one asks him to do so; and that is an  important point. Now let us look at this mouse in action. Let us  suppose, for instance, that it feels insulted, too (and it almost  always does feel insulted), and wants to revenge itself, too. There may  even be a greater accumulation of spite in it than in _l09homme de la  nature et de la vrit_. The base and nasty desire to vent that spite  on its assailant rankles perhaps even more nastily in it than in  _l09homme de la nature et de la vrit_. For through his innate  stupidity the latter looks upon his revenge as justice pure and simple;  while in consequence of his acute consciousness the mouse does not  believe in the justice of it. To come at last to the deed itself, to  the very act of revenge. Apart from the one fundamental nastiness the  luckless mouse succeeds in creating around it so many other nastinesses  in the form of doubts and questions, adds to the one question so many  unsettled questions that there inevitably works up around it a sort of  fatal brew, a stinking mess, made up of its doubts, emotions, and of  the contempt spat upon it by the direct men of action who stand  solemnly about it as judges and arbitrators, laughing at it till their  healthy sides ache. Of course the only thing left for it is to dismiss  all that with a wave of its paw, and, with a smile of assumed contempt  in which it does not even itself believe, creep ignominiously into its  mouse-hole. There in its nasty, stinking, underground home our  insulted, crushed and ridiculed mouse promptly becomes absorbed in  cold, malignant and, above all, everlasting spite. For forty years  together it will remember its injury down to the smallest, most  ignominious details, and every time will add, of itself, details still  more ignominious, spitefully teasing and tormenting itself with its own  imagination. It will itself be ashamed of its imaginings, but yet it  will recall it all, it will go over and over every detail, it will  invent unheard of things against itself, pretending that those things  might happen, and will forgive nothing. Maybe it will begin to revenge  itself, too, but, as it were, piecemeal, in trivial ways, from behind  the stove, incognito, without believing either in its own right to  vengeance, or in the success of its revenge, knowing that from all its  efforts at revenge it will suffer a hundred times more than he on whom  it revenges itself, while he, I daresay, will not even scratch himself.  On its deathbed it will recall it all over again, with interest  accumulated over all the years and ...    But it is just in that cold, abominable half despair, half belief, in  that conscious burying oneself alive for grief in the underworld for  forty years, in that acutely recognised and yet partly doubtful  hopelessness of one09s position, in that hell of unsatisfied desires  turned inward, in that fever of oscillations, of resolutions determined  for ever and repented of again a minute later04that the savour of that  strange enjoyment of which I have spoken lies. It is so subtle, so  difficult of analysis, that persons who are a little limited, or even  simply persons of strong nerves, will not understand a single atom of  it. 0cPossibly,0d you will add on your own account with a grin, 0cpeople  will not understand it either who have never received a slap in the  face,0d and in that way you will politely hint to me that I, too,  perhaps, have had the experience of a slap in the face in my life, and  so I speak as one who knows. I bet that you are thinking that. But set  your minds at rest, gentlemen, I have not received a slap in the face,  though it is absolutely a matter of indifference to me what you may  think about it. Possibly, I even regret, myself, that I have given so  few slaps in the face during my life. But enough ... not another word  on that subject of such extreme interest to you.    I will continue calmly concerning persons with strong nerves who do not  understand a certain refinement of enjoyment. Though in certain  circumstances these gentlemen bellow their loudest like bulls, though  this, let us suppose, does them the greatest credit, yet, as I have  said already, confronted with the impossible they subside at once. The  impossible means the stone wall! What stone wall? Why, of course, the  laws of nature, the deductions of natural science, mathematics. As soon  as they prove to you, for instance, that you are descended from a  monkey, then it is no use scowling, accept it for a fact. When they  prove to you that in reality one drop of your own fat must be dearer to  you than a hundred thousand of your fellow-creatures, and that this  conclusion is the final solution of all so-called virtues and duties  and all such prejudices and fancies, then you have just to accept it,  there is no help for it, for twice two is a law of mathematics. Just  try refuting it.    0cUpon my word, they will shout at you, it is no use protesting: it is a  case of twice two makes four! Nature does not ask your permission, she  has nothing to do with your wishes, and whether you like her laws or  dislike them, you are bound to accept her as she is, and consequently  all her conclusions. A wall, you see, is a wall ... and so on, and so  on.0d    Merciful Heavens! but what do I care for the laws of nature and  arithmetic, when, for some reason I dislike those laws and the fact  that twice two makes four? Of course I cannot break through the wall by  battering my head against it if I really have not the strength to knock  it down, but I am not going to be reconciled to it simply because it is  a stone wall and I have not the strength.    As though such a stone wall really were a consolation, and really did  contain some word of conciliation, simply because it is as true as  twice two makes four. Oh, absurdity of absurdities! How much better it  is to understand it all, to recognise it all, all the impossibilities  and the stone wall; not to be reconciled to one of those  impossibilities and stone walls if it disgusts you to be reconciled to  it; by the way of the most inevitable, logical combinations to reach  the most revolting conclusions on the everlasting theme, that even for  the stone wall you are yourself somehow to blame, though again it is as  clear as day you are not to blame in the least, and therefore grinding  your teeth in silent impotence to sink into luxurious inertia, brooding  on the fact that there is no one even for you to feel vindictive  against, that you have not, and perhaps never will have, an object for  your spite, that it is a sleight of hand, a bit of juggling, a  card-sharper09s trick, that it is simply a mess, no knowing what and no  knowing who, but in spite of all these uncertainties and jugglings,  still there is an ache in you, and the more you do not know, the worse  the ache.          IV      0cHa, ha, ha! You will be finding enjoyment in toothache next,0d you cry,  with a laugh.    0cWell, even in toothache there is enjoyment,0d I answer. I had toothache  for a whole month and I know there is. In that case, of course, people  are not spiteful in silence, but moan; but they are not candid moans,  they are malignant moans, and the malignancy is the whole point. The  enjoyment of the sufferer finds expression in those moans; if he did  not feel enjoyment in them he would not moan. It is a good example,  gentlemen, and I will develop it. Those moans express in the first  place all the aimlessness of your pain, which is so humiliating to your  consciousness; the whole legal system of nature on which you spit  disdainfully, of course, but from which you suffer all the same while  she does not. They express the consciousness that you have no enemy to  punish, but that you have pain; the consciousness that in spite of all  possible Wagenheims you are in complete slavery to your teeth; that if  someone wishes it, your teeth will leave off aching, and if he does  not, they will go on aching another three months; and that finally if  you are still contumacious and still protest, all that is left you for  your own gratification is to thrash yourself or beat your wall with  your fist as hard as you can, and absolutely nothing more. Well, these  mortal insults, these jeers on the part of someone unknown, end at last  in an enjoyment which sometimes reaches the highest degree of  voluptuousness. I ask you, gentlemen, listen sometimes to the moans of  an educated man of the nineteenth century suffering from toothache, on  the second or third day of the attack, when he is beginning to moan,  not as he moaned on the first day, that is, not simply because he has  toothache, not just as any coarse peasant, but as a man affected by  progress and European civilisation, a man who is 0cdivorced from the  soil and the national elements,0d as they express it now-a-days. His  moans become nasty, disgustingly malignant, and go on for whole days  and nights. And of course he knows himself that he is doing himself no  sort of good with his moans; he knows better than anyone that he is  only lacerating and harassing himself and others for nothing; he knows  that even the audience before whom he is making his efforts, and his  whole family, listen to him with loathing, do not put a ha09porth of  faith in him, and inwardly understand that he might moan differently,  more simply, without trills and flourishes, and that he is only amusing  himself like that from ill-humour, from malignancy. Well, in all these  recognitions and disgraces it is that there lies a voluptuous pleasure.  As though he would say: 0cI am worrying you, I am lacerating your  hearts, I am keeping everyone in the house awake. Well, stay awake  then, you, too, feel every minute that I have toothache. I am not a  hero to you now, as I tried to seem before, but simply a nasty person,  an impostor. Well, so be it, then! I am very glad that you see through  me. It is nasty for you to hear my despicable moans: well, let it be  nasty; here I will let you have a nastier flourish in a minute....0d You  do not understand even now, gentlemen? No, it seems our development and  our consciousness must go further to understand all the intricacies of  this pleasure. You laugh? Delighted. My jests, gentlemen, are of course  in bad taste, jerky, involved, lacking self-confidence. But of course  that is because I do not respect myself. Can a man of perception  respect himself at all?          V      Come, can a man who attempts to find enjoyment in the very feeling of  his own degradation possibly have a spark of respect for himself? I am  not saying this now from any mawkish kind of remorse. And, indeed, I  could never endure saying, 0cForgive me, Papa, I won09t do it again,0d not  because I am incapable of saying that04on the contrary, perhaps just  because I have been too capable of it, and in what a way, too. As  though of design I used to get into trouble in cases when I was not to  blame in any way. That was the nastiest part of it. At the same time I  was genuinely touched and penitent, I used to shed tears and, of  course, deceived myself, though I was not acting in the least and there  was a sick feeling in my heart at the time.... For that one could not  blame even the laws of nature, though the laws of nature have  continually all my life offended me more than anything. It is loathsome  to remember it all, but it was loathsome even then. Of course, a minute  or so later I would realise wrathfully that it was all a lie, a  revolting lie, an affected lie, that is, all this penitence, this  emotion, these vows of reform. You will ask why did I worry myself with  such antics: answer, because it was very dull to sit with one09s hands  folded, and so one began cutting capers. That is really it. Observe  yourselves more carefully, gentlemen, then you will understand that it  is so. I invented adventures for myself and made up a life, so as at  least to live in some way. How many times it has happened to me04well,  for instance, to take offence simply on purpose, for nothing; and one  knows oneself, of course, that one is offended at nothing; that one is  putting it on, but yet one brings oneself at last to the point of being  really offended. All my life I have had an impulse to play such pranks,  so that in the end I could not control it in myself. Another time,  twice, in fact, I tried hard to be in love. I suffered, too, gentlemen,  I assure you. In the depth of my heart there was no faith in my  suffering, only a faint stir of mockery, but yet I did suffer, and in  the real, orthodox way; I was jealous, beside myself ... and it was all  from _ennui_, gentlemen, all from _ennui;_ inertia overcame me. You  know the direct, legitimate fruit of consciousness is inertia, that is,  conscious sitting-with-the-hands-folded. I have referred to this  already. I repeat, I repeat with emphasis: all 0cdirect0d persons and men  of action are active just because they are stupid and limited. How  explain that? I will tell you: in consequence of their limitation they  take immediate and secondary causes for primary ones, and in that way  persuade themselves more quickly and easily than other people do that  they have found an infallible foundation for their activity, and their  minds are at ease and you know that is the chief thing. To begin to  act, you know, you must first have your mind completely at ease and no  trace of doubt left in it. Why, how am I, for example, to set my mind  at rest? Where are the primary causes on which I am to build? Where are  my foundations? Where am I to get them from? I exercise myself in  reflection, and consequently with me every primary cause at once draws  after itself another still more primary, and so on to infinity. That is  just the essence of every sort of consciousness and reflection. It must  be a case of the laws of nature again. What is the result of it in the  end? Why, just the same. Remember I spoke just now of vengeance. (I am  sure you did not take it in.) I said that a man revenges himself  because he sees justice in it. Therefore he has found a primary cause,  that is, justice. And so he is at rest on all sides, and consequently  he carries out his revenge calmly and successfully, being persuaded  that he is doing a just and honest thing. But I see no justice in it, I  find no sort of virtue in it either, and consequently if I attempt to  revenge myself, it is only out of spite. Spite, of course, might  overcome everything, all my doubts, and so might serve quite  successfully in place of a primary cause, precisely because it is not a  cause. But what is to be done if I have not even spite (I began with  that just now, you know). In consequence again of those accursed laws  of consciousness, anger in me is subject to chemical disintegration.  You look into it, the object flies off into air, your reasons  evaporate, the criminal is not to be found, the wrong becomes not a  wrong but a phantom, something like the toothache, for which no one is  to blame, and consequently there is only the same outlet left  again04that is, to beat the wall as hard as you can. So you give it up  with a wave of the hand because you have not found a fundamental cause.  And try letting yourself be carried away by your feelings, blindly,  without reflection, without a primary cause, repelling consciousness at  least for a time; hate or love, if only not to sit with your hands  folded. The day after tomorrow, at the latest, you will begin despising  yourself for having knowingly deceived yourself. Result: a soap-bubble  and inertia. Oh, gentlemen, do you know, perhaps I consider myself an  intelligent man, only because all my life I have been able neither to  begin nor to finish anything. Granted I am a babbler, a harmless  vexatious babbler, like all of us. But what is to be done if the direct  and sole vocation of every intelligent man is babble, that is, the  intentional pouring of water through a sieve?          VI      Oh, if I had done nothing simply from laziness! Heavens, how I should  have respected myself, then. I should have respected myself because I  should at least have been capable of being lazy; there would at least  have been one quality, as it were, positive in me, in which I could  have believed myself. Question: What is he? Answer: A sluggard; how  very pleasant it would have been to hear that of oneself! It would mean  that I was positively defined, it would mean that there was something  to say about me. 0cSluggard0d04why, it is a calling and vocation, it is a  career. Do not jest, it is so. I should then be a member of the best  club by right, and should find my occupation in continually respecting  myself. I knew a gentleman who prided himself all his life on being a  connoisseur of Lafitte. He considered this as his positive virtue, and  never doubted himself. He died, not simply with a tranquil, but with a  triumphant conscience, and he was quite right, too. Then I should have  chosen a career for myself, I should have been a sluggard and a  glutton, not a simple one, but, for instance, one with sympathies for  everything sublime and beautiful. How do you like that? I have long had  visions of it. That 0csublime and beautiful0d weighs heavily on my mind  at forty But that is at forty; then04oh, then it would have been  different! I should have found for myself a form of activity in keeping  with it, to be precise, drinking to the health of everything 0csublime  and beautiful.0d I should have snatched at every opportunity to drop a  tear into my glass and then to drain it to all that is 0csublime and  beautiful.0d I should then have turned everything into the sublime and  the beautiful; in the nastiest, unquestionable trash, I should have  sought out the sublime and the beautiful. I should have exuded tears  like a wet sponge. An artist, for instance, paints a picture worthy of  Gay. At once I drink to the health of the artist who painted the  picture worthy of Gay, because I love all that is 0csublime and  beautiful.0d An author has written _As you will:_ at once I drink to the  health of 0canyone you will0d because I love all that is 0csublime and  beautiful.0d    I should claim respect for doing so. I should persecute anyone who  would not show me respect. I should live at ease, I should die with  dignity, why, it is charming, perfectly charming! And what a good round  belly I should have grown, what a treble chin I should have  established, what a ruby nose I should have coloured for myself, so  that everyone would have said, looking at me: 0cHere is an asset! Here  is something real and solid!0d And, say what you like, it is very  agreeable to hear such remarks about oneself in this negative age.          VII      But these are all golden dreams. Oh, tell me, who was it first  announced, who was it first proclaimed, that man only does nasty things  because he does not know his own interests; and that if he were  enlightened, if his eyes were opened to his real normal interests, man  would at once cease to do nasty things, would at once become good and  noble because, being enlightened and understanding his real advantage,  he would see his own advantage in the good and nothing else, and we all  know that not one man can, consciously, act against his own interests,  consequently, so to say, through necessity, he would begin doing good?  Oh, the babe! Oh, the pure, innocent child! Why, in the first place,  when in all these thousands of years has there been a time when man has  acted only from his own interest? What is to be done with the millions  of facts that bear witness that men, _consciously_, that is fully  understanding their real interests, have left them in the background  and have rushed headlong on another path, to meet peril and danger,  compelled to this course by nobody and by nothing, but, as it were,  simply disliking the beaten track, and have obstinately, wilfully,  struck out another difficult, absurd way, seeking it almost in the  darkness. So, I suppose, this obstinacy and perversity were pleasanter  to them than any advantage.... Advantage! What is advantage? And will  you take it upon yourself to define with perfect accuracy in what the  advantage of man consists? And what if it so happens that a man09s  advantage, _sometimes_, not only may, but even must, consist in his  desiring in certain cases what is harmful to himself and not  advantageous. And if so, if there can be such a case, the whole  principle falls into dust. What do you think04are there such cases? You  laugh; laugh away, gentlemen, but only answer me: have man09s advantages  been reckoned up with perfect certainty? Are there not some which not  only have not been included but cannot possibly be included under any  classification? You see, you gentlemen have, to the best of my  knowledge, taken your whole register of human advantages from the  averages of statistical figures and politico-economical formulas. Your  advantages are prosperity, wealth, freedom, peace04and so on, and so on.  So that the man who should, for instance, go openly and knowingly in  opposition to all that list would to your thinking, and indeed mine,  too, of course, be an obscurantist or an absolute madman: would not he?  But, you know, this is what is surprising: why does it so happen that  all these statisticians, sages and lovers of humanity, when they reckon  up human advantages invariably leave out one? They don09t even take it  into their reckoning in the form in which it should be taken, and the  whole reckoning depends upon that. It would be no greater matter, they  would simply have to take it, this advantage, and add it to the list.  But the trouble is, that this strange advantage does not fall under any  classification and is not in place in any list. I have a friend for  instance ... Ech! gentlemen, but of course he is your friend, too; and  indeed there is no one, no one to whom he is not a friend! When he  prepares for any undertaking this gentleman immediately explains to  you, elegantly and clearly, exactly how he must act in accordance with  the laws of reason and truth. What is more, he will talk to you with  excitement and passion of the true normal interests of man; with irony  he will upbraid the short-sighted fools who do not understand their own  interests, nor the true significance of virtue; and, within a quarter  of an hour, without any sudden outside provocation, but simply through  something inside him which is stronger than all his interests, he will  go off on quite a different tack04that is, act in direct opposition to  what he has just been saying about himself, in opposition to the laws  of reason, in opposition to his own advantage, in fact in opposition to  everything ... I warn you that my friend is a compound personality and  therefore it is difficult to blame him as an individual. The fact is,  gentlemen, it seems there must really exist something that is dearer to  almost every man than his greatest advantages, or (not to be illogical)  there is a most advantageous advantage (the very one omitted of which  we spoke just now) which is more important and more advantageous than  all other advantages, for the sake of which a man if necessary is ready  to act in opposition to all laws; that is, in opposition to reason,  honour, peace, prosperity04in fact, in opposition to all those excellent  and useful things if only he can attain that fundamental, most  advantageous advantage which is dearer to him than all. 0cYes, but it09s  advantage all the same,0d you will retort. But excuse me, I09ll make the  point clear, and it is not a case of playing upon words. What matters  is, that this advantage is remarkable from the very fact that it breaks  down all our classifications, and continually shatters every system  constructed by lovers of mankind for the benefit of mankind. In fact,  it upsets everything. But before I mention this advantage to you, I  want to compromise myself personally, and therefore I boldly declare  that all these fine systems, all these theories for explaining to  mankind their real normal interests, in order that inevitably striving  to pursue these interests they may at once become good and noble04are,  in my opinion, so far, mere logical exercises! Yes, logical exercises.  Why, to maintain this theory of the regeneration of mankind by means of  the pursuit of his own advantage is to my mind almost the same thing  ... as to affirm, for instance, following Buckle, that through  civilisation mankind becomes softer, and consequently less bloodthirsty  and less fitted for warfare. Logically it does seem to follow from his  arguments. But man has such a predilection for systems and abstract  deductions that he is ready to distort the truth intentionally, he is  ready to deny the evidence of his senses only to justify his logic. I  take this example because it is the most glaring instance of it. Only  look about you: blood is being spilt in streams, and in the merriest  way, as though it were champagne. Take the whole of the nineteenth  century in which Buckle lived. Take Napoleon04the Great and also the  present one. Take North America04the eternal union. Take the farce of  Schleswig-Holstein.... And what is it that civilisation softens in us?  The only gain of civilisation for mankind is the greater capacity for  variety of sensations04and absolutely nothing more. And through the  development of this many-sidedness man may come to finding enjoyment in  bloodshed. In fact, this has already happened to him. Have you noticed  that it is the most civilised gentlemen who have been the subtlest  slaughterers, to whom the Attilas and Stenka Razins could not hold a  candle, and if they are not so conspicuous as the Attilas and Stenka  Razins it is simply because they are so often met with, are so ordinary  and have become so familiar to us. In any case civilisation has made  mankind if not more bloodthirsty, at least more vilely, more  loathsomely bloodthirsty. In old days he saw justice in bloodshed and  with his conscience at peace exterminated those he thought proper. Now  we do think bloodshed abominable and yet we engage in this abomination,  and with more energy than ever. Which is worse? Decide that for  yourselves. They say that Cleopatra (excuse an instance from Roman  history) was fond of sticking gold pins into her slave-girls09 breasts  and derived gratification from their screams and writhings. You will  say that that was in the comparatively barbarous times; that these are  barbarous times too, because also, comparatively speaking, pins are  stuck in even now; that though man has now learned to see more clearly  than in barbarous ages, he is still far from having learnt to act as  reason and science would dictate. But yet you are fully convinced that  he will be sure to learn when he gets rid of certain old bad habits,  and when common sense and science have completely re-educated human  nature and turned it in a normal direction. You are confident that then  man will cease from _intentional_ error and will, so to say, be  compelled not to want to set his will against his normal interests.  That is not all; then, you say, science itself will teach man (though  to my mind it09s a superfluous luxury) that he never has really had any  caprice or will of his own, and that he himself is something of the  nature of a piano-key or the stop of an organ, and that there are,  besides, things called the laws of nature; so that everything he does  is not done by his willing it, but is done of itself, by the laws of  nature. Consequently we have only to discover these laws of nature, and  man will no longer have to answer for his actions and life will become  exceedingly easy for him. All human actions will then, of course, be  tabulated according to these laws, mathematically, like tables of  logarithms up to 108,000, and entered in an index; or, better still,  there would be published certain edifying works of the nature of  encyclopaedic lexicons, in which everything will be so clearly  calculated and explained that there will be no more incidents or  adventures in the world.    Then04this is all what you say04new economic relations will be  established, all ready-made and worked out with mathematical  exactitude, so that every possible question will vanish in the  twinkling of an eye, simply because every possible answer to it will be  provided. Then the 0cPalace of Crystal0d will be built. Then ... In fact,  those will be halcyon days. Of course there is no guaranteeing (this is  my comment) that it will not be, for instance, frightfully dull then  (for what will one have to do when everything will be calculated and  tabulated), but on the other hand everything will be extraordinarily  rational. Of course boredom may lead you to anything. It is boredom  sets one sticking golden pins into people, but all that would not  matter. What is bad (this is my comment again) is that I dare say  people will be thankful for the gold pins then. Man is stupid, you  know, phenomenally stupid; or rather he is not at all stupid, but he is  so ungrateful that you could not find another like him in all creation.  I, for instance, would not be in the least surprised if all of a  sudden, _ propos_ of nothing, in the midst of general prosperity a  gentleman with an ignoble, or rather with a reactionary and ironical,  countenance were to arise and, putting his arms akimbo, say to us all:  0cI say, gentleman, hadn09t we better kick over the whole show and  scatter rationalism to the winds, simply to send these logarithms to  the devil, and to enable us to live once more at our own sweet foolish  will!0d That again would not matter, but what is annoying is that he  would be sure to find followers04such is the nature of man. And all that  for the most foolish reason, which, one would think, was hardly worth  mentioning: that is, that man everywhere and at all times, whoever he  may be, has preferred to act as he chose and not in the least as his  reason and advantage dictated. And one may choose what is contrary to  one09s own interests, and sometimes one _positively ought_ (that is my  idea). One09s own free unfettered choice, one09s own caprice, however  wild it may be, one09s own fancy worked up at times to frenzy04is that  very 0cmost advantageous advantage0d which we have overlooked, which  comes under no classification and against which all systems and  theories are continually being shattered to atoms. And how do these  wiseacres know that man wants a normal, a virtuous choice? What has  made them conceive that man must want a rationally advantageous choice?  What man wants is simply _independent_ choice, whatever that  independence may cost and wherever it may lead. And choice, of course,  the devil only knows what choice.          VIII      0cHa! ha! ha! But you know there is no such thing as choice in reality,  say what you like,0d you will interpose with a chuckle. 0cScience has  succeeded in so far analysing man that we know already that choice and  what is called freedom of will is nothing else than040d    Stay, gentlemen, I meant to begin with that myself I confess, I was  rather frightened. I was just going to say that the devil only knows  what choice depends on, and that perhaps that was a very good thing,  but I remembered the teaching of science ... and pulled myself up. And  here you have begun upon it. Indeed, if there really is some day  discovered a formula for all our desires and caprices04that is, an  explanation of what they depend upon, by what laws they arise, how they  develop, what they are aiming at in one case and in another and so on,  that is a real mathematical formula04then, most likely, man will at once  cease to feel desire, indeed, he will be certain to. For who would want  to choose by rule? Besides, he will at once be transformed from a human  being into an organ-stop or something of the sort; for what is a man  without desires, without free will and without choice, if not a stop in  an organ? What do you think? Let us reckon the chances04can such a thing  happen or not?    0cH09m!0d you decide. 0cOur choice is usually mistaken from a false view of  our advantage. We sometimes choose absolute nonsense because in our  foolishness we see in that nonsense the easiest means for attaining a  supposed advantage. But when all that is explained and worked out on  paper (which is perfectly possible, for it is contemptible and  senseless to suppose that some laws of nature man will never  understand), then certainly so-called desires will no longer exist. For  if a desire should come into conflict with reason we shall then reason  and not desire, because it will be impossible retaining our reason to  be _senseless_ in our desires, and in that way knowingly act against  reason and desire to injure ourselves. And as all choice and reasoning  can be really calculated04because there will some day be discovered the  laws of our so-called free will04so, joking apart, there may one day be  something like a table constructed of them, so that we really shall  choose in accordance with it. If, for instance, some day they calculate  and prove to me that I made a long nose at someone because I could not  help making a long nose at him and that I had to do it in that  particular way, what _freedom_ is left me, especially if I am a learned  man and have taken my degree somewhere? Then I should be able to  calculate my whole life for thirty years beforehand. In short, if this  could be arranged there would be nothing left for us to do; anyway, we  should have to understand that. And, in fact, we ought unwearyingly to  repeat to ourselves that at such and such a time and in such and such  circumstances nature does not ask our leave; that we have got to take  her as she is and not fashion her to suit our fancy, and if we really  aspire to formulas and tables of rules, and well, even ... to the  chemical retort, there09s no help for it, we must accept the retort too,  or else it will be accepted without our consent....0d    Yes, but here I come to a stop! Gentlemen, you must excuse me for being  over-philosophical; it09s the result of forty years underground! Allow  me to indulge my fancy. You see, gentlemen, reason is an excellent  thing, there09s no disputing that, but reason is nothing but reason and  satisfies only the rational side of man09s nature, while will is a  manifestation of the whole life, that is, of the whole human life  including reason and all the impulses. And although our life, in this  manifestation of it, is often worthless, yet it is life and not simply  extracting square roots. Here I, for instance, quite naturally want to  live, in order to satisfy all my capacities for life, and not simply my  capacity for reasoning, that is, not simply one twentieth of my  capacity for life. What does reason know? Reason only knows what it has  succeeded in learning (some things, perhaps, it will never learn; this  is a poor comfort, but why not say so frankly?) and human nature acts  as a whole, with everything that is in it, consciously or  unconsciously, and, even if it goes wrong, it lives. I suspect,  gentlemen, that you are looking at me with compassion; you tell me  again that an enlightened and developed man, such, in short, as the  future man will be, cannot consciously desire anything disadvantageous  to himself, that that can be proved mathematically. I thoroughly agree,  it can04by mathematics. But I repeat for the hundredth time, there is  one case, one only, when man may consciously, purposely, desire what is  injurious to himself, what is stupid, very stupid04simply in order to  have the right to desire for himself even what is very stupid and not  to be bound by an obligation to desire only what is sensible. Of  course, this very stupid thing, this caprice of ours, may be in  reality, gentlemen, more advantageous for us than anything else on  earth, especially in certain cases. And in particular it may be more  advantageous than any advantage even when it does us obvious harm, and  contradicts the soundest conclusions of our reason concerning our  advantage04for in any circumstances it preserves for us what is most  precious and most important04that is, our personality, our  individuality. Some, you see, maintain that this really is the most  precious thing for mankind; choice can, of course, if it chooses, be in  agreement with reason; and especially if this be not abused but kept  within bounds. It is profitable and sometimes even praiseworthy. But  very often, and even most often, choice is utterly and stubbornly  opposed to reason ... and ... and ... do you know that that, too, is  profitable, sometimes even praiseworthy? Gentlemen, let us suppose that  man is not stupid. (Indeed one cannot refuse to suppose that, if only  from the one consideration, that, if man is stupid, then who is wise?)  But if he is not stupid, he is monstrously ungrateful! Phenomenally  ungrateful. In fact, I believe that the best definition of man is the  ungrateful biped. But that is not all, that is not his worst defect;  his worst defect is his perpetual moral obliquity, perpetual04from the  days of the Flood to the Schleswig-Holstein period. Moral obliquity and  consequently lack of good sense; for it has long been accepted that  lack of good sense is due to no other cause than moral obliquity. Put  it to the test and cast your eyes upon the history of mankind. What  will you see? Is it a grand spectacle? Grand, if you like. Take the  Colossus of Rhodes, for instance, that09s worth something. With good  reason Mr. Anaevsky testifies of it that some say that it is the work  of man09s hands, while others maintain that it has been created by  nature herself. Is it many-coloured? May be it is many-coloured, too:  if one takes the dress uniforms, military and civilian, of all peoples  in all ages04that alone is worth something, and if you take the undress  uniforms you will never get to the end of it; no historian would be  equal to the job. Is it monotonous? May be it09s monotonous too: it09s  fighting and fighting; they are fighting now, they fought first and  they fought last04you will admit, that it is almost too monotonous. In  short, one may say anything about the history of the world04anything  that might enter the most disordered imagination. The only thing one  can09t say is that it09s rational. The very word sticks in one09s throat.  And, indeed, this is the odd thing that is continually happening: there  are continually turning up in life moral and rational persons, sages  and lovers of humanity who make it their object to live all their lives  as morally and rationally as possible, to be, so to speak, a light to  their neighbours simply in order to show them that it is possible to  live morally and rationally in this world. And yet we all know that  those very people sooner or later have been false to themselves,  playing some queer trick, often a most unseemly one. Now I ask you:  what can be expected of man since he is a being endowed with strange  qualities? Shower upon him every earthly blessing, drown him in a sea  of happiness, so that nothing but bubbles of bliss can be seen on the  surface; give him economic prosperity, such that he should have nothing  else to do but sleep, eat cakes and busy himself with the continuation  of his species, and even then out of sheer ingratitude, sheer spite,  man would play you some nasty trick. He would even risk his cakes and  would deliberately desire the most fatal rubbish, the most uneconomical  absurdity, simply to introduce into all this positive good sense his  fatal fantastic element. It is just his fantastic dreams, his vulgar  folly that he will desire to retain, simply in order to prove to  himself04as though that were so necessary04that men still are men and not  the keys of a piano, which the laws of nature threaten to control so  completely that soon one will be able to desire nothing but by the  calendar. And that is not all: even if man really were nothing but a  piano-key, even if this were proved to him by natural science and  mathematics, even then he would not become reasonable, but would  purposely do something perverse out of simple ingratitude, simply to  gain his point. And if he does not find means he will contrive  destruction and chaos, will contrive sufferings of all sorts, only to  gain his point! He will launch a curse upon the world, and as only man  can curse (it is his privilege, the primary distinction between him and  other animals), may be by his curse alone he will attain his  object04that is, convince himself that he is a man and not a piano-key!  If you say that all this, too, can be calculated and tabulated04chaos  and darkness and curses, so that the mere possibility of calculating it  all beforehand would stop it all, and reason would reassert itself,  then man would purposely go mad in order to be rid of reason and gain  his point! I believe in it, I answer for it, for the whole work of man  really seems to consist in nothing but proving to himself every minute  that he is a man and not a piano-key! It may be at the cost of his  skin, it may be by cannibalism! And this being so, can one help being  tempted to rejoice that it has not yet come off, and that desire still  depends on something we don09t know?    You will scream at me (that is, if you condescend to do so) that no one  is touching my free will, that all they are concerned with is that my  will should of itself, of its own free will, coincide with my own  normal interests, with the laws of nature and arithmetic.    Good heavens, gentlemen, what sort of free will is left when we come to  tabulation and arithmetic, when it will all be a case of twice two make  four? Twice two makes four without my will. As if free will meant that!          IX      Gentlemen, I am joking, and I know myself that my jokes are not  brilliant, but you know one can take everything as a joke. I am,  perhaps, jesting against the grain. Gentlemen, I am tormented by  questions; answer them for me. You, for instance, want to cure men of  their old habits and reform their will in accordance with science and  good sense. But how do you know, not only that it is possible, but also  that it is _desirable_ to reform man in that way? And what leads you to  the conclusion that man09s inclinations _need_ reforming? In short, how  do you know that such a reformation will be a benefit to man? And to go  to the root of the matter, why are you so positively convinced that not  to act against his real normal interests guaranteed by the conclusions  of reason and arithmetic is certainly always advantageous for man and  must always be a law for mankind? So far, you know, this is only your  supposition. It may be the law of logic, but not the law of humanity.  You think, gentlemen, perhaps that I am mad? Allow me to defend myself.  I agree that man is pre-eminently a creative animal, predestined to  strive consciously for an object and to engage in engineering04that is,  incessantly and eternally to make new roads, _wherever they may lead_.  But the reason why he wants sometimes to go off at a tangent may just  be that he is _predestined_ to make the road, and perhaps, too, that  however stupid the 0cdirect0d practical man may be, the thought sometimes  will occur to him that the road almost always does lead _somewhere_,  and that the destination it leads to is less important than the process  of making it, and that the chief thing is to save the well-conducted  child from despising engineering, and so giving way to the fatal  idleness, which, as we all know, is the mother of all the vices. Man  likes to make roads and to create, that is a fact beyond dispute. But  why has he such a passionate love for destruction and chaos also? Tell  me that! But on that point I want to say a couple of words myself. May  it not be that he loves chaos and destruction (there can be no  disputing that he does sometimes love it) because he is instinctively  afraid of attaining his object and completing the edifice he is  constructing? Who knows, perhaps he only loves that edifice from a  distance, and is by no means in love with it at close quarters; perhaps  he only loves building it and does not want to live in it, but will  leave it, when completed, for the use of _les animaux domestiques_04such  as the ants, the sheep, and so on. Now the ants have quite a different  taste. They have a marvellous edifice of that pattern which endures for  ever04the ant-heap.    With the ant-heap the respectable race of ants began and with the  ant-heap they will probably end, which does the greatest credit to  their perseverance and good sense. But man is a frivolous and  incongruous creature, and perhaps, like a chess player, loves the  process of the game, not the end of it. And who knows (there is no  saying with certainty), perhaps the only goal on earth to which mankind  is striving lies in this incessant process of attaining, in other  words, in life itself, and not in the thing to be attained, which must  always be expressed as a formula, as positive as twice two makes four,  and such positiveness is not life, gentlemen, but is the beginning of  death. Anyway, man has always been afraid of this mathematical  certainty, and I am afraid of it now. Granted that man does nothing but  seek that mathematical certainty, he traverses oceans, sacrifices his  life in the quest, but to succeed, really to find it, dreads, I assure  you. He feels that when he has found it there will be nothing for him  to look for. When workmen have finished their work they do at least  receive their pay, they go to the tavern, then they are taken to the  police-station04and there is occupation for a week. But where can man  go? Anyway, one can observe a certain awkwardness about him when he has  attained such objects. He loves the process of attaining, but does not  quite like to have attained, and that, of course, is very absurd. In  fact, man is a comical creature; there seems to be a kind of jest in it  all. But yet mathematical certainty is after all, something  insufferable. Twice two makes four seems to me simply a piece of  insolence. Twice two makes four is a pert coxcomb who stands with arms  akimbo barring your path and spitting. I admit that twice two makes  four is an excellent thing, but if we are to give everything its due,  twice two makes five is sometimes a very charming thing too.    And why are you so firmly, so triumphantly, convinced that only the  normal and the positive04in other words, only what is conducive to  welfare04is for the advantage of man? Is not reason in error as regards  advantage? Does not man, perhaps, love something besides well-being?  Perhaps he is just as fond of suffering? Perhaps suffering is just as  great a benefit to him as well-being? Man is sometimes extraordinarily,  passionately, in love with suffering, and that is a fact. There is no  need to appeal to universal history to prove that; only ask yourself,  if you are a man and have lived at all. As far as my personal opinion  is concerned, to care only for well-being seems to me positively  ill-bred. Whether it09s good or bad, it is sometimes very pleasant, too,  to smash things. I hold no brief for suffering nor for well-being  either. I am standing for ... my caprice, and for its being guaranteed  to me when necessary. Suffering would be out of place in vaudevilles,  for instance; I know that. In the 0cPalace of Crystal0d it is  unthinkable; suffering means doubt, negation, and what would be the  good of a 0cpalace of crystal0d if there could be any doubt about it? And  yet I think man will never renounce real suffering, that is,  destruction and chaos. Why, suffering is the sole origin of  consciousness. Though I did lay it down at the beginning that  consciousness is the greatest misfortune for man, yet I know man prizes  it and would not give it up for any satisfaction. Consciousness, for  instance, is infinitely superior to twice two makes four. Once you have  mathematical certainty there is nothing left to do or to understand.  There will be nothing left but to bottle up your five senses and plunge  into contemplation. While if you stick to consciousness, even though  the same result is attained, you can at least flog yourself at times,  and that will, at any rate, liven you up. Reactionary as it is,  corporal punishment is better than nothing.          X      You believe in a palace of crystal that can never be destroyed04a palace  at which one will not be able to put out one09s tongue or make a long  nose on the sly. And perhaps that is just why I am afraid of this  edifice, that it is of crystal and can never be destroyed and that one  cannot put one09s tongue out at it even on the sly.    You see, if it were not a palace, but a hen-house, I might creep into  it to avoid getting wet, and yet I would not call the hen-house a  palace out of gratitude to it for keeping me dry. You laugh and say  that in such circumstances a hen-house is as good as a mansion. Yes, I  answer, if one had to live simply to keep out of the rain.    But what is to be done if I have taken it into my head that that is not  the only object in life, and that if one must live one had better live  in a mansion? That is my choice, my desire. You will only eradicate it  when you have changed my preference. Well, do change it, allure me with  something else, give me another ideal. But meanwhile I will not take a  hen-house for a mansion. The palace of crystal may be an idle dream, it  may be that it is inconsistent with the laws of nature and that I have  invented it only through my own stupidity, through the old-fashioned  irrational habits of my generation. But what does it matter to me that  it is inconsistent? That makes no difference since it exists in my  desires, or rather exists as long as my desires exist. Perhaps you are  laughing again? Laugh away; I will put up with any mockery rather than  pretend that I am satisfied when I am hungry. I know, anyway, that I  will not be put off with a compromise, with a recurring zero, simply  because it is consistent with the laws of nature and actually exists. I  will not accept as the crown of my desires a block of buildings with  tenements for the poor on a lease of a thousand years, and perhaps with  a sign-board of a dentist hanging out. Destroy my desires, eradicate my  ideals, show me something better, and I will follow you. You will say,  perhaps, that it is not worth your trouble; but in that case I can give  you the same answer. We are discussing things seriously; but if you  won09t deign to give me your attention, I will drop your acquaintance. I  can retreat into my underground hole.    But while I am alive and have desires I would rather my hand were  withered off than bring one brick to such a building! Don09t remind me  that I have just rejected the palace of crystal for the sole reason  that one cannot put out one09s tongue at it. I did not say because I am  so fond of putting my tongue out. Perhaps the thing I resented was,  that of all your edifices there has not been one at which one could not  put out one09s tongue. On the contrary, I would let my tongue be cut off  out of gratitude if things could be so arranged that I should lose all  desire to put it out. It is not my fault that things cannot be so  arranged, and that one must be satisfied with model flats. Then why am  I made with such desires? Can I have been constructed simply in order  to come to the conclusion that all my construction is a cheat? Can this  be my whole purpose? I do not believe it.    But do you know what: I am convinced that we underground folk ought to  be kept on a curb. Though we may sit forty years underground without  speaking, when we do come out into the light of day and break out we  talk and talk and talk....          XI      The long and the short of it is, gentlemen, that it is better to do  nothing! Better conscious inertia! And so hurrah for underground!  Though I have said that I envy the normal man to the last drop of my  bile, yet I should not care to be in his place such as he is now  (though I shall not cease envying him). No, no; anyway the underground  life is more advantageous. There, at any rate, one can ... Oh, but even  now I am lying! I am lying because I know myself that it is not  underground that is better, but something different, quite different,  for which I am thirsting, but which I cannot find! Damn underground!    I will tell you another thing that would be better, and that is, if I  myself believed in anything of what I have just written. I swear to  you, gentlemen, there is not one thing, not one word of what I have  written that I really believe. That is, I believe it, perhaps, but at  the same time I feel and suspect that I am lying like a cobbler.    0cThen why have you written all this?0d you will say to me. 0cI ought to  put you underground for forty years without anything to do and then  come to you in your cellar, to find out what stage you have reached!  How can a man be left with nothing to do for forty years?0d    0cIsn09t that shameful, isn09t that humiliating?0d you will say, perhaps,  wagging your heads contemptuously. 0cYou thirst for life and try to  settle the problems of life by a logical tangle. And how persistent,  how insolent are your sallies, and at the same time what a scare you  are in! You talk nonsense and are pleased with it; you say impudent  things and are in continual alarm and apologising for them. You declare  that you are afraid of nothing and at the same time try to ingratiate  yourself in our good opinion. You declare that you are gnashing your  teeth and at the same time you try to be witty so as to amuse us. You  know that your witticisms are not witty, but you are evidently well  satisfied with their literary value. You may, perhaps, have really  suffered, but you have no respect for your own suffering. You may have  sincerity, but you have no modesty; out of the pettiest vanity you  expose your sincerity to publicity and ignominy. You doubtlessly mean  to say something, but hide your last word through fear, because you  have not the resolution to utter it, and only have a cowardly  impudence. You boast of consciousness, but you are not sure of your  ground, for though your mind works, yet your heart is darkened and  corrupt, and you cannot have a full, genuine consciousness without a  pure heart. And how intrusive you are, how you insist and grimace!  Lies, lies, lies!0d    Of course I have myself made up all the things you say. That, too, is  from underground. I have been for forty years listening to you through  a crack under the floor. I have invented them myself, there was nothing  else I could invent. It is no wonder that I have learned it by heart  and it has taken a literary form....    But can you really be so credulous as to think that I will print all  this and give it to you to read too? And another problem: why do I call  you 0cgentlemen,0d why do I address you as though you really were my  readers? Such confessions as I intend to make are never printed nor  given to other people to read. Anyway, I am not strong-minded enough  for that, and I don09t see why I should be. But you see a fancy has  occurred to me and I want to realise it at all costs. Let me explain.    Every man has reminiscences which he would not tell to everyone, but  only to his friends. He has other matters in his mind which he would  not reveal even to his friends, but only to himself, and that in  secret. But there are other things which a man is afraid to tell even  to himself, and every decent man has a number of such things stored  away in his mind. The more decent he is, the greater the number of such  things in his mind. Anyway, I have only lately determined to remember  some of my early adventures. Till now I have always avoided them, even  with a certain uneasiness. Now, when I am not only recalling them, but  have actually decided to write an account of them, I want to try the  experiment whether one can, even with oneself, be perfectly open and  not take fright at the whole truth. I will observe, in parenthesis,  that Heine says that a true autobiography is almost an impossibility,  and that man is bound to lie about himself. He considers that Rousseau  certainly told lies about himself in his confessions, and even  intentionally lied, out of vanity. I am convinced that Heine is right;  I quite understand how sometimes one may, out of sheer vanity,  attribute regular crimes to oneself, and indeed I can very well  conceive that kind of vanity. But Heine judged of people who made their  confessions to the public. I write only for myself, and I wish to  declare once and for all that if I write as though I were addressing  readers, that is simply because it is easier for me to write in that  form. It is a form, an empty form04I shall never have readers. I have  made this plain already ...    I don09t wish to be hampered by any restrictions in the compilation of  my notes. I shall not attempt any system or method. I will jot things  down as I remember them.    But here, perhaps, someone will catch at the word and ask me: if you  really don09t reckon on readers, why do you make such compacts with  yourself04and on paper too04that is, that you won09t attempt any system or  method, that you jot things down as you remember them, and so on, and  so on? Why are you explaining? Why do you apologise?    Well, there it is, I answer.    There is a whole psychology in all this, though. Perhaps it is simply  that I am a coward. And perhaps that I purposely imagine an audience  before me in order that I may be more dignified while I write. There  are perhaps thousands of reasons. Again, what is my object precisely in  writing? If it is not for the benefit of the public why should I not  simply recall these incidents in my own mind without putting them on  paper?    Quite so; but yet it is more imposing on paper. There is something more  impressive in it; I shall be better able to criticise myself and  improve my style. Besides, I shall perhaps obtain actual relief from  writing. Today, for instance, I am particularly oppressed by one memory  of a distant past. It came back vividly to my mind a few days ago, and  has remained haunting me like an annoying tune that one cannot get rid  of. And yet I must get rid of it somehow. I have hundreds of such  reminiscences; but at times some one stands out from the hundred and  oppresses me. For some reason I believe that if I write it down I  should get rid of it. Why not try?    Besides, I am bored, and I never have anything to do. Writing will be a  sort of work. They say work makes man kind-hearted and honest. Well,  here is a chance for me, anyway.    Snow is falling today, yellow and dingy. It fell yesterday, too, and a  few days ago. I fancy it is the wet snow that has reminded me of that  incident which I cannot shake off now. And so let it be a story _  propos_ of the falling snow.          PART II  0 Propos of the Wet Snow      When from dark error09s subjugation  My words of passionate exhortation      Had wrenched thy fainting spirit free;  And writhing prone in thine affliction  Thou didst recall with malediction      The vice that had encompassed thee:  And when thy slumbering conscience, fretting      By recollection09s torturing flame,  Thou didst reveal the hideous setting      Of thy life09s current ere I came:  When suddenly I saw thee sicken,      And weeping, hide thine anguished face,  Revolted, maddened, horror-stricken,      At memories of foul disgrace.                      NEKRASSOV (_translated by Juliet Soskice_).          I      At that time I was only twenty-four. My life was even then gloomy,  ill-regulated, and as solitary as that of a savage. I made friends with  no one and positively avoided talking, and buried myself more and more  in my hole. At work in the office I never looked at anyone, and was  perfectly well aware that my companions looked upon me, not only as a  queer fellow, but even looked upon me04I always fancied this04with a sort  of loathing. I sometimes wondered why it was that nobody except me  fancied that he was looked upon with aversion? One of the clerks had a  most repulsive, pock-marked face, which looked positively villainous. I  believe I should not have dared to look at anyone with such an  unsightly countenance. Another had such a very dirty old uniform that  there was an unpleasant odour in his proximity. Yet not one of these  gentlemen showed the slightest self-consciousness04either about their  clothes or their countenance or their character in any way. Neither of  them ever imagined that they were looked at with repulsion; if they had  imagined it they would not have minded04so long as their superiors did  not look at them in that way. It is clear to me now that, owing to my  unbounded vanity and to the high standard I set for myself, I often  looked at myself with furious discontent, which verged on loathing, and  so I inwardly attributed the same feeling to everyone. I hated my face,  for instance: I thought it disgusting, and even suspected that there  was something base in my expression, and so every day when I turned up  at the office I tried to behave as independently as possible, and to  assume a lofty expression, so that I might not be suspected of being  abject. 0cMy face may be ugly,0d I thought, 0cbut let it be lofty,  expressive, and, above all, _extremely_ intelligent.0d But I was  positively and painfully certain that it was impossible for my  countenance ever to express those qualities. And what was worst of all,  I thought it actually stupid looking, and I would have been quite  satisfied if I could have looked intelligent. In fact, I would even  have put up with looking base if, at the same time, my face could have  been thought strikingly intelligent.    Of course, I hated my fellow clerks one and all, and I despised them  all, yet at the same time I was, as it were, afraid of them. In fact,  it happened at times that I thought more highly of them than of myself.  It somehow happened quite suddenly that I alternated between despising  them and thinking them superior to myself. A cultivated and decent man  cannot be vain without setting a fearfully high standard for himself,  and without despising and almost hating himself at certain moments. But  whether I despised them or thought them superior I dropped my eyes  almost every time I met anyone. I even made experiments whether I could  face so and so09s looking at me, and I was always the first to drop my  eyes. This worried me to distraction. I had a sickly dread, too, of  being ridiculous, and so had a slavish passion for the conventional in  everything external. I loved to fall into the common rut, and had a  whole-hearted terror of any kind of eccentricity in myself. But how  could I live up to it? I was morbidly sensitive as a man of our age  should be. They were all stupid, and as like one another as so many  sheep. Perhaps I was the only one in the office who fancied that I was  a coward and a slave, and I fancied it just because I was more highly  developed. But it was not only that I fancied it, it really was so. I  was a coward and a slave. I say this without the slightest  embarrassment. Every decent man of our age must be a coward and a  slave. That is his normal condition. Of that I am firmly persuaded. He  is made and constructed to that very end. And not only at the present  time owing to some casual circumstances, but always, at all times, a  decent man is bound to be a coward and a slave. It is the law of nature  for all decent people all over the earth. If anyone of them happens to  be valiant about something, he need not be comforted nor carried away  by that; he would show the white feather just the same before something  else. That is how it invariably and inevitably ends. Only donkeys and  mules are valiant, and they only till they are pushed up to the wall.  It is not worth while to pay attention to them for they really are of  no consequence.    Another circumstance, too, worried me in those days: that there was no  one like me and I was unlike anyone else. 0cI am alone and they are  _everyone_,0d I thought04and pondered.    From that it is evident that I was still a youngster.    The very opposite sometimes happened. It was loathsome sometimes to go  to the office; things reached such a point that I often came home ill.  But all at once, _ propos_ of nothing, there would come a phase of  scepticism and indifference (everything happened in phases to me), and  I would laugh myself at my intolerance and fastidiousness, I would  reproach myself with being _romantic_. At one time I was unwilling to  speak to anyone, while at other times I would not only talk, but go to  the length of contemplating making friends with them. All my  fastidiousness would suddenly, for no rhyme or reason, vanish. Who  knows, perhaps I never had really had it, and it had simply been  affected, and got out of books. I have not decided that question even  now. Once I quite made friends with them, visited their homes, played  preference, drank vodka, talked of promotions.... But here let me make  a digression.    We Russians, speaking generally, have never had those foolish  transcendental 0cromantics0d04German, and still more French04on whom  nothing produces any effect; if there were an earthquake, if all France  perished at the barricades, they would still be the same, they would  not even have the decency to affect a change, but would still go on  singing their transcendental songs to the hour of their death, because  they are fools. We, in Russia, have no fools; that is well known. That  is what distinguishes us from foreign lands. Consequently these  transcendental natures are not found amongst us in their pure form. The  idea that they are is due to our 0crealistic0d journalists and critics of  that day, always on the look out for Kostanzhoglos and Uncle Pyotr  Ivanitchs and foolishly accepting them as our ideal; they have  slandered our romantics, taking them for the same transcendental sort  as in Germany or France. On the contrary, the characteristics of our  0cromantics0d are absolutely and directly opposed to the transcendental  European type, and no European standard can be applied to them. (Allow  me to make use of this word 0cromantic0d04an old-fashioned and much  respected word which has done good service and is familiar to all.) The  characteristics of our romantic are to understand everything, _to see  everything and to see it often incomparably more clearly than our most  realistic minds see it;_ to refuse to accept anyone or anything, but at  the same time not to despise anything; to give way, to yield, from  policy; never to lose sight of a useful practical object (such as  rent-free quarters at the government expense, pensions, decorations),  to keep their eye on that object through all the enthusiasms and  volumes of lyrical poems, and at the same time to preserve 0cthe sublime  and the beautiful0d inviolate within them to the hour of their death,  and to preserve themselves also, incidentally, like some precious jewel  wrapped in cotton wool if only for the benefit of 0cthe sublime and the  beautiful.0d Our 0cromantic0d is a man of great breadth and the greatest  rogue of all our rogues, I assure you.... I can assure you from  experience, indeed. Of course, that is, if he is intelligent. But what  am I saying! The romantic is always intelligent, and I only meant to  observe that although we have had foolish romantics they don09t count,  and they were only so because in the flower of their youth they  degenerated into Germans, and to preserve their precious jewel more  comfortably, settled somewhere out there04by preference in Weimar or the  Black Forest.    I, for instance, genuinely despised my official work and did not openly  abuse it simply because I was in it myself and got a salary for it.  Anyway, take note, I did not openly abuse it. Our romantic would rather  go out of his mind04a thing, however, which very rarely happens04than  take to open abuse, unless he had some other career in view; and he is  never kicked out. At most, they would take him to the lunatic asylum as  0cthe King of Spain0d if he should go very mad. But it is only the thin,  fair people who go out of their minds in Russia. Innumerable  0cromantics0d attain later in life to considerable rank in the service.  Their many-sidedness is remarkable! And what a faculty they have for  the most contradictory sensations! I was comforted by this thought even  in those days, and I am of the same opinion now. That is why there are  so many 0cbroad natures0d among us who never lose their ideal even in the  depths of degradation; and though they never stir a finger for their  ideal, though they are arrant thieves and knaves, yet they tearfully  cherish their first ideal and are extraordinarily honest at heart. Yes,  it is only among us that the most incorrigible rogue can be absolutely  and loftily honest at heart without in the least ceasing to be a rogue.  I repeat, our romantics, frequently, become such accomplished rascals  (I use the term 0crascals0d affectionately), suddenly display such a  sense of reality and practical knowledge that their bewildered  superiors and the public generally can only ejaculate in amazement.    Their many-sidedness is really amazing, and goodness knows what it may  develop into later on, and what the future has in store for us. It is  not a poor material! I do not say this from any foolish or boastful  patriotism. But I feel sure that you are again imagining that I am  joking. Or perhaps it09s just the contrary and you are convinced that I  really think so. Anyway, gentlemen, I shall welcome both views as an  honour and a special favour. And do forgive my digression.    I did not, of course, maintain friendly relations with my comrades and  soon was at loggerheads with them, and in my youth and inexperience I  even gave up bowing to them, as though I had cut off all relations.  That, however, only happened to me once. As a rule, I was always alone.    In the first place I spent most of my time at home, reading. I tried to  stifle all that was continually seething within me by means of external  impressions. And the only external means I had was reading. Reading, of  course, was a great help04exciting me, giving me pleasure and pain. But  at times it bored me fearfully. One longed for movement in spite of  everything, and I plunged all at once into dark, underground, loathsome  vice of the pettiest kind. My wretched passions were acute, smarting,  from my continual, sickly irritability I had hysterical impulses, with  tears and convulsions. I had no resource except reading, that is, there  was nothing in my surroundings which I could respect and which  attracted me. I was overwhelmed with depression, too; I had an  hysterical craving for incongruity and for contrast, and so I took to  vice. I have not said all this to justify myself.... But, no! I am  lying. I did want to justify myself. I make that little observation for  my own benefit, gentlemen. I don09t want to lie. I vowed to myself I  would not.    And so, furtively, timidly, in solitude, at night, I indulged in filthy  vice, with a feeling of shame which never deserted me, even at the most  loathsome moments, and which at such moments nearly made me curse.  Already even then I had my underground world in my soul. I was  fearfully afraid of being seen, of being met, of being recognised. I  visited various obscure haunts.    One night as I was passing a tavern I saw through a lighted window some  gentlemen fighting with billiard cues, and saw one of them thrown out  of the window. At other times I should have felt very much disgusted,  but I was in such a mood at the time, that I actually envied the  gentleman thrown out of the window04and I envied him so much that I even  went into the tavern and into the billiard-room. 0cPerhaps,0d I thought,  0cI09ll have a fight, too, and they09ll throw me out of the window.0d    I was not drunk04but what is one to do04depression will drive a man to  such a pitch of hysteria? But nothing happened. It seemed that I was  not even equal to being thrown out of the window and I went away  without having my fight.    An officer put me in my place from the first moment.    I was standing by the billiard-table and in my ignorance blocking up  the way, and he wanted to pass; he took me by the shoulders and without  a word04without a warning or explanation04moved me from where I was  standing to another spot and passed by as though he had not noticed me.  I could have forgiven blows, but I could not forgive his having moved  me without noticing me.    Devil knows what I would have given for a real regular quarrel04a more  decent, a more _literary_ one, so to speak. I had been treated like a  fly. This officer was over six foot, while I was a spindly little  fellow. But the quarrel was in my hands. I had only to protest and I  certainly would have been thrown out of the window. But I changed my  mind and preferred to beat a resentful retreat.    I went out of the tavern straight home, confused and troubled, and the  next night I went out again with the same lewd intentions, still more  furtively, abjectly and miserably than before, as it were, with tears  in my eyes04but still I did go out again. Don09t imagine, though, it was  cowardice made me slink away from the officer; I never have been a  coward at heart, though I have always been a coward in action. Don09t be  in a hurry to laugh04I assure you I can explain it all.    Oh, if only that officer had been one of the sort who would consent to  fight a duel! But no, he was one of those gentlemen (alas, long  extinct!) who preferred fighting with cues or, like Gogol09s Lieutenant  Pirogov, appealing to the police. They did not fight duels and would  have thought a duel with a civilian like me an utterly unseemly  procedure in any case04and they looked upon the duel altogether as  something impossible, something free-thinking and French. But they were  quite ready to bully, especially when they were over six foot.    I did not slink away through cowardice, but through an unbounded  vanity. I was afraid not of his six foot, not of getting a sound  thrashing and being thrown out of the window; I should have had  physical courage enough, I assure you; but I had not the moral courage.  What I was afraid of was that everyone present, from the insolent  marker down to the lowest little stinking, pimply clerk in a greasy  collar, would jeer at me and fail to understand when I began to protest  and to address them in literary language. For of the point of  honour04not of honour, but of the point of honour (_point  d09honneur_)04one cannot speak among us except in literary language. You  can09t allude to the 0cpoint of honour0d in ordinary language. I was fully  convinced (the sense of reality, in spite of all my romanticism!) that  they would all simply split their sides with laughter, and that the  officer would not simply beat me, that is, without insulting me, but  would certainly prod me in the back with his knee, kick me round the  billiard-table, and only then perhaps have pity and drop me out of the  window.    Of course, this trivial incident could not with me end in that. I often  met that officer afterwards in the street and noticed him very  carefully. I am not quite sure whether he recognised me, I imagine not;  I judge from certain signs. But I04I stared at him with spite and hatred  and so it went on ... for several years! My resentment grew even deeper  with years. At first I began making stealthy inquiries about this  officer. It was difficult for me to do so, for I knew no one. But one  day I heard someone shout his surname in the street as I was following  him at a distance, as though I were tied to him04and so I learnt his  surname. Another time I followed him to his flat, and for ten kopecks  learned from the porter where he lived, on which storey, whether he  lived alone or with others, and so on04in fact, everything one could  learn from a porter. One morning, though I had never tried my hand with  the pen, it suddenly occurred to me to write a satire on this officer  in the form of a novel which would unmask his villainy. I wrote the  novel with relish. I did unmask his villainy, I even exaggerated it; at  first I so altered his surname that it could easily be recognised, but  on second thoughts I changed it, and sent the story to the  _Otetchestvenniya Zapiski_. But at that time such attacks were not the  fashion and my story was not printed. That was a great vexation to me.    Sometimes I was positively choked with resentment. At last I determined  to challenge my enemy to a duel. I composed a splendid, charming letter  to him, imploring him to apologise to me, and hinting rather plainly at  a duel in case of refusal. The letter was so composed that if the  officer had had the least understanding of the sublime and the  beautiful he would certainly have flung himself on my neck and have  offered me his friendship. And how fine that would have been! How we  should have got on together! 0cHe could have shielded me with his higher  rank, while I could have improved his mind with my culture, and, well  ... my ideas, and all sorts of things might have happened.0d Only fancy,  this was two years after his insult to me, and my challenge would have  been a ridiculous anachronism, in spite of all the ingenuity of my  letter in disguising and explaining away the anachronism. But, thank  God (to this day I thank the Almighty with tears in my eyes) I did not  send the letter to him. Cold shivers run down my back when I think of  what might have happened if I had sent it.    And all at once I revenged myself in the simplest way, by a stroke of  genius! A brilliant thought suddenly dawned upon me. Sometimes on  holidays I used to stroll along the sunny side of the Nevsky about four  o09clock in the afternoon. Though it was hardly a stroll so much as a  series of innumerable miseries, humiliations and resentments; but no  doubt that was just what I wanted. I used to wriggle along in a most  unseemly fashion, like an eel, continually moving aside to make way for  generals, for officers of the guards and the hussars, or for ladies. At  such minutes there used to be a convulsive twinge at my heart, and I  used to feel hot all down my back at the mere thought of the  wretchedness of my attire, of the wretchedness and abjectness of my  little scurrying figure. This was a regular martyrdom, a continual,  intolerable humiliation at the thought, which passed into an incessant  and direct sensation, that I was a mere fly in the eyes of all this  world, a nasty, disgusting fly04more intelligent, more highly developed,  more refined in feeling than any of them, of course04but a fly that was  continually making way for everyone, insulted and injured by everyone.  Why I inflicted this torture upon myself, why I went to the Nevsky, I  don09t know. I felt simply drawn there at every possible opportunity.    Already then I began to experience a rush of the enjoyment of which I  spoke in the first chapter. After my affair with the officer I felt  even more drawn there than before: it was on the Nevsky that I met him  most frequently, there I could admire him. He, too, went there chiefly  on holidays, He, too, turned out of his path for generals and persons  of high rank, and he too, wriggled between them like an eel; but  people, like me, or even better dressed than me, he simply walked over;  he made straight for them as though there was nothing but empty space  before him, and never, under any circumstances, turned aside. I gloated  over my resentment watching him and ... always resentfully made way for  him. It exasperated me that even in the street I could not be on an  even footing with him.    0cWhy must you invariably be the first to move aside?0d I kept asking  myself in hysterical rage, waking up sometimes at three o09clock in the  morning. 0cWhy is it you and not he? There09s no regulation about it;  there09s no written law. Let the making way be equal as it usually is  when refined people meet; he moves half-way and you move half-way; you  pass with mutual respect.0d    But that never happened, and I always moved aside, while he did not  even notice my making way for him. And lo and behold a bright idea  dawned upon me! 0cWhat,0d I thought, 0cif I meet him and don09t move on one  side? What if I don09t move aside on purpose, even if I knock up against  him? How would that be?0d This audacious idea took such a hold on me  that it gave me no peace. I was dreaming of it continually, horribly,  and I purposely went more frequently to the Nevsky in order to picture  more vividly how I should do it when I did do it. I was delighted. This  intention seemed to me more and more practical and possible.    0cOf course I shall not really push him,0d I thought, already more  good-natured in my joy. 0cI will simply not turn aside, will run up  against him, not very violently, but just shouldering each other04just  as much as decency permits. I will push against him just as much as he  pushes against me.0d At last I made up my mind completely. But my  preparations took a great deal of time. To begin with, when I carried  out my plan I should need to be looking rather more decent, and so I  had to think of my get-up. 0cIn case of emergency, if, for instance,  there were any sort of public scandal (and the public there is of the  most _recherch:_ the Countess walks there; Prince D. walks there; all  the literary world is there), I must be well dressed; that inspires  respect and of itself puts us on an equal footing in the eyes of the  society.0d    With this object I asked for some of my salary in advance, and bought  at Tchurkin09s a pair of black gloves and a decent hat. Black gloves  seemed to me both more dignified and _bon ton_ than the lemon-coloured  ones which I had contemplated at first. 0cThe colour is too gaudy, it  looks as though one were trying to be conspicuous,0d and I did not take  the lemon-coloured ones. I had got ready long beforehand a good shirt,  with white bone studs; my overcoat was the only thing that held me  back. The coat in itself was a very good one, it kept me warm; but it  was wadded and it had a raccoon collar which was the height of  vulgarity. I had to change the collar at any sacrifice, and to have a  beaver one like an officer09s. For this purpose I began visiting the  Gostiny Dvor and after several attempts I pitched upon a piece of cheap  German beaver. Though these German beavers soon grow shabby and look  wretched, yet at first they look exceedingly well, and I only needed it  for the occasion. I asked the price; even so, it was too expensive.  After thinking it over thoroughly I decided to sell my raccoon collar.  The rest of the money04a considerable sum for me, I decided to borrow  from Anton Antonitch Syetotchkin, my immediate superior, an unassuming  person, though grave and judicious. He never lent money to anyone, but  I had, on entering the service, been specially recommended to him by an  important personage who had got me my berth. I was horribly worried. To  borrow from Anton Antonitch seemed to me monstrous and shameful. I did  not sleep for two or three nights. Indeed, I did not sleep well at that  time, I was in a fever; I had a vague sinking at my heart or else a  sudden throbbing, throbbing, throbbing! Anton Antonitch was surprised  at first, then he frowned, then he reflected, and did after all lend me  the money, receiving from me a written authorisation to take from my  salary a fortnight later the sum that he had lent me.    In this way everything was at last ready. The handsome beaver replaced  the mean-looking raccoon, and I began by degrees to get to work. It  would never have done to act offhand, at random; the plan had to be  carried out skilfully, by degrees. But I must confess that after many  efforts I began to despair: we simply could not run into each other. I  made every preparation, I was quite determined04it seemed as though we  should run into one another directly04and before I knew what I was doing  I had stepped aside for him again and he had passed without noticing  me. I even prayed as I approached him that God would grant me  determination. One time I had made up my mind thoroughly, but it ended  in my stumbling and falling at his feet because at the very last  instant when I was six inches from him my courage failed me. He very  calmly stepped over me, while I flew on one side like a ball. That  night I was ill again, feverish and delirious.    And suddenly it ended most happily. The night before I had made up my  mind not to carry out my fatal plan and to abandon it all, and with  that object I went to the Nevsky for the last time, just to see how I  would abandon it all. Suddenly, three paces from my enemy, I  unexpectedly made up my mind04I closed my eyes, and we ran full tilt,  shoulder to shoulder, against one another! I did not budge an inch and  passed him on a perfectly equal footing! He did not even look round and  pretended not to notice it; but he was only pretending, I am convinced  of that. I am convinced of that to this day! Of course, I got the worst  of it04he was stronger, but that was not the point. The point was that I  had attained my object, I had kept up my dignity, I had not yielded a  step, and had put myself publicly on an equal social footing with him.  I returned home feeling that I was fully avenged for everything. I was  delighted. I was triumphant and sang Italian arias. Of course, I will  not describe to you what happened to me three days later; if you have  read my first chapter you can guess for yourself. The officer was  afterwards transferred; I have not seen him now for fourteen years.  What is the dear fellow doing now? Whom is he walking over?          II      But the period of my dissipation would end and I always felt very sick  afterwards. It was followed by remorse04I tried to drive it away; I felt  too sick. By degrees, however, I grew used to that too. I grew used to  everything, or rather I voluntarily resigned myself to enduring it. But  I had a means of escape that reconciled everything04that was to find  refuge in 0cthe sublime and the beautiful,0d in dreams, of course. I was  a terrible dreamer, I would dream for three months on end, tucked away  in my corner, and you may believe me that at those moments I had no  resemblance to the gentleman who, in the perturbation of his chicken  heart, put a collar of German beaver on his great-coat. I suddenly  became a hero. I would not have admitted my six-foot lieutenant even if  he had called on me. I could not even picture him before me then. What  were my dreams and how I could satisfy myself with them04it is hard to  say now, but at the time I was satisfied with them. Though, indeed,  even now, I am to some extent satisfied with them. Dreams were  particularly sweet and vivid after a spell of dissipation; they came  with remorse and with tears, with curses and transports. There were  moments of such positive intoxication, of such happiness, that there  was not the faintest trace of irony within me, on my honour. I had  faith, hope, love. I believed blindly at such times that by some  miracle, by some external circumstance, all this would suddenly open  out, expand; that suddenly a vista of suitable activity04beneficent,  good, and, above all, _ready made_ (what sort of activity I had no  idea, but the great thing was that it should be all ready for me)04would  rise up before me04and I should come out into the light of day, almost  riding a white horse and crowned with laurel. Anything but the foremost  place I could not conceive for myself, and for that very reason I quite  contentedly occupied the lowest in reality. Either to be a hero or to  grovel in the mud04there was nothing between. That was my ruin, for when  I was in the mud I comforted myself with the thought that at other  times I was a hero, and the hero was a cloak for the mud: for an  ordinary man it was shameful to defile himself, but a hero was too  lofty to be utterly defiled, and so he might defile himself. It is  worth noting that these attacks of the 0csublime and the beautiful0d  visited me even during the period of dissipation and just at the times  when I was touching the bottom. They came in separate spurts, as though  reminding me of themselves, but did not banish the dissipation by their  appearance. On the contrary, they seemed to add a zest to it by  contrast, and were only sufficiently present to serve as an appetising  sauce. That sauce was made up of contradictions and sufferings, of  agonising inward analysis, and all these pangs and pin-pricks gave a  certain piquancy, even a significance to my dissipation04in fact,  completely answered the purpose of an appetising sauce. There was a  certain depth of meaning in it. And I could hardly have resigned myself  to the simple, vulgar, direct debauchery of a clerk and have endured  all the filthiness of it. What could have allured me about it then and  have drawn me at night into the street? No, I had a lofty way of  getting out of it all.    And what loving-kindness, oh Lord, what loving-kindness I felt at times  in those dreams of mine! in those 0cflights into the sublime and the  beautiful0d; though it was fantastic love, though it was never applied  to anything human in reality, yet there was so much of this love that  one did not feel afterwards even the impulse to apply it in reality;  that would have been superfluous. Everything, however, passed  satisfactorily by a lazy and fascinating transition into the sphere of  art, that is, into the beautiful forms of life, lying ready, largely  stolen from the poets and novelists and adapted to all sorts of needs  and uses. I, for instance, was triumphant over everyone; everyone, of  course, was in dust and ashes, and was forced spontaneously to  recognise my superiority, and I forgave them all. I was a poet and a  grand gentleman, I fell in love; I came in for countless millions and  immediately devoted them to humanity, and at the same time I confessed  before all the people my shameful deeds, which, of course, were not  merely shameful, but had in them much that was 0csublime and beautiful0d  something in the Manfred style. Everyone would kiss me and weep (what  idiots they would be if they did not), while I should go barefoot and  hungry preaching new ideas and fighting a victorious Austerlitz against  the obscurantists. Then the band would play a march, an amnesty would  be declared, the Pope would agree to retire from Rome to Brazil; then  there would be a ball for the whole of Italy at the Villa Borghese on  the shores of Lake Como, Lake Como being for that purpose transferred  to the neighbourhood of Rome; then would come a scene in the bushes,  and so on, and so on04as though you did not know all about it? You will  say that it is vulgar and contemptible to drag all this into public  after all the tears and transports which I have myself confessed. But  why is it contemptible? Can you imagine that I am ashamed of it all,  and that it was stupider than anything in your life, gentlemen? And I  can assure you that some of these fancies were by no means badly  composed.... It did not all happen on the shores of Lake Como. And yet  you are right04it really is vulgar and contemptible. And most  contemptible of all it is that now I am attempting to justify myself to  you. And even more contemptible than that is my making this remark now.  But that09s enough, or there will be no end to it; each step will be  more contemptible than the last....    I could never stand more than three months of dreaming at a time  without feeling an irresistible desire to plunge into society. To  plunge into society meant to visit my superior at the office, Anton  Antonitch Syetotchkin. He was the only permanent acquaintance I have  had in my life, and I wonder at the fact myself now. But I only went to  see him when that phase came over me, and when my dreams had reached  such a point of bliss that it became essential at once to embrace my  fellows and all mankind; and for that purpose I needed, at least, one  human being, actually existing. I had to call on Anton Antonitch,  however, on Tuesday04his at-home day; so I had always to time my  passionate desire to embrace humanity so that it might fall on a  Tuesday.    This Anton Antonitch lived on the fourth storey in a house in Five  Corners, in four low-pitched rooms, one smaller than the other, of a  particularly frugal and sallow appearance. He had two daughters and  their aunt, who used to pour out the tea. Of the daughters one was  thirteen and another fourteen, they both had snub noses, and I was  awfully shy of them because they were always whispering and giggling  together. The master of the house usually sat in his study on a leather  couch in front of the table with some grey-headed gentleman, usually a  colleague from our office or some other department. I never saw more  than two or three visitors there, always the same. They talked about  the excise duty; about business in the senate, about salaries, about  promotions, about His Excellency, and the best means of pleasing him,  and so on. I had the patience to sit like a fool beside these people  for four hours at a stretch, listening to them without knowing what to  say to them or venturing to say a word. I became stupefied, several  times I felt myself perspiring, I was overcome by a sort of paralysis;  but this was pleasant and good for me. On returning home I deferred for  a time my desire to embrace all mankind.    I had however one other acquaintance of a sort, Simonov, who was an old  schoolfellow. I had a number of schoolfellows, indeed, in Petersburg,  but I did not associate with them and had even given up nodding to them  in the street. I believe I had transferred into the department I was in  simply to avoid their company and to cut off all connection with my  hateful childhood. Curses on that school and all those terrible years  of penal servitude! In short, I parted from my schoolfellows as soon as  I got out into the world. There were two or three left to whom I nodded  in the street. One of them was Simonov, who had in no way been  distinguished at school, was of a quiet and equable disposition; but I  discovered in him a certain independence of character and even honesty  I don09t even suppose that he was particularly stupid. I had at one time  spent some rather soulful moments with him, but these had not lasted  long and had somehow been suddenly clouded over. He was evidently  uncomfortable at these reminiscences, and was, I fancy, always afraid  that I might take up the same tone again. I suspected that he had an  aversion for me, but still I went on going to see him, not being quite  certain of it.    And so on one occasion, unable to endure my solitude and knowing that  as it was Thursday Anton Antonitch09s door would be closed, I thought of  Simonov. Climbing up to his fourth storey I was thinking that the man  disliked me and that it was a mistake to go and see him. But as it  always happened that such reflections impelled me, as though purposely,  to put myself into a false position, I went in. It was almost a year  since I had last seen Simonov.          III      I found two of my old schoolfellows with him. They seemed to be  discussing an important matter. All of them took scarcely any notice of  my entrance, which was strange, for I had not met them for years.  Evidently they looked upon me as something on the level of a common  fly. I had not been treated like that even at school, though they all  hated me. I knew, of course, that they must despise me now for my lack  of success in the service, and for my having let myself sink so low,  going about badly dressed and so on04which seemed to them a sign of my  incapacity and insignificance. But I had not expected such contempt.  Simonov was positively surprised at my turning up. Even in old days he  had always seemed surprised at my coming. All this disconcerted me: I  sat down, feeling rather miserable, and began listening to what they  were saying.    They were engaged in warm and earnest conversation about a farewell  dinner which they wanted to arrange for the next day to a comrade of  theirs called Zverkov, an officer in the army, who was going away to a  distant province. This Zverkov had been all the time at school with me  too. I had begun to hate him particularly in the upper forms. In the  lower forms he had simply been a pretty, playful boy whom everybody  liked. I had hated him, however, even in the lower forms, just because  he was a pretty and playful boy. He was always bad at his lessons and  got worse and worse as he went on; however, he left with a good  certificate, as he had powerful interests. During his last year at  school he came in for an estate of two hundred serfs, and as almost all  of us were poor he took up a swaggering tone among us. He was vulgar in  the extreme, but at the same time he was a good-natured fellow, even in  his swaggering. In spite of superficial, fantastic and sham notions of  honour and dignity, all but very few of us positively grovelled before  Zverkov, and the more so the more he swaggered. And it was not from any  interested motive that they grovelled, but simply because he had been  favoured by the gifts of nature. Moreover, it was, as it were, an  accepted idea among us that Zverkov was a specialist in regard to tact  and the social graces. This last fact particularly infuriated me. I  hated the abrupt self-confident tone of his voice, his admiration of  his own witticisms, which were often frightfully stupid, though he was  bold in his language; I hated his handsome, but stupid face (for which  I would, however, have gladly exchanged my intelligent one), and the  free-and-easy military manners in fashion in the 0c09forties.0d I hated  the way in which he used to talk of his future conquests of women (he  did not venture to begin his attack upon women until he had the  epaulettes of an officer, and was looking forward to them with  impatience), and boasted of the duels he would constantly be fighting.  I remember how I, invariably so taciturn, suddenly fastened upon  Zverkov, when one day talking at a leisure moment with his  schoolfellows of his future relations with the fair sex, and growing as  sportive as a puppy in the sun, he all at once declared that he would  not leave a single village girl on his estate unnoticed, that that was  his _droit de seigneur_, and that if the peasants dared to protest he  would have them all flogged and double the tax on them, the bearded  rascals. Our servile rabble applauded, but I attacked him, not from  compassion for the girls and their fathers, but simply because they  were applauding such an insect. I got the better of him on that  occasion, but though Zverkov was stupid he was lively and impudent, and  so laughed it off, and in such a way that my victory was not really  complete; the laugh was on his side. He got the better of me on several  occasions afterwards, but without malice, jestingly, casually. I  remained angrily and contemptuously silent and would not answer him.  When we left school he made advances to me; I did not rebuff them, for  I was flattered, but we soon parted and quite naturally. Afterwards I  heard of his barrack-room success as a lieutenant, and of the fast life  he was leading. Then there came other rumours04of his successes in the  service. By then he had taken to cutting me in the street, and I  suspected that he was afraid of compromising himself by greeting a  personage as insignificant as me. I saw him once in the theatre, in the  third tier of boxes. By then he was wearing shoulder-straps. He was  twisting and twirling about, ingratiating himself with the daughters of  an ancient General. In three years he had gone off considerably, though  he was still rather handsome and adroit. One could see that by the time  he was thirty he would be corpulent. So it was to this Zverkov that my  schoolfellows were going to give a dinner on his departure. They had  kept up with him for those three years, though privately they did not  consider themselves on an equal footing with him, I am convinced of  that.    Of Simonov09s two visitors, one was Ferfitchkin, a Russianised German04a  little fellow with the face of a monkey, a blockhead who was always  deriding everyone, a very bitter enemy of mine from our days in the  lower forms04a vulgar, impudent, swaggering fellow, who affected a most  sensitive feeling of personal honour, though, of course, he was a  wretched little coward at heart. He was one of those worshippers of  Zverkov who made up to the latter from interested motives, and often  borrowed money from him. Simonov09s other visitor, Trudolyubov, was a  person in no way remarkable04a tall young fellow, in the army, with a  cold face, fairly honest, though he worshipped success of every sort,  and was only capable of thinking of promotion. He was some sort of  distant relation of Zverkov09s, and this, foolish as it seems, gave him  a certain importance among us. He always thought me of no consequence  whatever; his behaviour to me, though not quite courteous, was  tolerable.    0cWell, with seven roubles each,0d said Trudolyubov, 0ctwenty-one roubles  between the three of us, we ought to be able to get a good dinner.  Zverkov, of course, won09t pay.0d    0cOf course not, since we are inviting him,0d Simonov decided.    0cCan you imagine,0d Ferfitchkin interrupted hotly and conceitedly, like  some insolent flunkey boasting of his master the General09s decorations,  0ccan you imagine that Zverkov will let us pay alone? He will accept  from delicacy, but he will order half a dozen bottles of champagne.0d    0cDo we want half a dozen for the four of us?0d observed Trudolyubov,  taking notice only of the half dozen.    0cSo the three of us, with Zverkov for the fourth, twenty-one roubles,  at the Htel de Paris at five o09clock tomorrow,0d Simonov, who had been  asked to make the arrangements, concluded finally.    0cHow twenty-one roubles?0d I asked in some agitation, with a show of  being offended; 0cif you count me it will not be twenty-one, but  twenty-eight roubles.0d    It seemed to me that to invite myself so suddenly and unexpectedly  would be positively graceful, and that they would all be conquered at  once and would look at me with respect.    0cDo you want to join, too?0d Simonov observed, with no appearance of  pleasure, seeming to avoid looking at me. He knew me through and  through.    It infuriated me that he knew me so thoroughly.    0cWhy not? I am an old schoolfellow of his, too, I believe, and I must  own I feel hurt that you have left me out,0d I said, boiling over again.    0cAnd where were we to find you?0d Ferfitchkin put in roughly.    0cYou never were on good terms with Zverkov,0d Trudolyubov added,  frowning.    But I had already clutched at the idea and would not give it up.    0cIt seems to me that no one has a right to form an opinion upon that,0d  I retorted in a shaking voice, as though something tremendous had  happened. 0cPerhaps that is just my reason for wishing it now, that I  have not always been on good terms with him.0d    0cOh, there09s no making you out ... with these refinements,0d Trudolyubov  jeered.    0cWe09ll put your name down,0d Simonov decided, addressing me. 0cTomorrow  at five-o09clock at the Htel de Paris.0d    0cWhat about the money?0d Ferfitchkin began in an undertone, indicating  me to Simonov, but he broke off, for even Simonov was embarrassed.    0cThat will do,0d said Trudolyubov, getting up. 0cIf he wants to come so  much, let him.0d    0cBut it09s a private thing, between us friends,0d Ferfitchkin said  crossly, as he, too, picked up his hat. 0cIt09s not an official  gathering.0d    0cWe do not want at all, perhaps ...0d    They went away. Ferfitchkin did not greet me in any way as he went out,  Trudolyubov barely nodded. Simonov, with whom I was left _t\\\\xaate--t\\\\xaate_,  was in a state of vexation and perplexity, and looked at me queerly. He  did not sit down and did not ask me to.    0cH09m ... yes ... tomorrow, then. Will you pay your subscription now? I  just ask so as to know,0d he muttered in embarrassment.    I flushed crimson, as I did so I remembered that I had owed Simonov  fifteen roubles for ages04which I had, indeed, never forgotten, though I  had not paid it.    0cYou will understand, Simonov, that I could have no idea when I came  here.... I am very much vexed that I have forgotten....0d    0cAll right, all right, that doesn09t matter. You can pay tomorrow after  the dinner. I simply wanted to know.... Please don09t...0d    He broke off and began pacing the room still more vexed. As he walked  he began to stamp with his heels.    0cAm I keeping you?0d I asked, after two minutes of silence.    0cOh!0d he said, starting, 0cthat is04to be truthful04yes. I have to go and  see someone ... not far from here,0d he added in an apologetic voice,  somewhat abashed.    0cMy goodness, why didn09t you say so?0d I cried, seizing my cap, with an  astonishingly free-and-easy air, which was the last thing I should have  expected of myself.    0cIt09s close by ... not two paces away,0d Simonov repeated, accompanying  me to the front door with a fussy air which did not suit him at all.  0cSo five o09clock, punctually, tomorrow,0d he called down the stairs  after me. He was very glad to get rid of me. I was in a fury.    0cWhat possessed me, what possessed me to force myself upon them?0d I  wondered, grinding my teeth as I strode along the street, 0cfor a  scoundrel, a pig like that Zverkov! Of course I had better not go; of  course, I must just snap my fingers at them. I am not bound in any way.  I09ll send Simonov a note by tomorrow09s post....0d    But what made me furious was that I knew for certain that I should go,  that I should make a point of going; and the more tactless, the more  unseemly my going would be, the more certainly I would go.    And there was a positive obstacle to my going: I had no money. All I  had was nine roubles, I had to give seven of that to my servant,  Apollon, for his monthly wages. That was all I paid him04he had to keep  himself.    Not to pay him was impossible, considering his character. But I will  talk about that fellow, about that plague of mine, another time.    However, I knew I should go and should not pay him his wages.    That night I had the most hideous dreams. No wonder; all the evening I  had been oppressed by memories of my miserable days at school, and I  could not shake them off. I was sent to the school by distant  relations, upon whom I was dependent and of whom I have heard nothing  since04they sent me there a forlorn, silent boy, already crushed by  their reproaches, already troubled by doubt, and looking with savage  distrust at everyone. My schoolfellows met me with spiteful and  merciless jibes because I was not like any of them. But I could not  endure their taunts; I could not give in to them with the ignoble  readiness with which they gave in to one another. I hated them from the  first, and shut myself away from everyone in timid, wounded and  disproportionate pride. Their coarseness revolted me. They laughed  cynically at my face, at my clumsy figure; and yet what stupid faces  they had themselves. In our school the boys09 faces seemed in a special  way to degenerate and grow stupider. How many fine-looking boys came to  us! In a few years they became repulsive. Even at sixteen I wondered at  them morosely; even then I was struck by the pettiness of their  thoughts, the stupidity of their pursuits, their games, their  conversations. They had no understanding of such essential things, they  took no interest in such striking, impressive subjects, that I could  not help considering them inferior to myself. It was not wounded vanity  that drove me to it, and for God09s sake do not thrust upon me your  hackneyed remarks, repeated to nausea, that 0cI was only a dreamer,0d  while they even then had an understanding of life. They understood  nothing, they had no idea of real life, and I swear that that was what  made me most indignant with them. On the contrary, the most obvious,  striking reality they accepted with fantastic stupidity and even at  that time were accustomed to respect success. Everything that was just,  but oppressed and looked down upon, they laughed at heartlessly and  shamefully. They took rank for intelligence; even at sixteen they were  already talking about a snug berth. Of course, a great deal of it was  due to their stupidity, to the bad examples with which they had always  been surrounded in their childhood and boyhood. They were monstrously  depraved. Of course a great deal of that, too, was superficial and an  assumption of cynicism; of course there were glimpses of youth and  freshness even in their depravity; but even that freshness was not  attractive, and showed itself in a certain rakishness. I hated them  horribly, though perhaps I was worse than any of them. They repaid me  in the same way, and did not conceal their aversion for me. But by then  I did not desire their affection: on the contrary, I continually longed  for their humiliation. To escape from their derision I purposely began  to make all the progress I could with my studies and forced my way to  the very top. This impressed them. Moreover, they all began by degrees  to grasp that I had already read books none of them could read, and  understood things (not forming part of our school curriculum) of which  they had not even heard. They took a savage and sarcastic view of it,  but were morally impressed, especially as the teachers began to notice  me on those grounds. The mockery ceased, but the hostility remained,  and cold and strained relations became permanent between us. In the end  I could not put up with it: with years a craving for society, for  friends, developed in me. I attempted to get on friendly terms with  some of my schoolfellows; but somehow or other my intimacy with them  was always strained and soon ended of itself. Once, indeed, I did have  a friend. But I was already a tyrant at heart; I wanted to exercise  unbounded sway over him; I tried to instil into him a contempt for his  surroundings; I required of him a disdainful and complete break with  those surroundings. I frightened him with my passionate affection; I  reduced him to tears, to hysterics. He was a simple and devoted soul;  but when he devoted himself to me entirely I began to hate him  immediately and repulsed him04as though all I needed him for was to win  a victory over him, to subjugate him and nothing else. But I could not  subjugate all of them; my friend was not at all like them either, he  was, in fact, a rare exception. The first thing I did on leaving school  was to give up the special job for which I had been destined so as to  break all ties, to curse my past and shake the dust from off my  feet.... And goodness knows why, after all that, I should go trudging  off to Simonov09s!    Early next morning I roused myself and jumped out of bed with  excitement, as though it were all about to happen at once. But I  believed that some radical change in my life was coming, and would  inevitably come that day. Owing to its rarity, perhaps, any external  event, however trivial, always made me feel as though some radical  change in my life were at hand. I went to the office, however, as  usual, but sneaked away home two hours earlier to get ready. The great  thing, I thought, is not to be the first to arrive, or they will think  I am overjoyed at coming. But there were thousands of such great points  to consider, and they all agitated and overwhelmed me. I polished my  boots a second time with my own hands; nothing in the world would have  induced Apollon to clean them twice a day, as he considered that it was  more than his duties required of him. I stole the brushes to clean them  from the passage, being careful he should not detect it, for fear of  his contempt. Then I minutely examined my clothes and thought that  everything looked old, worn and threadbare. I had let myself get too  slovenly. My uniform, perhaps, was tidy, but I could not go out to  dinner in my uniform. The worst of it was that on the knee of my  trousers was a big yellow stain. I had a foreboding that that stain  would deprive me of nine-tenths of my personal dignity. I knew, too,  that it was very poor to think so. 0cBut this is no time for thinking:  now I am in for the real thing,0d I thought, and my heart sank. I knew,  too, perfectly well even then, that I was monstrously exaggerating the  facts. But how could I help it? I could not control myself and was  already shaking with fever. With despair I pictured to myself how  coldly and disdainfully that 0cscoundrel0d Zverkov would meet me; with  what dull-witted, invincible contempt the blockhead Trudolyubov would  look at me; with what impudent rudeness the insect Ferfitchkin would  snigger at me in order to curry favour with Zverkov; how completely  Simonov would take it all in, and how he would despise me for the  abjectness of my vanity and lack of spirit04and, worst of all, how  paltry, _unliterary_, commonplace it would all be. Of course, the best  thing would be not to go at all. But that was most impossible of all:  if I feel impelled to do anything, I seem to be pitchforked into it. I  should have jeered at myself ever afterwards: 0cSo you funked it, you  funked it, you funked the _real thing!_0d On the contrary, I  passionately longed to show all that 0crabble0d that I was by no means  such a spiritless creature as I seemed to myself. What is more, even in  the acutest paroxysm of this cowardly fever, I dreamed of getting the  upper hand, of dominating them, carrying them away, making them like  me04if only for my 0celevation of thought and unmistakable wit.0d They  would abandon Zverkov, he would sit on one side, silent and ashamed,  while I should crush him. Then, perhaps, we would be reconciled and  drink to our everlasting friendship; but what was most bitter and  humiliating for me was that I knew even then, knew fully and for  certain, that I needed nothing of all this really, that I did not  really want to crush, to subdue, to attract them, and that I did not  care a straw really for the result, even if I did achieve it. Oh, how I  prayed for the day to pass quickly! In unutterable anguish I went to  the window, opened the movable pane and looked out into the troubled  darkness of the thickly falling wet snow. At last my wretched little  clock hissed out five. I seized my hat and, trying not to look at  Apollon, who had been all day expecting his month09s wages, but in his  foolishness was unwilling to be the first to speak about it, I slipped  between him and the door and, jumping into a high-class sledge, on  which I spent my last half rouble, I drove up in grand style to the  Htel de Paris.          IV      I had been certain the day before that I should be the first to arrive.  But it was not a question of being the first to arrive. Not only were  they not there, but I had difficulty in finding our room. The table was  not laid even. What did it mean? After a good many questions I elicited  from the waiters that the dinner had been ordered not for five, but for  six o09clock. This was confirmed at the buffet too. I felt really  ashamed to go on questioning them. It was only twenty-five minutes past  five. If they changed the dinner hour they ought at least to have let  me know04that is what the post is for, and not to have put me in an  absurd position in my own eyes and ... and even before the waiters. I  sat down; the servant began laying the table; I felt even more  humiliated when he was present. Towards six o09clock they brought in  candles, though there were lamps burning in the room. It had not  occurred to the waiter, however, to bring them in at once when I  arrived. In the next room two gloomy, angry-looking persons were eating  their dinners in silence at two different tables. There was a great  deal of noise, even shouting, in a room further away; one could hear  the laughter of a crowd of people, and nasty little shrieks in French:  there were ladies at the dinner. It was sickening, in fact. I rarely  passed more unpleasant moments, so much so that when they did arrive  all together punctually at six I was overjoyed to see them, as though  they were my deliverers, and even forgot that it was incumbent upon me  to show resentment.    Zverkov walked in at the head of them; evidently he was the leading  spirit. He and all of them were laughing; but, seeing me, Zverkov drew  himself up a little, walked up to me deliberately with a slight, rather  jaunty bend from the waist. He shook hands with me in a friendly, but  not over-friendly, fashion, with a sort of circumspect courtesy like  that of a General, as though in giving me his hand he were warding off  something. I had imagined, on the contrary, that on coming in he would  at once break into his habitual thin, shrill laugh and fall to making  his insipid jokes and witticisms. I had been preparing for them ever  since the previous day, but I had not expected such condescension, such  high-official courtesy. So, then, he felt himself ineffably superior to  me in every respect! If he only meant to insult me by that  high-official tone, it would not matter, I thought04I could pay him back  for it one way or another. But what if, in reality, without the least  desire to be offensive, that sheepshead had a notion in earnest that he  was superior to me and could only look at me in a patronising way? The  very supposition made me gasp.    0cI was surprised to hear of your desire to join us,0d he began, lisping  and drawling, which was something new. 0cYou and I seem to have seen  nothing of one another. You fight shy of us. You shouldn09t. We are not  such terrible people as you think. Well, anyway, I am glad to renew our  acquaintance.0d    And he turned carelessly to put down his hat on the window.    0cHave you been waiting long?0d Trudolyubov inquired.    0cI arrived at five o09clock as you told me yesterday,0d I answered aloud,  with an irritability that threatened an explosion.    0cDidn09t you let him know that we had changed the hour?0d said  Trudolyubov to Simonov.    0cNo, I didn09t. I forgot,0d the latter replied, with no sign of regret,  and without even apologising to me he went off to order the _hors  d093uvres_.    0cSo you09ve been here a whole hour? Oh, poor fellow!0d Zverkov cried  ironically, for to his notions this was bound to be extremely funny.  That rascal Ferfitchkin followed with his nasty little snigger like a  puppy yapping. My position struck him, too, as exquisitely ludicrous  and embarrassing.    0cIt isn09t funny at all!0d I cried to Ferfitchkin, more and more  irritated. 0cIt wasn09t my fault, but other people09s. They neglected to  let me know. It was ... it was ... it was simply absurd.0d    0cIt09s not only absurd, but something else as well,0d muttered  Trudolyubov, naively taking my part. 0cYou are not hard enough upon it.  It was simply rudeness04unintentional, of course. And how could Simonov  ... h09m!0d    0cIf a trick like that had been played on me,0d observed Ferfitchkin, 0cI  should ...0d    0cBut you should have ordered something for yourself,0d Zverkov  interrupted, 0cor simply asked for dinner without waiting for us.0d    0cYou will allow that I might have done that without your permission,0d I  rapped out. 0cIf I waited, it was ...0d    0cLet us sit down, gentlemen,0d cried Simonov, coming in. 0cEverything is  ready; I can answer for the champagne; it is capitally frozen.... You  see, I did not know your address, where was I to look for you?0d he  suddenly turned to me, but again he seemed to avoid looking at me.  Evidently he had something against me. It must have been what happened  yesterday.    All sat down; I did the same. It was a round table. Trudolyubov was on  my left, Simonov on my right, Zverkov was sitting opposite, Ferfitchkin  next to him, between him and Trudolyubov.    0cTell me, are you ... in a government office?0d Zverkov went on  attending to me. Seeing that I was embarrassed he seriously thought  that he ought to be friendly to me, and, so to speak, cheer me up.    0cDoes he want me to throw a bottle at his head?0d I thought, in a fury.  In my novel surroundings I was unnaturally ready to be irritated.    0cIn the N0404 office,0d I answered jerkily, with my eyes on my plate.    0cAnd ha-ave you a go-od berth? I say, what ma-a-de you leave your  original job?0d    0cWhat ma-a-de me was that I wanted to leave my original job,0d I drawled  more than he, hardly able to control myself. Ferfitchkin went off into  a guffaw. Simonov looked at me ironically. Trudolyubov left off eating  and began looking at me with curiosity.    Zverkov winced, but he tried not to notice it.    0cAnd the remuneration?0d    0cWhat remuneration?0d    0cI mean, your sa-a-lary?0d    0cWhy are you cross-examining me?0d However, I told him at once what my  salary was. I turned horribly red.    0cIt is not very handsome,0d Zverkov observed majestically.    0cYes, you can09t afford to dine at cafs on that,0d Ferfitchkin added  insolently.    0cTo my thinking it09s very poor,0d Trudolyubov observed gravely.    0cAnd how thin you have grown! How you have changed!0d added Zverkov,  with a shade of venom in his voice, scanning me and my attire with a  sort of insolent compassion.    0cOh, spare his blushes,0d cried Ferfitchkin, sniggering.    0cMy dear sir, allow me to tell you I am not blushing,0d I broke out at  last; 0cdo you hear? I am dining here, at this cafe, at my own expense,  not at other people09s04note that, Mr. Ferfitchkin.0d    0cWha-at? Isn09t every one here dining at his own expense? You would seem  to be ...0d Ferfitchkin flew out at me, turning as red as a lobster, and  looking me in the face with fury.    0cTha-at,0d I answered, feeling I had gone too far, 0cand I imagine it  would be better to talk of something more intelligent.0d    0cYou intend to show off your intelligence, I suppose?0d    0cDon09t disturb yourself, that would be quite out of place here.0d    0cWhy are you clacking away like that, my good sir, eh? Have you gone  out of your wits in your office?0d    0cEnough, gentlemen, enough!0d Zverkov cried, authoritatively.    0cHow stupid it is!0d muttered Simonov.    0cIt really is stupid. We have met here, a company of friends, for a  farewell dinner to a comrade and you carry on an altercation,0d said  Trudolyubov, rudely addressing himself to me alone. 0cYou invited  yourself to join us, so don09t disturb the general harmony.0d    0cEnough, enough!0d cried Zverkov. 0cGive over, gentlemen, it09s out of  place. Better let me tell you how I nearly got married the day before  yesterday....0d    And then followed a burlesque narrative of how this gentleman had  almost been married two days before. There was not a word about the  marriage, however, but the story was adorned with generals, colonels  and kammer-junkers, while Zverkov almost took the lead among them. It  was greeted with approving laughter; Ferfitchkin positively squealed.    No one paid any attention to me, and I sat crushed and humiliated.    0cGood Heavens, these are not the people for me!0d I thought. 0cAnd what a  fool I have made of myself before them! I let Ferfitchkin go too far,  though. The brutes imagine they are doing me an honour in letting me  sit down with them. They don09t understand that it09s an honour to them  and not to me! I09ve grown thinner! My clothes! Oh, damn my trousers!  Zverkov noticed the yellow stain on the knee as soon as he came in....  But what09s the use! I must get up at once, this very minute, take my  hat and simply go without a word ... with contempt! And tomorrow I can  send a challenge. The scoundrels! As though I cared about the seven  roubles. They may think.... Damn it! I don09t care about the seven  roubles. I09ll go this minute!0d    Of course I remained. I drank sherry and Lafitte by the glassful in my  discomfiture. Being unaccustomed to it, I was quickly affected. My  annoyance increased as the wine went to my head. I longed all at once  to insult them all in a most flagrant manner and then go away. To seize  the moment and show what I could do, so that they would say, 0cHe09s  clever, though he is absurd,0d and ... and ... in fact, damn them all!    I scanned them all insolently with my drowsy eyes. But they seemed to  have forgotten me altogether. They were noisy, vociferous, cheerful.  Zverkov was talking all the time. I began listening. Zverkov was  talking of some exuberant lady whom he had at last led on to declaring  her love (of course, he was lying like a horse), and how he had been  helped in this affair by an intimate friend of his, a Prince Kolya, an  officer in the hussars, who had three thousand serfs.    0cAnd yet this Kolya, who has three thousand serfs, has not put in an  appearance here tonight to see you off,0d I cut in suddenly.    For one minute every one was silent. 0cYou are drunk already.0d  Trudolyubov deigned to notice me at last, glancing contemptuously in my  direction. Zverkov, without a word, examined me as though I were an  insect. I dropped my eyes. Simonov made haste to fill up the glasses  with champagne.    Trudolyubov raised his glass, as did everyone else but me.    0cYour health and good luck on the journey!0d he cried to Zverkov. 0cTo  old times, to our future, hurrah!0d    They all tossed off their glasses, and crowded round Zverkov to kiss  him. I did not move; my full glass stood untouched before me.    0cWhy, aren09t you going to drink it?0d roared Trudolyubov, losing  patience and turning menacingly to me.    0cI want to make a speech separately, on my own account ... and then  I09ll drink it, Mr. Trudolyubov.0d    0cSpiteful brute!0d muttered Simonov. I drew myself up in my chair and  feverishly seized my glass, prepared for something extraordinary,  though I did not know myself precisely what I was going to say.    0c_Silence!_0d cried Ferfitchkin. 0cNow for a display of wit!0d    Zverkov waited very gravely, knowing what was coming.    0cMr. Lieutenant Zverkov,0d I began, 0clet me tell you that I hate  phrases, phrasemongers and men in corsets ... that09s the first point,  and there is a second one to follow it.0d    There was a general stir.    0cThe second point is: I hate ribaldry and ribald talkers. Especially  ribald talkers! The third point: I love justice, truth and honesty.0d I  went on almost mechanically, for I was beginning to shiver with horror  myself and had no idea how I came to be talking like this. 0cI love  thought, Monsieur Zverkov; I love true comradeship, on an equal footing  and not ... H09m ... I love ... But, however, why not? I will drink your  health, too, Mr. Zverkov. Seduce the Circassian girls, shoot the  enemies of the fatherland and ... and ... to your health, Monsieur  Zverkov!0d    Zverkov got up from his seat, bowed to me and said:    0cI am very much obliged to you.0d He was frightfully offended and turned  pale.    0cDamn the fellow!0d roared Trudolyubov, bringing his fist down on the  table.    0cWell, he wants a punch in the face for that,0d squealed Ferfitchkin.    0cWe ought to turn him out,0d muttered Simonov.    0cNot a word, gentlemen, not a movement!0d cried Zverkov solemnly,  checking the general indignation. 0cI thank you all, but I can show him  for myself how much value I attach to his words.0d    0cMr. Ferfitchkin, you will give me satisfaction tomorrow for your words  just now!0d I said aloud, turning with dignity to Ferfitchkin.    0cA duel, you mean? Certainly,0d he answered. But probably I was so  ridiculous as I challenged him and it was so out of keeping with my  appearance that everyone including Ferfitchkin was prostrate with  laughter.    0cYes, let him alone, of course! He is quite drunk,0d Trudolyubov said  with disgust.    0cI shall never forgive myself for letting him join us,0d Simonov  muttered again.    0cNow is the time to throw a bottle at their heads,0d I thought to  myself. I picked up the bottle ... and filled my glass.... 0cNo, I09d  better sit on to the end,0d I went on thinking; 0cyou would be pleased,  my friends, if I went away. Nothing will induce me to go. I09ll go on  sitting here and drinking to the end, on purpose, as a sign that I  don09t think you of the slightest consequence. I will go on sitting and  drinking, because this is a public-house and I paid my entrance money.  I09ll sit here and drink, for I look upon you as so many pawns, as  inanimate pawns. I09ll sit here and drink ... and sing if I want to,  yes, sing, for I have the right to ... to sing ... H09m!0d    But I did not sing. I simply tried not to look at any of them. I  assumed most unconcerned attitudes and waited with impatience for them  to speak _first_. But alas, they did not address me! And oh, how I  wished, how I wished at that moment to be reconciled to them! It struck  eight, at last nine. They moved from the table to the sofa. Zverkov  stretched himself on a lounge and put one foot on a round table. Wine  was brought there. He did, as a fact, order three bottles on his own  account. I, of course, was not invited to join them. They all sat round  him on the sofa. They listened to him, almost with reverence. It was  evident that they were fond of him. 0cWhat for? What for?0d I wondered.  From time to time they were moved to drunken enthusiasm and kissed each  other. They talked of the Caucasus, of the nature of true passion, of  snug berths in the service, of the income of an hussar called  Podharzhevsky, whom none of them knew personally, and rejoiced in the  largeness of it, of the extraordinary grace and beauty of a Princess  D., whom none of them had ever seen; then it came to Shakespeare09s  being immortal.    I smiled contemptuously and walked up and down the other side of the  room, opposite the sofa, from the table to the stove and back again. I  tried my very utmost to show them that I could do without them, and yet  I purposely made a noise with my boots, thumping with my heels. But it  was all in vain. They paid no attention. I had the patience to walk up  and down in front of them from eight o09clock till eleven, in the same  place, from the table to the stove and back again. 0cI walk up and down  to please myself and no one can prevent me.0d The waiter who came into  the room stopped, from time to time, to look at me. I was somewhat  giddy from turning round so often; at moments it seemed to me that I  was in delirium. During those three hours I was three times soaked with  sweat and dry again. At times, with an intense, acute pang I was  stabbed to the heart by the thought that ten years, twenty years, forty  years would pass, and that even in forty years I would remember with  loathing and humiliation those filthiest, most ludicrous, and most  awful moments of my life. No one could have gone out of his way to  degrade himself more shamelessly, and I fully realised it, fully, and  yet I went on pacing up and down from the table to the stove. 0cOh, if  you only knew what thoughts and feelings I am capable of, how cultured  I am!0d I thought at moments, mentally addressing the sofa on which my  enemies were sitting. But my enemies behaved as though I were not in  the room. Once04only once04they turned towards me, just when Zverkov was  talking about Shakespeare, and I suddenly gave a contemptuous laugh. I  laughed in such an affected and disgusting way that they all at once  broke off their conversation, and silently and gravely for two minutes  watched me walking up and down from the table to the stove, _taking no  notice of them_. But nothing came of it: they said nothing, and two  minutes later they ceased to notice me again. It struck eleven.    0cFriends,0d cried Zverkov getting up from the sofa, 0clet us all be off  now, _there!_0d    0cOf course, of course,0d the others assented. I turned sharply to  Zverkov. I was so harassed, so exhausted, that I would have cut my  throat to put an end to it. I was in a fever; my hair, soaked with  perspiration, stuck to my forehead and temples.    0cZverkov, I beg your pardon,0d I said abruptly and resolutely.  0cFerfitchkin, yours too, and everyone09s, everyone09s: I have insulted  you all!0d    0cAha! A duel is not in your line, old man,0d Ferfitchkin hissed  venomously.    It sent a sharp pang to my heart.    0cNo, it09s not the duel I am afraid of, Ferfitchkin! I am ready to fight  you tomorrow, after we are reconciled. I insist upon it, in fact, and  you cannot refuse. I want to show you that I am not afraid of a duel.  You shall fire first and I shall fire into the air.0d    0cHe is comforting himself,0d said Simonov.    0cHe09s simply raving,0d said Trudolyubov.    0cBut let us pass. Why are you barring our way? What do you want?0d  Zverkov answered disdainfully.    They were all flushed, their eyes were bright: they had been drinking  heavily.    0cI ask for your friendship, Zverkov; I insulted you, but ...0d    0cInsulted? _You_ insulted _me?_ Understand, sir, that you never, under  any circumstances, could possibly insult _me_.0d    0cAnd that09s enough for you. Out of the way!0d concluded Trudolyubov.    0cOlympia is mine, friends, that09s agreed!0d cried Zverkov.    0cWe won09t dispute your right, we won09t dispute your right,0d the others  answered, laughing.    I stood as though spat upon. The party went noisily out of the room.  Trudolyubov struck up some stupid song. Simonov remained behind for a  moment to tip the waiters. I suddenly went up to him.    0cSimonov! give me six roubles!0d I said, with desperate resolution.    He looked at me in extreme amazement, with vacant eyes. He, too, was  drunk.    0cYou don09t mean you are coming with us?0d    0cYes.0d    0cI09ve no money,0d he snapped out, and with a scornful laugh he went out  of the room.    I clutched at his overcoat. It was a nightmare.    0cSimonov, I saw you had money. Why do you refuse me? Am I a scoundrel?  Beware of refusing me: if you knew, if you knew why I am asking! My  whole future, my whole plans depend upon it!0d    Simonov pulled out the money and almost flung it at me.    0cTake it, if you have no sense of shame!0d he pronounced pitilessly, and  ran to overtake them.    I was left for a moment alone. Disorder, the remains of dinner, a  broken wine-glass on the floor, spilt wine, cigarette ends, fumes of  drink and delirium in my brain, an agonising misery in my heart and  finally the waiter, who had seen and heard all and was looking  inquisitively into my face.    0cI am going there!0d I cried. 0cEither they shall all go down on their  knees to beg for my friendship, or I will give Zverkov a slap in the  face!0d          V      0cSo this is it, this is it at last04contact with real life,0d I muttered  as I ran headlong downstairs. 0cThis is very different from the Pope09s  leaving Rome and going to Brazil, very different from the ball on Lake  Como!0d    0cYou are a scoundrel,0d a thought flashed through my mind, 0cif you laugh  at this now.0d    0cNo matter!0d I cried, answering myself. 0cNow everything is lost!0d    There was no trace to be seen of them, but that made no difference04I  knew where they had gone.    At the steps was standing a solitary night sledge-driver in a rough  peasant coat, powdered over with the still falling, wet, and as it were  warm, snow. It was hot and steamy. The little shaggy piebald horse was  also covered with snow and coughing, I remember that very well. I made  a rush for the roughly made sledge; but as soon as I raised my foot to  get into it, the recollection of how Simonov had just given me six  roubles seemed to double me up and I tumbled into the sledge like a  sack.    0cNo, I must do a great deal to make up for all that,0d I cried. 0cBut I  will make up for it or perish on the spot this very night. Start!0d    We set off. There was a perfect whirl in my head.    0cThey won09t go down on their knees to beg for my friendship. That is a  mirage, cheap mirage, revolting, romantic and fantastical04that09s  another ball on Lake Como. And so I am bound to slap Zverkov09s face! It  is my duty to. And so it is settled; I am flying to give him a slap in  the face. Hurry up!0d    The driver tugged at the reins.    0cAs soon as I go in I09ll give it him. Ought I before giving him the  slap to say a few words by way of preface? No. I09ll simply go in and  give it him. They will all be sitting in the drawing-room, and he with  Olympia on the sofa. That damned Olympia! She laughed at my looks on  one occasion and refused me. I09ll pull Olympia09s hair, pull Zverkov09s  ears! No, better one ear, and pull him by it round the room. Maybe they  will all begin beating me and will kick me out. That09s most likely,  indeed. No matter! Anyway, I shall first slap him; the initiative will  be mine; and by the laws of honour that is everything: he will be  branded and cannot wipe off the slap by any blows, by nothing but a  duel. He will be forced to fight. And let them beat me now. Let them,  the ungrateful wretches! Trudolyubov will beat me hardest, he is so  strong; Ferfitchkin will be sure to catch hold sideways and tug at my  hair. But no matter, no matter! That09s what I am going for. The  blockheads will be forced at last to see the tragedy of it all! When  they drag me to the door I shall call out to them that in reality they  are not worth my little finger. Get on, driver, get on!0d I cried to the  driver. He started and flicked his whip, I shouted so savagely.    0cWe shall fight at daybreak, that09s a settled thing. I09ve done with the  office. Ferfitchkin made a joke about it just now. But where can I get  pistols? Nonsense! I09ll get my salary in advance and buy them. And  powder, and bullets? That09s the second09s business. And how can it all  be done by daybreak? and where am I to get a second? I have no friends.  Nonsense!0d I cried, lashing myself up more and more. 0cIt09s of no  consequence! The first person I meet in the street is bound to be my  second, just as he would be bound to pull a drowning man out of water.  The most eccentric things may happen. Even if I were to ask the  director himself to be my second tomorrow, he would be bound to  consent, if only from a feeling of chivalry, and to keep the secret!  Anton Antonitch....0d    The fact is, that at that very minute the disgusting absurdity of my  plan and the other side of the question was clearer and more vivid to  my imagination than it could be to anyone on earth. But ....    0cGet on, driver, get on, you rascal, get on!0d    0cUgh, sir!0d said the son of toil.    Cold shivers suddenly ran down me. Wouldn09t it be better ... to go  straight home? My God, my God! Why did I invite myself to this dinner  yesterday? But no, it09s impossible. And my walking up and down for  three hours from the table to the stove? No, they, they and no one else  must pay for my walking up and down! They must wipe out this dishonour!  Drive on!    And what if they give me into custody? They won09t dare! They09ll be  afraid of the scandal. And what if Zverkov is so contemptuous that he  refuses to fight a duel? He is sure to; but in that case I09ll show them  ... I will turn up at the posting station when he09s setting off  tomorrow, I09ll catch him by the leg, I09ll pull off his coat when he  gets into the carriage. I09ll get my teeth into his hand, I09ll bite him.  0cSee what lengths you can drive a desperate man to!0d He may hit me on  the head and they may belabour me from behind. I will shout to the  assembled multitude: 0cLook at this young puppy who is driving off to  captivate the Circassian girls after letting me spit in his face!0d    Of course, after that everything will be over! The office will have  vanished off the face of the earth. I shall be arrested, I shall be  tried, I shall be dismissed from the service, thrown in prison, sent to  Siberia. Never mind! In fifteen years when they let me out of prison I  will trudge off to him, a beggar, in rags. I shall find him in some  provincial town. He will be married and happy. He will have a grown-up  daughter.... I shall say to him: 0cLook, monster, at my hollow cheeks  and my rags! I09ve lost everything04my career, my happiness, art,  science, _the woman I loved_, and all through you. Here are pistols. I  have come to discharge my pistol and ... and I ... forgive you. Then I  shall fire into the air and he will hear nothing more of me....0d    I was actually on the point of tears, though I knew perfectly well at  that moment that all this was out of Pushkin09s _Silvio_ and Lermontov09s  _Masquerade_. And all at once I felt horribly ashamed, so ashamed that  I stopped the horse, got out of the sledge, and stood still in the snow  in the middle of the street. The driver gazed at me, sighing and  astonished.    What was I to do? I could not go on there04it was evidently stupid, and  I could not leave things as they were, because that would seem as  though ... Heavens, how could I leave things! And after such insults!  0cNo!0d I cried, throwing myself into the sledge again. 0cIt is ordained!  It is fate! Drive on, drive on!0d    And in my impatience I punched the sledge-driver on the back of the  neck.    0cWhat are you up to? What are you hitting me for?0d the peasant shouted,  but he whipped up his nag so that it began kicking.    The wet snow was falling in big flakes; I unbuttoned myself, regardless  of it. I forgot everything else, for I had finally decided on the slap,  and felt with horror that it was going to happen _now, at once_, and  that _no force could stop it_. The deserted street lamps gleamed  sullenly in the snowy darkness like torches at a funeral. The snow  drifted under my great-coat, under my coat, under my cravat, and melted  there. I did not wrap myself up04all was lost, anyway.    At last we arrived. I jumped out, almost unconscious, ran up the steps  and began knocking and kicking at the door. I felt fearfully weak,  particularly in my legs and knees. The door was opened quickly as  though they knew I was coming. As a fact, Simonov had warned them that  perhaps another gentleman would arrive, and this was a place in which  one had to give notice and to observe certain precautions. It was one  of those 0cmillinery establishments0d which were abolished by the police  a good time ago. By day it really was a shop; but at night, if one had  an introduction, one might visit it for other purposes.    I walked rapidly through the dark shop into the familiar drawing-room,  where there was only one candle burning, and stood still in amazement:  there was no one there. 0cWhere are they?0d I asked somebody. But by now,  of course, they had separated. Before me was standing a person with a  stupid smile, the 0cmadam0d herself, who had seen me before. A minute  later a door opened and another person came in.    Taking no notice of anything I strode about the room, and, I believe, I  talked to myself. I felt as though I had been saved from death and was  conscious of this, joyfully, all over: I should have given that slap, I  should certainly, certainly have given it! But now they were not here  and ... everything had vanished and changed! I looked round. I could  not realise my condition yet. I looked mechanically at the girl who had  come in: and had a glimpse of a fresh, young, rather pale face, with  straight, dark eyebrows, and with grave, as it were wondering, eyes  that attracted me at once; I should have hated her if she had been  smiling. I began looking at her more intently and, as it were, with  effort. I had not fully collected my thoughts. There was something  simple and good-natured in her face, but something strangely grave. I  am sure that this stood in her way here, and no one of those fools had  noticed her. She could not, however, have been called a beauty, though  she was tall, strong-looking, and well built. She was very simply  dressed. Something loathsome stirred within me. I went straight up to  her.    I chanced to look into the glass. My harassed face struck me as  revolting in the extreme, pale, angry, abject, with dishevelled hair.  0cNo matter, I am glad of it,0d I thought; 0cI am glad that I shall seem  repulsive to her; I like that.0d          VI      ... Somewhere behind a screen a clock began wheezing, as though  oppressed by something, as though someone were strangling it. After an  unnaturally prolonged wheezing there followed a shrill, nasty, and as  it were unexpectedly rapid, chime04as though someone were suddenly  jumping forward. It struck two. I woke up, though I had indeed not been  asleep but lying half-conscious.    It was almost completely dark in the narrow, cramped, low-pitched room,  cumbered up with an enormous wardrobe and piles of cardboard boxes and  all sorts of frippery and litter. The candle end that had been burning  on the table was going out and gave a faint flicker from time to time.  In a few minutes there would be complete darkness.    I was not long in coming to myself; everything came back to my mind at  once, without an effort, as though it had been in ambush to pounce upon  me again. And, indeed, even while I was unconscious a point seemed  continually to remain in my memory unforgotten, and round it my dreams  moved drearily. But strange to say, everything that had happened to me  in that day seemed to me now, on waking, to be in the far, far away  past, as though I had long, long ago lived all that down.    My head was full of fumes. Something seemed to be hovering over me,  rousing me, exciting me, and making me restless. Misery and spite  seemed surging up in me again and seeking an outlet. Suddenly I saw  beside me two wide open eyes scrutinising me curiously and  persistently. The look in those eyes was coldly detached, sullen, as it  were utterly remote; it weighed upon me.    A grim idea came into my brain and passed all over my body, as a  horrible sensation, such as one feels when one goes into a damp and  mouldy cellar. There was something unnatural in those two eyes,  beginning to look at me only now. I recalled, too, that during those  two hours I had not said a single word to this creature, and had, in  fact, considered it utterly superfluous; in fact, the silence had for  some reason gratified me. Now I suddenly realised vividly the hideous  idea04revolting as a spider04of vice, which, without love, grossly and  shamelessly begins with that in which true love finds its consummation.  For a long time we gazed at each other like that, but she did not drop  her eyes before mine and her expression did not change, so that at last  I felt uncomfortable.    0cWhat is your name?0d I asked abruptly, to put an end to it.    0cLiza,0d she answered almost in a whisper, but somehow far from  graciously, and she turned her eyes away.    I was silent.    0cWhat weather! The snow ... it09s disgusting!0d I said, almost to myself,  putting my arm under my head despondently, and gazing at the ceiling.    She made no answer. This was horrible.    0cHave you always lived in Petersburg?0d I asked a minute later, almost  angrily, turning my head slightly towards her.    0cNo.0d    0cWhere do you come from?0d    0cFrom Riga,0d she answered reluctantly.    0cAre you a German?0d    0cNo, Russian.0d    0cHave you been here long?0d    0cWhere?0d    0cIn this house?0d    0cA fortnight.0d    She spoke more and more jerkily. The candle went out; I could no longer  distinguish her face.    0cHave you a father and mother?0d    0cYes ... no ... I have.0d    0cWhere are they?0d    0cThere ... in Riga.0d    0cWhat are they?0d    0cOh, nothing.0d    0cNothing? Why, what class are they?0d    0cTradespeople.0d    0cHave you always lived with them?0d    0cYes.0d    0cHow old are you?0d    0cTwenty.0d    0cWhy did you leave them?0d    0cOh, for no reason.0d    That answer meant 0cLet me alone; I feel sick, sad.0d    We were silent.    God knows why I did not go away. I felt myself more and more sick and  dreary. The images of the previous day began of themselves, apart from  my will, flitting through my memory in confusion. I suddenly recalled  something I had seen that morning when, full of anxious thoughts, I was  hurrying to the office.    0cI saw them carrying a coffin out yesterday and they nearly dropped  it,0d I suddenly said aloud, not that I desired to open the  conversation, but as it were by accident.    0cA coffin?0d    0cYes, in the Haymarket; they were bringing it up out of a cellar.0d    0cFrom a cellar?0d    0cNot from a cellar, but a basement. Oh, you know ... down below ...  from a house of ill-fame. It was filthy all round ... Egg-shells,  litter ... a stench. It was loathsome.0d    Silence.    0cA nasty day to be buried,0d I began, simply to avoid being silent.    0cNasty, in what way?0d    0cThe snow, the wet.0d (I yawned.)    0cIt makes no difference,0d she said suddenly, after a brief silence.    0cNo, it09s horrid.0d (I yawned again). 0cThe gravediggers must have sworn  at getting drenched by the snow. And there must have been water in the  grave.0d    0cWhy water in the grave?0d she asked, with a sort of curiosity, but  speaking even more harshly and abruptly than before.    I suddenly began to feel provoked.    0cWhy, there must have been water at the bottom a foot deep. You can09t  dig a dry grave in Volkovo Cemetery.0d    0cWhy?0d    0cWhy? Why, the place is waterlogged. It09s a regular marsh. So they bury  them in water. I09ve seen it myself ... many times.0d    (I had never seen it once, indeed I had never been in Volkovo, and had  only heard stories of it.)    0cDo you mean to say, you don09t mind how you die?0d    0cBut why should I die?0d she answered, as though defending herself.    0cWhy, some day you will die, and you will die just the same as that  dead woman. She was ... a girl like you. She died of consumption.0d    0cA wench would have died in hospital ...0d (She knows all about it  already: she said 0cwench,0d not 0cgirl.0d)    0cShe was in debt to her madam,0d I retorted, more and more provoked by  the discussion; 0cand went on earning money for her up to the end,  though she was in consumption. Some sledge-drivers standing by were  talking about her to some soldiers and telling them so. No doubt they  knew her. They were laughing. They were going to meet in a pot-house to  drink to her memory.0d    A great deal of this was my invention. Silence followed, profound  silence. She did not stir.    0cAnd is it better to die in a hospital?0d    0cIsn09t it just the same? Besides, why should I die?0d she added  irritably.    0cIf not now, a little later.0d    0cWhy a little later?0d    0cWhy, indeed? Now you are young, pretty, fresh, you fetch a high price.  But after another year of this life you will be very different04you will  go off.0d    0cIn a year?0d    0cAnyway, in a year you will be worth less,0d I continued malignantly.  0cYou will go from here to something lower, another house; a year  later04to a third, lower and lower, and in seven years you will come to  a basement in the Haymarket. That will be if you were lucky. But it  would be much worse if you got some disease, consumption, say ... and  caught a chill, or something or other. It09s not easy to get over an  illness in your way of life. If you catch anything you may not get rid  of it. And so you would die.0d    0cOh, well, then I shall die,0d she answered, quite vindictively, and she  made a quick movement.    0cBut one is sorry.0d    0cSorry for whom?0d    0cSorry for life.0d Silence.    0cHave you been engaged to be married? Eh?0d    0cWhat09s that to you?0d    0cOh, I am not cross-examining you. It09s nothing to me. Why are you so  cross? Of course you may have had your own troubles. What is it to me?  It09s simply that I felt sorry.0d    0cSorry for whom?0d    0cSorry for you.0d    0cNo need,0d she whispered hardly audibly, and again made a faint  movement.    That incensed me at once. What! I was so gentle with her, and she....    0cWhy, do you think that you are on the right path?0d    0cI don09t think anything.0d    0cThat09s what09s wrong, that you don09t think. Realise it while there is  still time. There still is time. You are still young, good-looking; you  might love, be married, be happy....0d    0cNot all married women are happy,0d she snapped out in the rude abrupt  tone she had used at first.    0cNot all, of course, but anyway it is much better than the life here.  Infinitely better. Besides, with love one can live even without  happiness. Even in sorrow life is sweet; life is sweet, however one  lives. But here what is there but ... foulness? Phew!0d    I turned away with disgust; I was no longer reasoning coldly. I began  to feel myself what I was saying and warmed to the subject. I was  already longing to expound the cherished ideas I had brooded over in my  corner. Something suddenly flared up in me. An object had appeared  before me.    0cNever mind my being here, I am not an example for you. I am, perhaps,  worse than you are. I was drunk when I came here, though,0d I hastened,  however, to say in self-defence. 0cBesides, a man is no example for a  woman. It09s a different thing. I may degrade and defile myself, but I  am not anyone09s slave. I come and go, and that09s an end of it. I shake  it off, and I am a different man. But you are a slave from the start.  Yes, a slave! You give up everything, your whole freedom. If you want  to break your chains afterwards, you won09t be able to; you will be more  and more fast in the snares. It is an accursed bondage. I know it. I  won09t speak of anything else, maybe you won09t understand, but tell me:  no doubt you are in debt to your madam? There, you see,0d I added,  though she made no answer, but only listened in silence, entirely  absorbed, 0cthat09s a bondage for you! You will never buy your freedom.  They will see to that. It09s like selling your soul to the devil.... And  besides ... perhaps, I too, am just as unlucky04how do you know04and  wallow in the mud on purpose, out of misery? You know, men take to  drink from grief; well, maybe I am here from grief. Come, tell me, what  is there good here? Here you and I ... came together ... just now and  did not say one word to one another all the time, and it was only  afterwards you began staring at me like a wild creature, and I at you.  Is that loving? Is that how one human being should meet another? It09s  hideous, that09s what it is!0d    0cYes!0d she assented sharply and hurriedly.    I was positively astounded by the promptitude of this 0cYes.0d So the  same thought may have been straying through her mind when she was  staring at me just before. So she, too, was capable of certain  thoughts? 0cDamn it all, this was interesting, this was a point of  likeness!0d I thought, almost rubbing my hands. And indeed it09s easy to  turn a young soul like that!    It was the exercise of my power that attracted me most.    She turned her head nearer to me, and it seemed to me in the darkness  that she propped herself on her arm. Perhaps she was scrutinising me.  How I regretted that I could not see her eyes. I heard her deep  breathing.    0cWhy have you come here?0d I asked her, with a note of authority already  in my voice.    0cOh, I don09t know.0d    0cBut how nice it would be to be living in your father09s house! It09s  warm and free; you have a home of your own.0d    0cBut what if it09s worse than this?0d    0cI must take the right tone,0d flashed through my mind. 0cI may not get  far with sentimentality.0d But it was only a momentary thought. I swear  she really did interest me. Besides, I was exhausted and moody. And  cunning so easily goes hand-in-hand with feeling.    0cWho denies it!0d I hastened to answer. 0cAnything may happen. I am  convinced that someone has wronged you, and that you are more sinned  against than sinning. Of course, I know nothing of your story, but it09s  not likely a girl like you has come here of her own inclination....0d    0cA girl like me?0d she whispered, hardly audibly; but I heard it.    Damn it all, I was flattering her. That was horrid. But perhaps it was  a good thing.... She was silent.    0cSee, Liza, I will tell you about myself. If I had had a home from  childhood, I shouldn09t be what I am now. I often think that. However  bad it may be at home, anyway they are your father and mother, and not  enemies, strangers. Once a year at least, they09ll show their love of  you. Anyway, you know you are at home. I grew up without a home; and  perhaps that09s why I09ve turned so ... unfeeling.0d    I waited again. 0cPerhaps she doesn09t understand,0d I thought, 0cand,  indeed, it is absurd04it09s moralising.0d    0cIf I were a father and had a daughter, I believe I should love my  daughter more than my sons, really,0d I began indirectly, as though  talking of something else, to distract her attention. I must confess I  blushed.    0cWhy so?0d she asked.    Ah! so she was listening!    0cI don09t know, Liza. I knew a father who was a stern, austere man, but  used to go down on his knees to his daughter, used to kiss her hands,  her feet, he couldn09t make enough of her, really. When she danced at  parties he used to stand for five hours at a stretch, gazing at her. He  was mad over her: I understand that! She would fall asleep tired at  night, and he would wake to kiss her in her sleep and make the sign of  the cross over her. He would go about in a dirty old coat, he was  stingy to everyone else, but would spend his last penny for her, giving  her expensive presents, and it was his greatest delight when she was  pleased with what he gave her. Fathers always love their daughters more  than the mothers do. Some girls live happily at home! And I believe I  should never let my daughters marry.0d    0cWhat next?0d she said, with a faint smile.    0cI should be jealous, I really should. To think that she should kiss  anyone else! That she should love a stranger more than her father! It09s  painful to imagine it. Of course, that09s all nonsense, of course every  father would be reasonable at last. But I believe before I should let  her marry, I should worry myself to death; I should find fault with all  her suitors. But I should end by letting her marry whom she herself  loved. The one whom the daughter loves always seems the worst to the  father, you know. That is always so. So many family troubles come from  that.0d    0cSome are glad to sell their daughters, rather than marrying them  honourably.0d    Ah, so that was it!    0cSuch a thing, Liza, happens in those accursed families in which there  is neither love nor God,0d I retorted warmly, 0cand where there is no  love, there is no sense either. There are such families, it09s true, but  I am not speaking of them. You must have seen wickedness in your own  family, if you talk like that. Truly, you must have been unlucky. H09m!  ... that sort of thing mostly comes about through poverty.0d    0cAnd is it any better with the gentry? Even among the poor, honest  people who live happily?0d    0cH09m ... yes. Perhaps. Another thing, Liza, man is fond of reckoning up  his troubles, but does not count his joys. If he counted them up as he  ought, he would see that every lot has enough happiness provided for  it. And what if all goes well with the family, if the blessing of God  is upon it, if the husband is a good one, loves you, cherishes you,  never leaves you! There is happiness in such a family! Even sometimes  there is happiness in the midst of sorrow; and indeed sorrow is  everywhere. If you marry _you will find out for yourself_. But think of  the first years of married life with one you love: what happiness, what  happiness there sometimes is in it! And indeed it09s the ordinary thing.  In those early days even quarrels with one09s husband end happily. Some  women get up quarrels with their husbands just because they love them.  Indeed, I knew a woman like that: she seemed to say that because she  loved him, she would torment him and make him feel it. You know that  you may torment a man on purpose through love. Women are particularly  given to that, thinking to themselves 08I will love him so, I will make  so much of him afterwards, that it09s no sin to torment him a little  now.09 And all in the house rejoice in the sight of you, and you are  happy and gay and peaceful and honourable.... Then there are some women  who are jealous. If he went off anywhere04I knew one such woman, she  couldn09t restrain herself, but would jump up at night and run off on  the sly to find out where he was, whether he was with some other woman.  That09s a pity. And the woman knows herself it09s wrong, and her heart  fails her and she suffers, but she loves04it09s all through love. And how  sweet it is to make up after quarrels, to own herself in the wrong or  to forgive him! And they both are so happy all at once04as though they  had met anew, been married over again; as though their love had begun  afresh. And no one, no one should know what passes between husband and  wife if they love one another. And whatever quarrels there may be  between them they ought not to call in their own mother to judge  between them and tell tales of one another. They are their own judges.  Love is a holy mystery and ought to be hidden from all other eyes,  whatever happens. That makes it holier and better. They respect one  another more, and much is built on respect. And if once there has been  love, if they have been married for love, why should love pass away?  Surely one can keep it! It is rare that one cannot keep it. And if the  husband is kind and straightforward, why should not love last? The  first phase of married love will pass, it is true, but then there will  come a love that is better still. Then there will be the union of  souls, they will have everything in common, there will be no secrets  between them. And once they have children, the most difficult times  will seem to them happy, so long as there is love and courage. Even  toil will be a joy, you may deny yourself bread for your children and  even that will be a joy, They will love you for it afterwards; so you  are laying by for your future. As the children grow up you feel that  you are an example, a support for them; that even after you die your  children will always keep your thoughts and feelings, because they have  received them from you, they will take on your semblance and likeness.  So you see this is a great duty. How can it fail to draw the father and  mother nearer? People say it09s a trial to have children. Who says that?  It is heavenly happiness! Are you fond of little children, Liza? I am  awfully fond of them. You know04a little rosy baby boy at your bosom,  and what husband09s heart is not touched, seeing his wife nursing his  child! A plump little rosy baby, sprawling and snuggling, chubby little  hands and feet, clean tiny little nails, so tiny that it makes one  laugh to look at them; eyes that look as if they understand everything.  And while it sucks it clutches at your bosom with its little hand,  plays. When its father comes up, the child tears itself away from the  bosom, flings itself back, looks at its father, laughs, as though it  were fearfully funny, and falls to sucking again. Or it will bite its  mother09s breast when its little teeth are coming, while it looks  sideways at her with its little eyes as though to say, 08Look, I am  biting!09 Is not all that happiness when they are the three together,  husband, wife and child? One can forgive a great deal for the sake of  such moments. Yes, Liza, one must first learn to live oneself before  one blames others!0d    0cIt09s by pictures, pictures like that one must get at you,0d I thought  to myself, though I did speak with real feeling, and all at once I  flushed crimson. 0cWhat if she were suddenly to burst out laughing, what  should I do then?0d That idea drove me to fury. Towards the end of my  speech I really was excited, and now my vanity was somehow wounded. The  silence continued. I almost nudged her.    0cWhy are you040d she began and stopped. But I understood: there was a  quiver of something different in her voice, not abrupt, harsh and  unyielding as before, but something soft and shamefaced, so shamefaced  that I suddenly felt ashamed and guilty.    0cWhat?0d I asked, with tender curiosity.    0cWhy, you...0d    0cWhat?0d    0cWhy, you ... speak somehow like a book,0d she said, and again there was  a note of irony in her voice.    That remark sent a pang to my heart. It was not what I was expecting.    I did not understand that she was hiding her feelings under irony, that  this is usually the last refuge of modest and chaste-souled people when  the privacy of their soul is coarsely and intrusively invaded, and that  their pride makes them refuse to surrender till the last moment and  shrink from giving expression to their feelings before you. I ought to  have guessed the truth from the timidity with which she had repeatedly  approached her sarcasm, only bringing herself to utter it at last with  an effort. But I did not guess, and an evil feeling took possession of  me.    0cWait a bit!0d I thought.          VII      0cOh, hush, Liza! How can you talk about being like a book, when it  makes even me, an outsider, feel sick? Though I don09t look at it as an  outsider, for, indeed, it touches me to the heart.... Is it possible,  is it possible that you do not feel sick at being here yourself?  Evidently habit does wonders! God knows what habit can do with anyone.  Can you seriously think that you will never grow old, that you will  always be good-looking, and that they will keep you here for ever and  ever? I say nothing of the loathsomeness of the life here.... Though  let me tell you this about it04about your present life, I mean; here  though you are young now, attractive, nice, with soul and feeling, yet  you know as soon as I came to myself just now I felt at once sick at  being here with you! One can only come here when one is drunk. But if  you were anywhere else, living as good people live, I should perhaps be  more than attracted by you, should fall in love with you, should be  glad of a look from you, let alone a word; I should hang about your  door, should go down on my knees to you, should look upon you as my  betrothed and think it an honour to be allowed to. I should not dare to  have an impure thought about you. But here, you see, I know that I have  only to whistle and you have to come with me whether you like it or  not. I don09t consult your wishes, but you mine. The lowest labourer  hires himself as a workman, but he doesn09t make a slave of himself  altogether; besides, he knows that he will be free again presently. But  when are you free? Only think what you are giving up here? What is it  you are making a slave of? It is your soul, together with your body;  you are selling your soul which you have no right to dispose of! You  give your love to be outraged by every drunkard! Love! But that09s  everything, you know, it09s a priceless diamond, it09s a maiden09s  treasure, love04why, a man would be ready to give his soul, to face  death to gain that love. But how much is your love worth now? You are  sold, all of you, body and soul, and there is no need to strive for  love when you can have everything without love. And you know there is  no greater insult to a girl than that, do you understand? To be sure, I  have heard that they comfort you, poor fools, they let you have lovers  of your own here. But you know that09s simply a farce, that09s simply a  sham, it09s just laughing at you, and you are taken in by it! Why, do  you suppose he really loves you, that lover of yours? I don09t believe  it. How can he love you when he knows you may be called away from him  any minute? He would be a low fellow if he did! Will he have a grain of  respect for you? What have you in common with him? He laughs at you and  robs you04that is all his love amounts to! You are lucky if he does not  beat you. Very likely he does beat you, too. Ask him, if you have got  one, whether he will marry you. He will laugh in your face, if he  doesn09t spit in it or give you a blow04though maybe he is not worth a  bad halfpenny himself. And for what have you ruined your life, if you  come to think of it? For the coffee they give you to drink and the  plentiful meals? But with what object are they feeding you up? An  honest girl couldn09t swallow the food, for she would know what she was  being fed for. You are in debt here, and, of course, you will always be  in debt, and you will go on in debt to the end, till the visitors here  begin to scorn you. And that will soon happen, don09t rely upon your  youth04all that flies by express train here, you know. You will be  kicked out. And not simply kicked out; long before that she09ll begin  nagging at you, scolding you, abusing you, as though you had not  sacrificed your health for her, had not thrown away your youth and your  soul for her benefit, but as though you had ruined her, beggared her,  robbed her. And don09t expect anyone to take your part: the others, your  companions, will attack you, too, win her favour, for all are in  slavery here, and have lost all conscience and pity here long ago. They  have become utterly vile, and nothing on earth is viler, more  loathsome, and more insulting than their abuse. And you are laying down  everything here, unconditionally, youth and health and beauty and hope,  and at twenty-two you will look like a woman of five-and-thirty, and  you will be lucky if you are not diseased, pray to God for that! No  doubt you are thinking now that you have a gay time and no work to do!  Yet there is no work harder or more dreadful in the world or ever has  been. One would think that the heart alone would be worn out with  tears. And you won09t dare to say a word, not half a word when they  drive you away from here; you will go away as though you were to blame.  You will change to another house, then to a third, then somewhere else,  till you come down at last to the Haymarket. There you will be beaten  at every turn; that is good manners there, the visitors don09t know how  to be friendly without beating you. You don09t believe that it is so  hateful there? Go and look for yourself some time, you can see with  your own eyes. Once, one New Year09s Day, I saw a woman at a door. They  had turned her out as a joke, to give her a taste of the frost because  she had been crying so much, and they shut the door behind her. At nine  o09clock in the morning she was already quite drunk, dishevelled,  half-naked, covered with bruises, her face was powdered, but she had a  black-eye, blood was trickling from her nose and her teeth; some cabman  had just given her a drubbing. She was sitting on the stone steps, a  salt fish of some sort was in her hand; she was crying, wailing  something about her luck and beating with the fish on the steps, and  cabmen and drunken soldiers were crowding in the doorway taunting her.  You don09t believe that you will ever be like that? I should be sorry to  believe it, too, but how do you know; maybe ten years, eight years ago  that very woman with the salt fish came here fresh as a cherub,  innocent, pure, knowing no evil, blushing at every word. Perhaps she  was like you, proud, ready to take offence, not like the others;  perhaps she looked like a queen, and knew what happiness was in store  for the man who should love her and whom she should love. Do you see  how it ended? And what if at that very minute when she was beating on  the filthy steps with that fish, drunken and dishevelled04what if at  that very minute she recalled the pure early days in her father09s  house, when she used to go to school and the neighbour09s son watched  for her on the way, declaring that he would love her as long as he  lived, that he would devote his life to her, and when they vowed to  love one another for ever and be married as soon as they were grown up!  No, Liza, it would be happy for you if you were to die soon of  consumption in some corner, in some cellar like that woman just now. In  the hospital, do you say? You will be lucky if they take you, but what  if you are still of use to the madam here? Consumption is a queer  disease, it is not like fever. The patient goes on hoping till the last  minute and says he is all right. He deludes himself And that just suits  your madam. Don09t doubt it, that09s how it is; you have sold your soul,  and what is more you owe money, so you daren09t say a word. But when you  are dying, all will abandon you, all will turn away from you, for then  there will be nothing to get from you. What09s more, they will reproach  you for cumbering the place, for being so long over dying. However you  beg you won09t get a drink of water without abuse: 08Whenever are you  going off, you nasty hussy, you won09t let us sleep with your moaning,  you make the gentlemen sick.09 That09s true, I have heard such things  said myself. They will thrust you dying into the filthiest corner in  the cellar04in the damp and darkness; what will your thoughts be, lying  there alone? When you die, strange hands will lay you out, with  grumbling and impatience; no one will bless you, no one will sigh for  you, they only want to get rid of you as soon as may be; they will buy  a coffin, take you to the grave as they did that poor woman today, and  celebrate your memory at the tavern. In the grave, sleet, filth, wet  snow04no need to put themselves out for you0408Let her down, Vanuha; it09s  just like her luck04even here, she is head-foremost, the hussy. Shorten  the cord, you rascal.09 08It09s all right as it is.09 08All right, is it?  Why, she09s on her side! She was a fellow-creature, after all! But,  never mind, throw the earth on her.09 And they won09t care to waste much  time quarrelling over you. They will scatter the wet blue clay as quick  as they can and go off to the tavern ... and there your memory on earth  will end; other women have children to go to their graves, fathers,  husbands. While for you neither tear, nor sigh, nor remembrance; no one  in the whole world will ever come to you, your name will vanish from  the face of the earth04as though you had never existed, never been born  at all! Nothing but filth and mud, however you knock at your coffin lid  at night, when the dead arise, however you cry: 08Let me out, kind  people, to live in the light of day! My life was no life at all; my  life has been thrown away like a dish-clout; it was drunk away in the  tavern at the Haymarket; let me out, kind people, to live in the world  again.090d    And I worked myself up to such a pitch that I began to have a lump in  my throat myself, and ... and all at once I stopped, sat up in dismay  and, bending over apprehensively, began to listen with a beating heart.  I had reason to be troubled.    I had felt for some time that I was turning her soul upside down and  rending her heart, and04and the more I was convinced of it, the more  eagerly I desired to gain my object as quickly and as effectually as  possible. It was the exercise of my skill that carried me away; yet it  was not merely sport....    I knew I was speaking stiffly, artificially, even bookishly, in fact, I  could not speak except 0clike a book.0d But that did not trouble me: I  knew, I felt that I should be understood and that this very bookishness  might be an assistance. But now, having attained my effect, I was  suddenly panic-stricken. Never before had I witnessed such despair! She  was lying on her face, thrusting her face into the pillow and clutching  it in both hands. Her heart was being torn. Her youthful body was  shuddering all over as though in convulsions. Suppressed sobs rent her  bosom and suddenly burst out in weeping and wailing, then she pressed  closer into the pillow: she did not want anyone here, not a living  soul, to know of her anguish and her tears. She bit the pillow, bit her  hand till it bled (I saw that afterwards), or, thrusting her fingers  into her dishevelled hair, seemed rigid with the effort of restraint,  holding her breath and clenching her teeth. I began saying something,  begging her to calm herself, but felt that I did not dare; and all at  once, in a sort of cold shiver, almost in terror, began fumbling in the  dark, trying hurriedly to get dressed to go. It was dark; though I  tried my best I could not finish dressing quickly. Suddenly I felt a  box of matches and a candlestick with a whole candle in it. As soon as  the room was lighted up, Liza sprang up, sat up in bed, and with a  contorted face, with a half insane smile, looked at me almost  senselessly. I sat down beside her and took her hands; she came to  herself, made an impulsive movement towards me, would have caught hold  of me, but did not dare, and slowly bowed her head before me.    0cLiza, my dear, I was wrong ... forgive me, my dear,0d I began, but she  squeezed my hand in her fingers so tightly that I felt I was saying the  wrong thing and stopped.    0cThis is my address, Liza, come to me.0d    0cI will come,0d she answered resolutely, her head still bowed.    0cBut now I am going, good-bye ... till we meet again.0d    I got up; she, too, stood up and suddenly flushed all over, gave a  shudder, snatched up a shawl that was lying on a chair and muffled  herself in it to her chin. As she did this she gave another sickly  smile, blushed and looked at me strangely. I felt wretched; I was in  haste to get away04to disappear.    0cWait a minute,0d she said suddenly, in the passage just at the doorway,  stopping me with her hand on my overcoat. She put down the candle in  hot haste and ran off; evidently she had thought of something or wanted  to show me something. As she ran away she flushed, her eyes shone, and  there was a smile on her lips04what was the meaning of it? Against my  will I waited: she came back a minute later with an expression that  seemed to ask forgiveness for something. In fact, it was not the same  face, not the same look as the evening before: sullen, mistrustful and  obstinate. Her eyes now were imploring, soft, and at the same time  trustful, caressing, timid. The expression with which children look at  people they are very fond of, of whom they are asking a favour. Her  eyes were a light hazel, they were lovely eyes, full of life, and  capable of expressing love as well as sullen hatred.    Making no explanation, as though I, as a sort of higher being, must  understand everything without explanations, she held out a piece of  paper to me. Her whole face was positively beaming at that instant with  naive, almost childish, triumph. I unfolded it. It was a letter to her  from a medical student or someone of that sort04a very high-flown and  flowery, but extremely respectful, love-letter. I don09t recall the  words now, but I remember well that through the high-flown phrases  there was apparent a genuine feeling, which cannot be feigned. When I  had finished reading it I met her glowing, questioning, and childishly  impatient eyes fixed upon me. She fastened her eyes upon my face and  waited impatiently for what I should say. In a few words, hurriedly,  but with a sort of joy and pride, she explained to me that she had been  to a dance somewhere in a private house, a family of 0cvery nice people,  _who knew nothing_, absolutely nothing, for she had only come here so  lately and it had all happened ... and she hadn09t made up her mind to  stay and was certainly going away as soon as she had paid her debt...0d  and at that party there had been the student who had danced with her  all the evening. He had talked to her, and it turned out that he had  known her in old days at Riga when he was a child, they had played  together, but a very long time ago04and he knew her parents, but _about  this_ he knew nothing, nothing whatever, and had no suspicion! And the  day after the dance (three days ago) he had sent her that letter  through the friend with whom she had gone to the party ... and ...  well, that was all.    She dropped her shining eyes with a sort of bashfulness as she  finished.    The poor girl was keeping that student09s letter as a precious treasure,  and had run to fetch it, her only treasure, because she did not want me  to go away without knowing that she, too, was honestly and genuinely  loved; that she, too, was addressed respectfully. No doubt that letter  was destined to lie in her box and lead to nothing. But none the less,  I am certain that she would keep it all her life as a precious  treasure, as her pride and justification, and now at such a minute she  had thought of that letter and brought it with naive pride to raise  herself in my eyes that I might see, that I, too, might think well of  her. I said nothing, pressed her hand and went out. I so longed to get  away ... I walked all the way home, in spite of the fact that the  melting snow was still falling in heavy flakes. I was exhausted,  shattered, in bewilderment. But behind the bewilderment the truth was  already gleaming. The loathsome truth.          VIII      It was some time, however, before I consented to recognise that truth.  Waking up in the morning after some hours of heavy, leaden sleep, and  immediately realising all that had happened on the previous day, I was  positively amazed at my last night09s _sentimentality_ with Liza, at all  those 0coutcries of horror and pity.0d 0cTo think of having such an attack  of womanish hysteria, pah!0d I concluded. And what did I thrust my  address upon her for? What if she comes? Let her come, though; it  doesn09t matter.... But _obviously_, that was not now the chief and the  most important matter: I had to make haste and at all costs save my  reputation in the eyes of Zverkov and Simonov as quickly as possible;  that was the chief business. And I was so taken up that morning that I  actually forgot all about Liza.    First of all I had at once to repay what I had borrowed the day before  from Simonov. I resolved on a desperate measure: to borrow fifteen  roubles straight off from Anton Antonitch. As luck would have it he was  in the best of humours that morning, and gave it to me at once, on the  first asking. I was so delighted at this that, as I signed the IOU with  a swaggering air, I told him casually that the night before 0cI had been  keeping it up with some friends at the Htel de Paris; we were giving a  farewell party to a comrade, in fact, I might say a friend of my  childhood, and you know04a desperate rake, fearfully spoilt04of course,  he belongs to a good family, and has considerable means, a brilliant  career; he is witty, charming, a regular Lovelace, you understand; we  drank an extra 08half-dozen09 and ...0d    And it went off all right; all this was uttered very easily,  unconstrainedly and complacently.    On reaching home I promptly wrote to Simonov.    To this hour I am lost in admiration when I recall the truly  gentlemanly, good-humoured, candid tone of my letter. With tact and  good-breeding, and, above all, entirely without superfluous words, I  blamed myself for all that had happened. I defended myself, 0cif I  really may be allowed to defend myself,0d by alleging that being utterly  unaccustomed to wine, I had been intoxicated with the first glass,  which I said, I had drunk before they arrived, while I was waiting for  them at the Htel de Paris between five and six o09clock. I begged  Simonov09s pardon especially; I asked him to convey my explanations to  all the others, especially to Zverkov, whom 0cI seemed to remember as  though in a dream0d I had insulted. I added that I would have called  upon all of them myself, but my head ached, and besides I had not the  face to. I was particularly pleased with a certain lightness, almost  carelessness (strictly within the bounds of politeness, however), which  was apparent in my style, and better than any possible arguments, gave  them at once to understand that I took rather an independent view of  0call that unpleasantness last night0d; that I was by no means so utterly  crushed as you, my friends, probably imagine; but on the contrary,  looked upon it as a gentleman serenely respecting himself should look  upon it. 0cOn a young hero09s past no censure is cast!0d    0cThere is actually an aristocratic playfulness about it!0d I thought  admiringly, as I read over the letter. 0cAnd it09s all because I am an  intellectual and cultivated man! Another man in my place would not have  known how to extricate himself, but here I have got out of it and am as  jolly as ever again, and all because I am 08a cultivated and educated  man of our day.09 And, indeed, perhaps, everything was due to the wine  yesterday. H09m!0d ... No, it was not the wine. I did not drink anything  at all between five and six when I was waiting for them. I had lied to  Simonov; I had lied shamelessly; and indeed I wasn09t ashamed now....  Hang it all though, the great thing was that I was rid of it.    I put six roubles in the letter, sealed it up, and asked Apollon to  take it to Simonov. When he learned that there was money in the letter,  Apollon became more respectful and agreed to take it. Towards evening I  went out for a walk. My head was still aching and giddy after  yesterday. But as evening came on and the twilight grew denser, my  impressions and, following them, my thoughts, grew more and more  different and confused. Something was not dead within me, in the depths  of my heart and conscience it would not die, and it showed itself in  acute depression. For the most part I jostled my way through the most  crowded business streets, along Myeshtchansky Street, along Sadovy  Street and in Yusupov Garden. I always liked particularly sauntering  along these streets in the dusk, just when there were crowds of working  people of all sorts going home from their daily work, with faces  looking cross with anxiety. What I liked was just that cheap bustle,  that bare prose. On this occasion the jostling of the streets irritated  me more than ever, I could not make out what was wrong with me, I could  not find the clue, something seemed rising up continually in my soul,  painfully, and refusing to be appeased. I returned home completely  upset, it was just as though some crime were lying on my conscience.    The thought that Liza was coming worried me continually. It seemed  queer to me that of all my recollections of yesterday this tormented  me, as it were, especially, as it were, quite separately. Everything  else I had quite succeeded in forgetting by the evening; I dismissed it  all and was still perfectly satisfied with my letter to Simonov. But on  this point I was not satisfied at all. It was as though I were worried  only by Liza. 0cWhat if she comes,0d I thought incessantly, 0cwell, it  doesn09t matter, let her come! H09m! it09s horrid that she should see, for  instance, how I live. Yesterday I seemed such a hero to her, while now,  h09m! It09s horrid, though, that I have let myself go so, the room looks  like a beggar09s. And I brought myself to go out to dinner in such a  suit! And my American leather sofa with the stuffing sticking out. And  my dressing-gown, which will not cover me, such tatters, and she will  see all this and she will see Apollon. That beast is certain to insult  her. He will fasten upon her in order to be rude to me. And I, of  course, shall be panic-stricken as usual, I shall begin bowing and  scraping before her and pulling my dressing-gown round me, I shall  begin smiling, telling lies. Oh, the beastliness! And it isn09t the  beastliness of it that matters most! There is something more important,  more loathsome, viler! Yes, viler! And to put on that dishonest lying  mask again! ...0d    When I reached that thought I fired up all at once.    0cWhy dishonest? How dishonest? I was speaking sincerely last night. I  remember there was real feeling in me, too. What I wanted was to excite  an honourable feeling in her.... Her crying was a good thing, it will  have a good effect.0d    Yet I could not feel at ease. All that evening, even when I had come  back home, even after nine o09clock, when I calculated that Liza could  not possibly come, still she haunted me, and what was worse, she came  back to my mind always in the same position. One moment out of all that  had happened last night stood vividly before my imagination; the moment  when I struck a match and saw her pale, distorted face, with its look  of torture. And what a pitiful, what an unnatural, what a distorted  smile she had at that moment! But I did not know then, that fifteen  years later I should still in my imagination see Liza, always with the  pitiful, distorted, inappropriate smile which was on her face at that  minute.    Next day I was ready again to look upon it all as nonsense, due to  over-excited nerves, and, above all, as _exaggerated_. I was always  conscious of that weak point of mine, and sometimes very much afraid of  it. 0cI exaggerate everything, that is where I go wrong,0d I repeated to  myself every hour. But, however, 0cLiza will very likely come all the  same,0d was the refrain with which all my reflections ended. I was so  uneasy that I sometimes flew into a fury: 0cShe09ll come, she is certain  to come!0d I cried, running about the room, 0cif not today, she will come  tomorrow; she09ll find me out! The damnable romanticism of these pure  hearts! Oh, the vileness04oh, the silliness04oh, the stupidity of these  08wretched sentimental souls!09 Why, how fail to understand? How could  one fail to understand? ...0d    But at this point I stopped short, and in great confusion, indeed.    And how few, how few words, I thought, in passing, were needed; how  little of the idyllic (and affectedly, bookishly, artificially idyllic  too) had sufficed to turn a whole human life at once according to my  will. That09s virginity, to be sure! Freshness of soil!    At times a thought occurred to me, to go to her, 0cto tell her all,0d and  beg her not to come to me. But this thought stirred such wrath in me  that I believed I should have crushed that 0cdamned0d Liza if she had  chanced to be near me at the time. I should have insulted her, have  spat at her, have turned her out, have struck her!    One day passed, however, another and another; she did not come and I  began to grow calmer. I felt particularly bold and cheerful after nine  o09clock, I even sometimes began dreaming, and rather sweetly: I, for  instance, became the salvation of Liza, simply through her coming to me  and my talking to her.... I develop her, educate her. Finally, I notice  that she loves me, loves me passionately. I pretend not to understand  (I don09t know, however, why I pretend, just for effect, perhaps). At  last all confusion, transfigured, trembling and sobbing, she flings  herself at my feet and says that I am her saviour, and that she loves  me better than anything in the world. I am amazed, but.... 0cLiza,0d I  say, 0ccan you imagine that I have not noticed your love? I saw it all,  I divined it, but I did not dare to approach you first, because I had  an influence over you and was afraid that you would force yourself,  from gratitude, to respond to my love, would try to rouse in your heart  a feeling which was perhaps absent, and I did not wish that ... because  it would be tyranny ... it would be indelicate (in short, I launch off  at that point into European, inexplicably lofty subtleties a la George  Sand), but now, now you are mine, you are my creation, you are pure,  you are good, you are my noble wife.    08Into my house come bold and free,  Its rightful mistress there to be09.0d      Then we begin living together, go abroad and so on, and so on. In fact,  in the end it seemed vulgar to me myself, and I began putting out my  tongue at myself.    Besides, they won09t let her out, 0cthe hussy!0d I thought. They don09t let  them go out very readily, especially in the evening (for some reason I  fancied she would come in the evening, and at seven o09clock precisely).  Though she did say she was not altogether a slave there yet, and had  certain rights; so, h09m! Damn it all, she will come, she is sure to  come!    It was a good thing, in fact, that Apollon distracted my attention at  that time by his rudeness. He drove me beyond all patience! He was the  bane of my life, the curse laid upon me by Providence. We had been  squabbling continually for years, and I hated him. My God, how I hated  him! I believe I had never hated anyone in my life as I hated him,  especially at some moments. He was an elderly, dignified man, who  worked part of his time as a tailor. But for some unknown reason he  despised me beyond all measure, and looked down upon me insufferably.  Though, indeed, he looked down upon everyone. Simply to glance at that  flaxen, smoothly brushed head, at the tuft of hair he combed up on his  forehead and oiled with sunflower oil, at that dignified mouth,  compressed into the shape of the letter V, made one feel one was  confronting a man who never doubted of himself. He was a pedant, to the  most extreme point, the greatest pedant I had met on earth, and with  that had a vanity only befitting Alexander of Macedon. He was in love  with every button on his coat, every nail on his fingers04absolutely in  love with them, and he looked it! In his behaviour to me he was a  perfect tyrant, he spoke very little to me, and if he chanced to glance  at me he gave me a firm, majestically self-confident and invariably  ironical look that drove me sometimes to fury. He did his work with the  air of doing me the greatest favour, though he did scarcely anything  for me, and did not, indeed, consider himself bound to do anything.  There could be no doubt that he looked upon me as the greatest fool on  earth, and that 0che did not get rid of me0d was simply that he could get  wages from me every month. He consented to do nothing for me for seven  roubles a month. Many sins should be forgiven me for what I suffered  from him. My hatred reached such a point that sometimes his very step  almost threw me into convulsions. What I loathed particularly was his  lisp. His tongue must have been a little too long or something of that  sort, for he continually lisped, and seemed to be very proud of it,  imagining that it greatly added to his dignity. He spoke in a slow,  measured tone, with his hands behind his back and his eyes fixed on the  ground. He maddened me particularly when he read aloud the psalms to  himself behind his partition. Many a battle I waged over that reading!  But he was awfully fond of reading aloud in the evenings, in a slow,  even, sing-song voice, as though over the dead. It is interesting that  that is how he has ended: he hires himself out to read the psalms over  the dead, and at the same time he kills rats and makes blacking. But at  that time I could not get rid of him, it was as though he were  chemically combined with my existence. Besides, nothing would have  induced him to consent to leave me. I could not live in furnished  lodgings: my lodging was my private solitude, my shell, my cave, in  which I concealed myself from all mankind, and Apollon seemed to me,  for some reason, an integral part of that flat, and for seven years I  could not turn him away.    To be two or three days behind with his wages, for instance, was  impossible. He would have made such a fuss, I should not have known  where to hide my head. But I was so exasperated with everyone during  those days, that I made up my mind for some reason and with some object  to _punish_ Apollon and not to pay him for a fortnight the wages that  were owing him. I had for a long time04for the last two years04been  intending to do this, simply in order to teach him not to give himself  airs with me, and to show him that if I liked I could withhold his  wages. I purposed to say nothing to him about it, and was purposely  silent indeed, in order to score off his pride and force him to be the  first to speak of his wages. Then I would take the seven roubles out of  a drawer, show him I have the money put aside on purpose, but that I  won09t, I won09t, I simply won09t pay him his wages, I won09t just because  that is 0cwhat I wish,0d because 0cI am master, and it is for me to  decide,0d because he has been disrespectful, because he has been rude;  but if he were to ask respectfully I might be softened and give it to  him, otherwise he might wait another fortnight, another three weeks, a  whole month....    But angry as I was, yet he got the better of me. I could not hold out  for four days. He began as he always did begin in such cases, for there  had been such cases already, there had been attempts (and it may be  observed I knew all this beforehand, I knew his nasty tactics by  heart). He would begin by fixing upon me an exceedingly severe stare,  keeping it up for several minutes at a time, particularly on meeting me  or seeing me out of the house. If I held out and pretended not to  notice these stares, he would, still in silence, proceed to further  tortures. All at once, _ propos_ of nothing, he would walk softly and  smoothly into my room, when I was pacing up and down or reading, stand  at the door, one hand behind his back and one foot behind the other,  and fix upon me a stare more than severe, utterly contemptuous. If I  suddenly asked him what he wanted, he would make me no answer, but  continue staring at me persistently for some seconds, then, with a  peculiar compression of his lips and a most significant air,  deliberately turn round and deliberately go back to his room. Two hours  later he would come out again and again present himself before me in  the same way. It had happened that in my fury I did not even ask him  what he wanted, but simply raised my head sharply and imperiously and  began staring back at him. So we stared at one another for two minutes;  at last he turned with deliberation and dignity and went back again for  two hours.    If I were still not brought to reason by all this, but persisted in my  revolt, he would suddenly begin sighing while he looked at me, long,  deep sighs as though measuring by them the depths of my moral  degradation, and, of course, it ended at last by his triumphing  completely: I raged and shouted, but still was forced to do what he  wanted.    This time the usual staring manoeuvres had scarcely begun when I lost  my temper and flew at him in a fury. I was irritated beyond endurance  apart from him.    0cStay,0d I cried, in a frenzy, as he was slowly and silently turning,  with one hand behind his back, to go to his room. 0cStay! Come back,  come back, I tell you!0d and I must have bawled so unnaturally, that he  turned round and even looked at me with some wonder. However, he  persisted in saying nothing, and that infuriated me.    0cHow dare you come and look at me like that without being sent for?  Answer!0d    After looking at me calmly for half a minute, he began turning round  again.    0cStay!0d I roared, running up to him, 0cdon09t stir! There. Answer, now:  what did you come in to look at?0d    0cIf you have any order to give me it09s my duty to carry it out,0d he  answered, after another silent pause, with a slow, measured lisp,  raising his eyebrows and calmly twisting his head from one side to  another, all this with exasperating composure.    0cThat09s not what I am asking you about, you torturer!0d I shouted,  turning crimson with anger. 0cI09ll tell you why you came here myself:  you see, I don09t give you your wages, you are so proud you don09t want  to bow down and ask for it, and so you come to punish me with your  stupid stares, to worry me and you have no sus-pic-ion how stupid it  is04stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid! ...0d    He would have turned round again without a word, but I seized him.    0cListen,0d I shouted to him. 0cHere09s the money, do you see, here it is,0d  (I took it out of the table drawer); 0chere09s the seven roubles  complete, but you are not going to have it, you ... are ... not ...  going ... to ... have it until you come respectfully with bowed head to  beg my pardon. Do you hear?0d    0cThat cannot be,0d he answered, with the most unnatural self-confidence.    0cIt shall be so,0d I said, 0cI give you my word of honour, it shall be!0d    0cAnd there09s nothing for me to beg your pardon for,0d he went on, as  though he had not noticed my exclamations at all. 0cWhy, besides, you  called me a 08torturer,09 for which I can summon you at the  police-station at any time for insulting behaviour.0d    0cGo, summon me,0d I roared, 0cgo at once, this very minute, this very  second! You are a torturer all the same! a torturer!0d    But he merely looked at me, then turned, and regardless of my loud  calls to him, he walked to his room with an even step and without  looking round.    0cIf it had not been for Liza nothing of this would have happened,0d I  decided inwardly. Then, after waiting a minute, I went myself behind  his screen with a dignified and solemn air, though my heart was beating  slowly and violently.    0cApollon,0d I said quietly and emphatically, though I was breathless,  0cgo at once without a minute09s delay and fetch the police-officer.0d    He had meanwhile settled himself at his table, put on his spectacles  and taken up some sewing. But, hearing my order, he burst into a  guffaw.    0cAt once, go this minute! Go on, or else you can09t imagine what will  happen.0d    0cYou are certainly out of your mind,0d he observed, without even raising  his head, lisping as deliberately as ever and threading his needle.  0cWhoever heard of a man sending for the police against himself? And as  for being frightened04you are upsetting yourself about nothing, for  nothing will come of it.0d    0cGo!0d I shrieked, clutching him by the shoulder. I felt I should strike  him in a minute.    But I did not notice the door from the passage softly and slowly open  at that instant and a figure come in, stop short, and begin staring at  us in perplexity I glanced, nearly swooned with shame, and rushed back  to my room. There, clutching at my hair with both hands, I leaned my  head against the wall and stood motionless in that position.    Two minutes later I heard Apollon09s deliberate footsteps. 0cThere is  some woman asking for you,0d he said, looking at me with peculiar  severity. Then he stood aside and let in Liza. He would not go away,  but stared at us sarcastically.    0cGo away, go away,0d I commanded in desperation. At that moment my clock  began whirring and wheezing and struck seven.          IX      0cInto my house come bold and free,  Its rightful mistress there to be.0d      I stood before her crushed, crestfallen, revoltingly confused, and I  believe I smiled as I did my utmost to wrap myself in the skirts of my  ragged wadded dressing-gown04exactly as I had imagined the scene not  long before in a fit of depression. After standing over us for a couple  of minutes Apollon went away, but that did not make me more at ease.  What made it worse was that she, too, was overwhelmed with confusion,  more so, in fact, than I should have expected. At the sight of me, of  course.    0cSit down,0d I said mechanically, moving a chair up to the table, and I  sat down on the sofa. She obediently sat down at once and gazed at me  open-eyed, evidently expecting something from me at once. This na\\\\xafvet  of expectation drove me to fury, but I restrained myself.    She ought to have tried not to notice, as though everything had been as  usual, while instead of that, she ... and I dimly felt that I should  make her pay dearly for _all this_.    0cYou have found me in a strange position, Liza,0d I began, stammering  and knowing that this was the wrong way to begin. 0cNo, no, don09t  imagine anything,0d I cried, seeing that she had suddenly flushed. 0cI am  not ashamed of my poverty.... On the contrary, I look with pride on my  poverty. I am poor but honourable.... One can be poor and honourable,0d  I muttered. 0cHowever ... would you like tea?....0d    0cNo,0d she was beginning.    0cWait a minute.0d    I leapt up and ran to Apollon. I had to get out of the room somehow.    0cApollon,0d I whispered in feverish haste, flinging down before him the  seven roubles which had remained all the time in my clenched fist,  0chere are your wages, you see I give them to you; but for that you must  come to my rescue: bring me tea and a dozen rusks from the restaurant.  If you won09t go, you09ll make me a miserable man! You don09t know what  this woman is.... This is04everything! You may be imagining  something.... But you don09t know what that woman is! ...0d    Apollon, who had already sat down to his work and put on his spectacles  again, at first glanced askance at the money without speaking or  putting down his needle; then, without paying the slightest attention  to me or making any answer, he went on busying himself with his needle,  which he had not yet threaded. I waited before him for three minutes  with my arms crossed _ la Napolon_. My temples were moist with sweat.  I was pale, I felt it. But, thank God, he must have been moved to pity,  looking at me. Having threaded his needle he deliberately got up from  his seat, deliberately moved back his chair, deliberately took off his  spectacles, deliberately counted the money, and finally asking me over  his shoulder: 0cShall I get a whole portion?0d deliberately walked out of  the room. As I was going back to Liza, the thought occurred to me on  the way: shouldn09t I run away just as I was in my dressing-gown, no  matter where, and then let happen what would?    I sat down again. She looked at me uneasily. For some minutes we were  silent.    0cI will kill him,0d I shouted suddenly, striking the table with my fist  so that the ink spurted out of the inkstand.    0cWhat are you saying!0d she cried, starting.    0cI will kill him! kill him!0d I shrieked, suddenly striking the table in  absolute frenzy, and at the same time fully understanding how stupid it  was to be in such a frenzy. 0cYou don09t know, Liza, what that torturer  is to me. He is my torturer.... He has gone now to fetch some rusks; he  ...0d    And suddenly I burst into tears. It was an hysterical attack. How  ashamed I felt in the midst of my sobs; but still I could not restrain  them.    She was frightened.    0cWhat is the matter? What is wrong?0d she cried, fussing about me.    0cWater, give me water, over there!0d I muttered in a faint voice, though  I was inwardly conscious that I could have got on very well without  water and without muttering in a faint voice. But I was, what is  called, _putting it on_, to save appearances, though the attack was a  genuine one.    She gave me water, looking at me in bewilderment. At that moment  Apollon brought in the tea. It suddenly seemed to me that this  commonplace, prosaic tea was horribly undignified and paltry after all  that had happened, and I blushed crimson. Liza looked at Apollon with  positive alarm. He went out without a glance at either of us.    0cLiza, do you despise me?0d I asked, looking at her fixedly, trembling  with impatience to know what she was thinking.    She was confused, and did not know what to answer.    0cDrink your tea,0d I said to her angrily. I was angry with myself, but,  of course, it was she who would have to pay for it. A horrible spite  against her suddenly surged up in my heart; I believe I could have  killed her. To revenge myself on her I swore inwardly not to say a word  to her all the time. 0cShe is the cause of it all,0d I thought.    Our silence lasted for five minutes. The tea stood on the table; we did  not touch it. I had got to the point of purposely refraining from  beginning in order to embarrass her further; it was awkward for her to  begin alone. Several times she glanced at me with mournful perplexity.  I was obstinately silent. I was, of course, myself the chief sufferer,  because I was fully conscious of the disgusting meanness of my spiteful  stupidity, and yet at the same time I could not restrain myself.    0cI want to... get away ... from there altogether,0d she began, to break  the silence in some way, but, poor girl, that was just what she ought  not to have spoken about at such a stupid moment to a man so stupid as  I was. My heart positively ached with pity for her tactless and  unnecessary straightforwardness. But something hideous at once stifled  all compassion in me; it even provoked me to greater venom. I did not  care what happened. Another five minutes passed.    0cPerhaps I am in your way,0d she began timidly, hardly audibly, and was  getting up.    But as soon as I saw this first impulse of wounded dignity I positively  trembled with spite, and at once burst out.    0cWhy have you come to me, tell me that, please?0d I began, gasping for  breath and regardless of logical connection in my words. I longed to  have it all out at once, at one burst; I did not even trouble how to  begin. 0cWhy have you come? Answer, answer,0d I cried, hardly knowing  what I was doing. 0cI09ll tell you, my good girl, why you have come.  You09ve come because I talked sentimental stuff to you then. So now you  are soft as butter and longing for fine sentiments again. So you may as  well know that I was laughing at you then. And I am laughing at you  now. Why are you shuddering? Yes, I was laughing at you! I had been  insulted just before, at dinner, by the fellows who came that evening  before me. I came to you, meaning to thrash one of them, an officer;  but I didn09t succeed, I didn09t find him; I had to avenge the insult on  someone to get back my own again; you turned up, I vented my spleen on  you and laughed at you. I had been humiliated, so I wanted to  humiliate; I had been treated like a rag, so I wanted to show my  power.... That09s what it was, and you imagined I had come there on  purpose to save you. Yes? You imagined that? You imagined that?0d    I knew that she would perhaps be muddled and not take it all in  exactly, but I knew, too, that she would grasp the gist of it, very  well indeed. And so, indeed, she did. She turned white as a  handkerchief, tried to say something, and her lips worked painfully;  but she sank on a chair as though she had been felled by an axe. And  all the time afterwards she listened to me with her lips parted and her  eyes wide open, shuddering with awful terror. The cynicism, the  cynicism of my words overwhelmed her....    0cSave you!0d I went on, jumping up from my chair and running up and down  the room before her. 0cSave you from what? But perhaps I am worse than  you myself. Why didn09t you throw it in my teeth when I was giving you  that sermon: 08But what did you come here yourself for? was it to read  us a sermon?09 Power, power was what I wanted then, sport was what I  wanted, I wanted to wring out your tears, your humiliation, your  hysteria04that was what I wanted then! Of course, I couldn09t keep it up  then, because I am a wretched creature, I was frightened, and, the  devil knows why, gave you my address in my folly. Afterwards, before I  got home, I was cursing and swearing at you because of that address, I  hated you already because of the lies I had told you. Because I only  like playing with words, only dreaming, but, do you know, what I really  want is that you should all go to hell. That is what I want. I want  peace; yes, I09d sell the whole world for a farthing, straight off, so  long as I was left in peace. Is the world to go to pot, or am I to go  without my tea? I say that the world may go to pot for me so long as I  always get my tea. Did you know that, or not? Well, anyway, I know that  I am a blackguard, a scoundrel, an egoist, a sluggard. Here I have been  shuddering for the last three days at the thought of your coming. And  do you know what has worried me particularly for these three days? That  I posed as such a hero to you, and now you would see me in a wretched  torn dressing-gown, beggarly, loathsome. I told you just now that I was  not ashamed of my poverty; so you may as well know that I am ashamed of  it; I am more ashamed of it than of anything, more afraid of it than of  being found out if I were a thief, because I am as vain as though I had  been skinned and the very air blowing on me hurt. Surely by now you  must realise that I shall never forgive you for having found me in this  wretched dressing-gown, just as I was flying at Apollon like a spiteful  cur. The saviour, the former hero, was flying like a mangy, unkempt  sheep-dog at his lackey, and the lackey was jeering at him! And I shall  never forgive you for the tears I could not help shedding before you  just now, like some silly woman put to shame! And for what I am  confessing to you now, I shall never forgive you either! Yes04you must  answer for it all because you turned up like this, because I am a  blackguard, because I am the nastiest, stupidest, absurdest and most  envious of all the worms on earth, who are not a bit better than I am,  but, the devil knows why, are never put to confusion; while I shall  always be insulted by every louse, that is my doom! And what is it to  me that you don09t understand a word of this! And what do I care, what  do I care about you, and whether you go to ruin there or not? Do you  understand? How I shall hate you now after saying this, for having been  here and listening. Why, it09s not once in a lifetime a man speaks out  like this, and then it is in hysterics! ... What more do you want? Why  do you still stand confronting me, after all this? Why are you worrying  me? Why don09t you go?0d    But at this point a strange thing happened. I was so accustomed to  think and imagine everything from books, and to picture everything in  the world to myself just as I had made it up in my dreams beforehand,  that I could not all at once take in this strange circumstance. What  happened was this: Liza, insulted and crushed by me, understood a great  deal more than I imagined. She understood from all this what a woman  understands first of all, if she feels genuine love, that is, that I  was myself unhappy.    The frightened and wounded expression on her face was followed first by  a look of sorrowful perplexity. When I began calling myself a scoundrel  and a blackguard and my tears flowed (the tirade was accompanied  throughout by tears) her whole face worked convulsively. She was on the  point of getting up and stopping me; when I finished she took no notice  of my shouting: 0cWhy are you here, why don09t you go away?0d but realised  only that it must have been very bitter to me to say all this. Besides,  she was so crushed, poor girl; she considered herself infinitely  beneath me; how could she feel anger or resentment? She suddenly leapt  up from her chair with an irresistible impulse and held out her hands,  yearning towards me, though still timid and not daring to stir.... At  this point there was a revulsion in my heart too. Then she suddenly  rushed to me, threw her arms round me and burst into tears. I, too,  could not restrain myself, and sobbed as I never had before.    0cThey won09t let me ... I can09t be good!0d I managed to articulate; then  I went to the sofa, fell on it face downwards, and sobbed on it for a  quarter of an hour in genuine hysterics. She came close to me, put her  arms round me and stayed motionless in that position. But the trouble  was that the hysterics could not go on for ever, and (I am writing the  loathsome truth) lying face downwards on the sofa with my face thrust  into my nasty leather pillow, I began by degrees to be aware of a  far-away, involuntary but irresistible feeling that it would be awkward  now for me to raise my head and look Liza straight in the face. Why was  I ashamed? I don09t know, but I was ashamed. The thought, too, came into  my overwrought brain that our parts now were completely changed, that  she was now the heroine, while I was just a crushed and humiliated  creature as she had been before me that night04four days before.... And  all this came into my mind during the minutes I was lying on my face on  the sofa.    My God! surely I was not envious of her then.    I don09t know, to this day I cannot decide, and at the time, of course,  I was still less able to understand what I was feeling than now. I  cannot get on without domineering and tyrannising over someone, but ...  there is no explaining anything by reasoning and so it is useless to  reason.    I conquered myself, however, and raised my head; I had to do so sooner  or later ... and I am convinced to this day that it was just because I  was ashamed to look at her that another feeling was suddenly kindled  and flamed up in my heart ... a feeling of mastery and possession. My  eyes gleamed with passion, and I gripped her hands tightly. How I hated  her and how I was drawn to her at that minute! The one feeling  intensified the other. It was almost like an act of vengeance. At first  there was a look of amazement, even of terror on her face, but only for  one instant. She warmly and rapturously embraced me.          X      A quarter of an hour later I was rushing up and down the room in  frenzied impatience, from minute to minute I went up to the screen and  peeped through the crack at Liza. She was sitting on the ground with  her head leaning against the bed, and must have been crying. But she  did not go away, and that irritated me. This time she understood it  all. I had insulted her finally, but ... there09s no need to describe  it. She realised that my outburst of passion had been simply revenge, a  fresh humiliation, and that to my earlier, almost causeless hatred was  added now a _personal hatred_, born of envy.... Though I do not  maintain positively that she understood all this distinctly; but she  certainly did fully understand that I was a despicable man, and what  was worse, incapable of loving her.    I know I shall be told that this is incredible04but it is incredible to  be as spiteful and stupid as I was; it may be added that it was strange  I should not love her, or at any rate, appreciate her love. Why is it  strange? In the first place, by then I was incapable of love, for I  repeat, with me loving meant tyrannising and showing my moral  superiority. I have never in my life been able to imagine any other  sort of love, and have nowadays come to the point of sometimes thinking  that love really consists in the right04freely given by the beloved  object04to tyrannise over her.    Even in my underground dreams I did not imagine love except as a  struggle. I began it always with hatred and ended it with moral  subjugation, and afterwards I never knew what to do with the subjugated  object. And what is there to wonder at in that, since I had succeeded  in so corrupting myself, since I was so out of touch with 0creal life,0d  as to have actually thought of reproaching her, and putting her to  shame for having come to me to hear 0cfine sentiments0d; and did not even  guess that she had come not to hear fine sentiments, but to love me,  because to a woman all reformation, all salvation from any sort of  ruin, and all moral renewal is included in love and can only show  itself in that form.    I did not hate her so much, however, when I was running about the room  and peeping through the crack in the screen. I was only insufferably  oppressed by her being here. I wanted her to disappear. I wanted  0cpeace,0d to be left alone in my underground world. Real life oppressed  me with its novelty so much that I could hardly breathe.    But several minutes passed and she still remained, without stirring, as  though she were unconscious. I had the shamelessness to tap softly at  the screen as though to remind her.... She started, sprang up, and flew  to seek her kerchief, her hat, her coat, as though making her escape  from me.... Two minutes later she came from behind the screen and  looked with heavy eyes at me. I gave a spiteful grin, which was forced,  however, to _keep up appearances_, and I turned away from her eyes.    0cGood-bye,0d she said, going towards the door.    I ran up to her, seized her hand, opened it, thrust something in it and  closed it again. Then I turned at once and dashed away in haste to the  other corner of the room to avoid seeing, anyway....    I did mean a moment since to tell a lie04to write that I did this  accidentally, not knowing what I was doing through foolishness, through  losing my head. But I don09t want to lie, and so I will say straight out  that I opened her hand and put the money in it ... from spite. It came  into my head to do this while I was running up and down the room and  she was sitting behind the screen. But this I can say for certain:  though I did that cruel thing purposely, it was not an impulse from the  heart, but came from my evil brain. This cruelty was so affected, so  purposely made up, so completely a product of the brain, of books, that  I could not even keep it up a minute04first I dashed away to avoid  seeing her, and then in shame and despair rushed after Liza. I opened  the door in the passage and began listening.    0cLiza! Liza!0d I cried on the stairs, but in a low voice, not boldly.  There was no answer, but I fancied I heard her footsteps, lower down on  the stairs.    0cLiza!0d I cried, more loudly.    No answer. But at that minute I heard the stiff outer glass door open  heavily with a creak and slam violently; the sound echoed up the  stairs.    She had gone. I went back to my room in hesitation. I felt horribly  oppressed.    I stood still at the table, beside the chair on which she had sat and  looked aimlessly before me. A minute passed, suddenly I started;  straight before me on the table I saw.... In short, I saw a crumpled  blue five-rouble note, the one I had thrust into her hand a minute  before. It was the same note; it could be no other, there was no other  in the flat. So she had managed to fling it from her hand on the table  at the moment when I had dashed into the further corner.    Well! I might have expected that she would do that. Might I have  expected it? No, I was such an egoist, I was so lacking in respect for  my fellow-creatures that I could not even imagine she would do so. I  could not endure it. A minute later I flew like a madman to dress,  flinging on what I could at random and ran headlong after her. She  could not have got two hundred paces away when I ran out into the  street.    It was a still night and the snow was coming down in masses and falling  almost perpendicularly, covering the pavement and the empty street as  though with a pillow. There was no one in the street, no sound was to  be heard. The street lamps gave a disconsolate and useless glimmer. I  ran two hundred paces to the cross-roads and stopped short.    Where had she gone? And why was I running after her?    Why? To fall down before her, to sob with remorse, to kiss her feet, to  entreat her forgiveness! I longed for that, my whole breast was being  rent to pieces, and never, never shall I recall that minute with  indifference. But04what for? I thought. Should I not begin to hate her,  perhaps, even tomorrow, just because I had kissed her feet today?  Should I give her happiness? Had I not recognised that day, for the  hundredth time, what I was worth? Should I not torture her?    I stood in the snow, gazing into the troubled darkness and pondered  this.    0cAnd will it not be better?0d I mused fantastically, afterwards at home,  stifling the living pang of my heart with fantastic dreams. 0cWill it  not be better that she should keep the resentment of the insult for  ever? Resentment04why, it is purification; it is a most stinging and  painful consciousness! Tomorrow I should have defiled her soul and have  exhausted her heart, while now the feeling of insult will never die in  her heart, and however loathsome the filth awaiting her04the feeling of  insult will elevate and purify her ... by hatred ... h09m! ... perhaps,  too, by forgiveness.... Will all that make things easier for her  though? ...0d    And, indeed, I will ask on my own account here, an idle question: which  is better04cheap happiness or exalted sufferings? Well, which is better?    So I dreamed as I sat at home that evening, almost dead with the pain  in my soul. Never had I endured such suffering and remorse, yet could  there have been the faintest doubt when I ran out from my lodging that  I should turn back half-way? I never met Liza again and I have heard  nothing of her. I will add, too, that I remained for a long time  afterwards pleased with the phrase about the benefit from resentment  and hatred in spite of the fact that I almost fell ill from misery.      Even now, so many years later, all this is somehow a very evil memory.  I have many evil memories now, but ... hadn09t I better end my 0cNotes0d  here? I believe I made a mistake in beginning to write them, anyway I  have felt ashamed all the time I09ve been writing this story; so it09s  hardly literature so much as a corrective punishment. Why, to tell long  stories, showing how I have spoiled my life through morally rotting in  my corner, through lack of fitting environment, through divorce from  real life, and rankling spite in my underground world, would certainly  not be interesting; a novel needs a hero, and all the traits for an  anti-hero are _expressly_ gathered together here, and what matters  most, it all produces an unpleasant impression, for we are all divorced  from life, we are all cripples, every one of us, more or less. We are  so divorced from it that we feel at once a sort of loathing for real  life, and so cannot bear to be reminded of it. Why, we have come almost  to looking upon real life as an effort, almost as hard work, and we are  all privately agreed that it is better in books. And why do we fuss and  fume sometimes? Why are we perverse and ask for something else? We  don09t know what ourselves. It would be the worse for us if our petulant  prayers were answered. Come, try, give any one of us, for instance, a  little more independence, untie our hands, widen the spheres of our  activity, relax the control and we ... yes, I assure you ... we should  be begging to be under control again at once. I know that you will very  likely be angry with me for that, and will begin shouting and stamping.  Speak for yourself, you will say, and for your miseries in your  underground holes, and don09t dare to say all of us04excuse me,  gentlemen, I am not justifying myself with that 0call of us.0d As for  what concerns me in particular I have only in my life carried to an  extreme what you have not dared to carry halfway, and what09s more, you  have taken your cowardice for good sense, and have found comfort in  deceiving yourselves. So that perhaps, after all, there is more life in  me than in you. Look into it more carefully! Why, we don09t even know  what living means now, what it is, and what it is called? Leave us  alone without books and we shall be lost and in confusion at once. We  shall not know what to join on to, what to cling to, what to love and  what to hate, what to respect and what to despise. We are oppressed at  being men04men with a real individual body and blood, we are ashamed of  it, we think it a disgrace and try to contrive to be some sort of  impossible generalised man. We are stillborn, and for generations past  have been begotten, not by living fathers, and that suits us better and  better. We are developing a taste for it. Soon we shall contrive to be  born somehow from an idea. But enough; I don09t want to write more from  0cUnderground.0d    [The notes of this paradoxalist do not end here, however. He could not  refrain from going on with them, but it seems to us that we may stop  here.]              *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK NOTES FROM THE UNDERGROUND ***              '\""
